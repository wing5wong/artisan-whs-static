I am the newest member of the team. I am originally from Whanganui and have returned after many years away. I have a lot of experience working with international students, having already worked as a director at a large boysâ€™ school. My children grew up surrounded by international students and it has helped shaped them into wonderful, caring adults. I have also lived and worked overseas so understand the joy, excitement and difficulties of transitioning to a new way of living. I also know the rewards of having new experiences and making new friends in another country.  

I oversee the department and will visit agents and families who are interested in choosing Whanganui High School. I am happy to be back in Whanganui as it is such a beautiful small city. I am also excited to be working with a kind, caring team who have a lot of experience with international students. Our team will ensure that Whanganui High School is a great choice for you, as a study destination.
