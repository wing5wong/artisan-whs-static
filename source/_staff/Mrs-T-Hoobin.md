I am originally from Whanganui but lived overseas for twelve years and have travelled extensively. I know what it is like to adjust to new cultures and ways of living. I returned with my Australian husband to raise our family in Whanganui as it offers a wonderful lifestyle. 

I am responsible for all enrolments, administration and general enquiries. I also help with insurance claims and student visas. I am usually the first person to receive and respond to emails. I enjoy helping our international students to have the best experience and to fulfil their dream of an international study experience and have been in this role since 2010.
