Originally from Warsaw, Poland, I emigrated to NZ with my family in 2006 and love it here in Whanganui. My son, Hardy, is a student at Whanganui High School. I have a degree in tourism and lived in many different countries before I came to New Zealand. I embrace world cultures, love travel, meeting people and learning about new countries. I am a positive, enthusiastic person and love working with international students.

I support international students every day, during school hours. I am with our students from day one; helping with orientation, in the classroom and assisting with everyday needs and tasks. I organise and take students on trips, to add to the Whanganui High School experience.

I am excited to be the new Homestay Co-ordinator for 2021. I plan, organize, manage and monitor the Homestay needs of the WHS International Students so that they are well cared for and ensure that our department complies with relevant codes and standards. I make sure we match our international students with the right families, based on their interests and preferences. I love working closely with homestay parents to ensure a great experience for both students and host families. We have a great range of wonderful homestay families who love hosting our international students. I look forward to working with you.
