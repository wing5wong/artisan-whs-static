Originally from Warsaw, Poland, I emigrated to New Zealand
with my family in 2006 and love it here in Whanganui. With a Bachelor of
Tourism and having lived in many different countries, I embrace world cultures
and enjoy travel, meeting people, and learning about new places. I am a
positive, enthusiastic person and love working with international students.

I support international students during school hours,
helping with orientation, classroom activities, and everyday needs. I also
organize trips to enhance their Whanganui High School experience.

As the Homestay Coordinator, I plan, organize, manage, and
monitor the homestay needs of our international students to ensure they are
well cared for and that our department complies with relevant codes and
standards. I match students with the right families based on their interests
and preferences. I enjoy working closely with homestay parents to ensure a
great experience for both students and host families. We have a wonderful range
of homestay families who love hosting our international students. I look forward
to working with you.
