    title: International Support Person

Originally from Warsaw, Poland, I emigrated to NZ with my family in 2006 and love it here in Whanganui. My son, Hardy, is a student at Whanganui High School. I have a degree in tourism and lived in many different countries before I came to New Zealand. I embrace world cultures, love travel, meeting people and learning about new countries. I am a positive, enthusiastic person and love working with international students.

I support international students every day, during school hours. I am with our students from day one; helping with orientation, in the classroom and assisting with everyday needs and tasks. I organise and take students on trips, to add to the Whanganui High School experience.
