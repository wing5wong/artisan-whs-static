I have worked at Whanganui High School since the beginning of 2011. Originally from Harbin, I first came to New Zealand as an international student and studied languages, teaching and education at the University of Auckland. With my experience, I have an insiderâ€™s knowledge of what it is like to be an international student in New Zealand. I met my wife in Auckland and we have two young children who attend primary school. I love football and play in the local league.

I am the advocate for the international students and am responsible for their pastoral care and academic monitoring. I can be contacted by students and homestays at any time. I also organise activities and trips for our students.
