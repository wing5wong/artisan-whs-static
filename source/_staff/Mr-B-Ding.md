I have been a part of the Whanganui High School team since 2011. Originally from Harbin, I came to New Zealand as an international student and studied languages, teaching, and education at the University of Auckland. My personal experience gives me a unique understanding of what itâ€™s like to be an international student in New Zealand.

As the International Dean, I am the advocate for our international students, responsible for their pastoral care and academic monitoring. I am always available to support students and homestays and organise activities and trips to enrich their experience. Outside of work, I enjoy playing football in the local league. My wife and I have two young children who attend primary school.
