We are the teachers of International English and love working with second language learners. We have a flexible programme designed to advance the language skills of English Language Learners. All students can work towards success in their individual goals by means of graduated levels in NCEA English Language (previously ESOL) and/or English, and English for Academic Purposes standards.
