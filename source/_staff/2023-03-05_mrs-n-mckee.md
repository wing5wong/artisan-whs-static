As the Director of International Students at Whanganui High
School, I look forward to welcoming students into our vibrant community. Our
goal is to create a supportive environment where students from around the world
can grow both academically and personally. Drawing from my own experiences
studying abroad in Japan, I understand the unique challenges and opportunities
of studying in a new country.



We are
excited to welcome students to Whanganui High School, where they will find a
nurturing and inclusive atmosphere that encourages each student to reach their
full potential. Our international department staff works collaboratively to
ensure every student receives the support they need to succeed and feel at
home.
