I emigrated to NZ with my husband Mike and young daughter in 2009 from the UK. We came straight to Whanganui as Mike was starting work as a Science teacher at Whanganui High School and I have family here too. I have a degree in Environmental Biology with international education that I gained in the UK. While here in New Zealand I have studied to become a qualified Careers Advisor, as helping students, international and domestic, to find a good fit for their life after school is a passion of mine. I have two young daughters who love meeting and being involved with the international students. 

I began as the homestay co-ordinator in March 2018. I match international studentsâ€™ wants and interests with one of our many lovely families around the city. I am in constant contact with our homestay families to ensure a great experience for our students and their homestay families.
