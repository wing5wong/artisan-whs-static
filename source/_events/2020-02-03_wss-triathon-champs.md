This year the WSS Triathlon has changed to a Aquathon due to new health and safety rules on the road which means we cannot do the bike leg of the event.  
So it is now a run/swim/run event on 10 March, 12noon - 2.30pm.

There are 3 age groups U14, U16, U19.  
U14 - 1km run, 200m swim, 2km run  
U16/19 2km run, 400m swim, 3km run  

This will still be held at the Multisport Club by the River.

Sign ups are with Mrs Murphy in her office, Te Wehi Gym Foyer.  
There are NO team events this year.  
If you are keen to do this event please see Mrs Murphy before Thursday 5 March.  
NO LATE ENTRIES.
