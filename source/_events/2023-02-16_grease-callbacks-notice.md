GREASE CALLBACKS NOTICE:  

Unfortunately the new scripts haven't arrived for Grease (beyond our control).  
Because of this, call backs have been rescheduled to WEDNESDAY 22 FEBRUARY AT 3.15pm.  
Once we have received the scripts you will hear from us!

ALL OTHER students who auditioned - sit tight, lists for other minor roles, chorus, dancing etc will be posted after Wednesday.  

Thanks for your patience
