We will run Periods 2, 3 and 4 classes only on Wednesday, 15 June and Thursday, 16 June.


Students will need to be at school before 10:00am on those two days and will depart school by 2:00pm. 


All school buses will still run at the normal times and our School Library will still be open between 8:30am and 4:30pm each day.

Please Note:  
Courses will start as normal this Wednesday and Thursday.  
UCOL is 9.00 and the PITO and AGC buses will be in the bus bay at the usual time of 8.30. Finish time is also the same as previous week.  
Any queries see Mrs Howard in Vocational Studies Office by D8.
