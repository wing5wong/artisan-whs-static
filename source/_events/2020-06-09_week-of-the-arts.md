Normality is just around the corner and to celebrate this the Cultural Prefects are hosting a "Week of the Arts", starting Monday 15 June. 

Monday we will begin with chalk drawings down centre court, and on Wednesday we ask you to join us in the Hall for a beginner and advanced dance class! 

No need to sign up, just show up!!! 

And finally to wrap up on Friday we will be having the famous Open Mic for those who missed out on Valentines Day or just want to try it out this time.  Sign up here [bit.ly/weekofartsopenmic2020](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1K8BdEsB9ogAV0tPLJNlXWK_FzHHXKgZmnC9rgcXEErY/viewform?edit_requested=true).

We hope to see you all there - feel free to talk to any of our Cultural Prefects if you have any further questions.
