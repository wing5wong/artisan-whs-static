Whanganui High School Formal Function/Ball in on Saturday 10 July.  

The Ball is a formal event for Year 13 students and their partners. Partners may be Year 12 or Year 13 students from any Secondary School in New Zealand. If the partner is in Year 11, special permission has to be got from Mrs Spooner. There is a provision for 'outside' partners - who do not attend school. In this case, a formal letter addressed to Mrs Spooner requesting permission, has to be provided along with photographic evidence of the partners identity (eg a drivers' licence or passport). Those applying in this case, will be interviewed by Mr McAllen and Mrs Spooner.
