This year WHS Junior School will ALL be going down to Cooks Gardens on Thursday 30 November for the Tough Teens Fun Afternoon for all Secondary Schools. 

Students competing will come to school in their WHS PE uniform (green/gold top/black shorts).  
Students watching/marshal will come to school in school uniform.

Students will go to Period 1, form time and Period 2, then we will walk down together as a school to Cooks Gardens. The cost to participate in the Tough Teens obstacle course is $3. You can walk with your friends or run the course.  

This week in form time you will be shown a short video of what tough teens is about.  

Points are awarded to each school for the following things: school banner, school spirit (chants, dress up), school mascot, competitive races and tug of war points.  
School with the most points will be awarded the tough teen trophy.  

More information will be out closer to the day, but for now sign up with your form teacher and get ready for some fun in the sun!!  

Any questions see Mrs Murphy in the Te Wehi Gym Office.
