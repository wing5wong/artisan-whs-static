CAA Literacy and Numeracy Examinations.\
Wednesday 10 September to Friday 12 September. 

If you are Year 10-13 and do not yet have Literacy or Numeracy, you will be entered into CAA.  

CAA: EXAMINATIONS THIS WEEK

As you will be aware, the COMMON ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES (CAA) will take place take this week.\
Over that 3 day period we will administer over 720 assessments.  

There will be two sessions per day: 8.45 and 12.45.\
The minimum length of time is one hour, but students may stay as long as they need, so they will have plenty of time.

Wednesday 10 September\
Reading\
8.45 Y11-13, plus Y10 bus students\
12.45 Y10

Thursday 11 September\
Writing\
8.45 Y11-13 plus Y10 bus students\
12.45 Y10

Friday 12 September\
Numeracy\
8.45 Y11-13 plus Y10 bus students\
12.45 Y10

All students have received a timetable and will know their venue and exam session. Students are expected to be at the correct exam room with a charged device at the correct time.  It is very important that students are at school on time if they are writing in the morning session.  

When students are not in a CAA assessment, they are expected to be in class as normal. There is no exam leave for students in Y11-13 at this time. Normal classes run alongside the CAA exams from Wednesday onwards.

Because this is an NCEA exam, these arrangements take precedence over everything else.

Any students with timetable queries or log in problems or device issues should see me before Wednesday.  All students have been given access to practice materials. It is my hope that students will use their time productively this week to ensure they are ready.

If you have any questions or queries, please do contact me.
