There will be an important INFORMATION MEETING for our 2020 Production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang 1st break this Wednesday, 5 February in the School Hall.  

We are looking for actors, dancers, singers and basically anyone who wants to get involved in this fabulous production which will take place in Term Two. Rehearsals begin next week!  

At the meeting all your questions will be answered and audition sheets will be given out. The auditions will take place after school on Monday 10 and Tuesday 11 February.  

You'll also be given information about the dances, and there will be an opportunity to come and learn the audition dance on Friday 7 February also at lunchtime.
