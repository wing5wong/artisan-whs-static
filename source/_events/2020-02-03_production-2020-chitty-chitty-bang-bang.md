**WHS 2020 Production - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang**  

We are looking for actors, dancers, singers and basically anyone who wants to get involved in this fabulous production which will take place in Term Two. Rehearsals begin next week!

[Information for students auditioning](https://res.cloudinary.com/whanganuihigh/image/upload/v1580869511/Events/Lead_Character_Breakdown.pdf)

The auditions will take place after school on Monday 10 and Tuesday 11 February at 3.15pm in the School hall. An extra audition slot is scheduled for Tuesday 11 February at first break for those who genuinely canâ€™t make the afternoon auditions.  Please tick your name off on the list at the hall indicating which audition you will attend. See you there!
 

There will be one more opportunity to practice the dance audition at First Break today.

Watch this space and the Performing Arts Facebook page for the dance and music videos which will be made available this week.  

For any extra questions, talk to the Performing Arts teachers.
