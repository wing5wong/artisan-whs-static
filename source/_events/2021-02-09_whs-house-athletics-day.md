💚💛💙❤️  

**Click on bit.ly/whshouse for information regarding schedules & points updates throughout the day!** 👍
 



•	All students are to **go straight to Cooks Gardens** in the morning.

•	**Competitive athletes are to be there by 8.30am, and *all other students must be there by 9.30am.***

•	**Buses will run as usual.** Students should get off at City College and walk to Cooks Gardens from there. At the end of the day, bus students will catch the bus from City College.

•	On arrival students are to go straight to the Main stand, and sit in form class groups under House banners, then attendance rolls will be taken.

•	Students are encouraged to wear House colours. Face paint is allowed but must be applied at home. Cooks Gardens management have a zero tolerance of inappropriate use of paint on their facility. Students must respect this!

•	We also have six fun activities situated around the outside of the track for ALL students to get involved in. House points will be given for participation. 

•	**Everyone is to stay on site throughout the whole day.** If a student has an appointment – for example, doctor or dentist -  then they must report to Mrs Barr at the First Aid tent before leaving the grounds. She will issue a pass.

•	We have the Maori Wardens assisting us on the gates. 

•	There will be food, drink and coffee vans on site all day. **Students need to bring their lunch and a water bottle.** A water fountain is available to top up bottles and we also have sun screen stations.

•	We recommend that students **do not bring laptops/tablets** to athletics, and **cell phones are strictly the responsibility of their owners.**

•	Students need to **come prepared for the weather conditions.** Sunhats and sunscreen, and something warm to wear if the weather is not so hot.

•	We have a First Aid tent on site all day.

•	Again this year, our Public Health nurses are setting up an information marquee promoting Sun Smart – Slip, Slop, Slap, and Wrap. They will also be promoting drinking water rather than cordial or fizz.

•	**Parents are welcome to come** and support sons and daughters. 
If you cannot come we have a Website with live updates throughout the day. Go onto bit.ly/whshouse and find out if your son or daughter is in any finals, and how their House is going. 

•	If by any chance the weather turns bad, cancellations will be on our WHS Facebook page, WHS Sport Facebook page and WHS website by 7am. 


We are looking forward to an awesome day, filled with School spirit, fun, participation and lots of House support for our top athletes as they showcase in front of the whole school. 

Please phone the school if you have any questions.
