**2025 WHS Cultural Festival**  
**Saturday 14 June in the School Hall**

The WHS Cultural Festival is back this year, and we are thrilled to invite students from all countries (including New Zealand) to participate and represent their unique cultures at Whanganui High School! This festival is a celebration of diversity, creativity, and unity, and we want YOU to be a part of it.  

This year, we are encouraging students from different cultural backgrounds to showcase their cultural heritage; there’s a place for all cultures at our festival. Here’s how you can participate:  

Come to our 1st meeting TODAY (28 February 2025) at 2.10pm in Library and we discuss the ways to get Involved...  

Performances:  
Share your country's music, dance, or drama! Whether it’s traditional dance from Greece, a K-pop performance, or a Bollywood routine, we want to see your talent! 

Traditional Attire:  
Come dressed in the traditional clothing of your homeland and wear it proudly. Whether it’s a Kimono, Sari, or Sombrero, it’s a great way to express your culture.  

Cultural Food:  
Can you cook? If yes, you are in.  

Volunteers:  
We need help to make the festival run smoothly! Join us as a volunteer to assist with setting up, managing stage, or helping guests navigate the event.  

Why Participate?  
Celebrate the diversity within our school community.  
Share your culture with others and learn about new ones.  
Enjoy food, music, dance, and performances from around the world!  

Let’s make this Culture Festival the most exciting, vibrant, and inclusive event ever.  
No matter where you’re from, your culture is something to be proud of, and we can't wait to see what you bring to the festival!  

Looking forward to seeing all of you in our first meeting.  

If you would like to participate but can NOT attend today, do NOT worry. We will have another meeting next week.  

Any questions, please contact Mr Ding OR event representative Ananya Jijo.
