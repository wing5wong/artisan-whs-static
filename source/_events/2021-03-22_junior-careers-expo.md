Whanganui High School is participating in the Whanganui Junior Careers EXPO on Friday 26 March at the Racecourse. 

This is a good opportunity for students in Years 9 and 10 to investigate career and training opportunities that are available through local businesses, training providers, and tertiary institutions: about 80 organisations will be represented. 



All Year 9 and 10 students will be spending 90 minutes at the Whanganui Junior Vocational Expo being held at the Raceway. All students will have tasks to complete from their Social Studies class as well as two activities at the Expo to go into the drawer for three $50 Stirling Sports Vouchers and numerous Apple / itunes cards.

**Year 9 students:** Make sure you get to Form Time quickly on Friday, have your name checked off and move to an assembly in the hall. From there we will make our way in two groups down to the Expo at Whanganui Raceway. You will be returning, as a group, to school early in period 2.

**Year 10 students:** Go to Formtime & Period 1: At 10am, a notice on the school speaker system will ask you to move to the hall for your assembly. We will then walk down to the Expo returning at 11.30.
