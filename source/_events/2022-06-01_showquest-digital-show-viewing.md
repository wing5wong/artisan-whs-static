Our Showquest performance was professionally recorded last Friday and it has been collated with other schools in the Manawatū to create: Showquest Manawatū Digital Show and ‘Virtual Prize Giving’

There will be a ‘viewing evening’ at school in the hall 3:45PM THIS Friday, 3 June, for any students and staff to watch - this will be a mini-movie style showcase of the schools’ performances. 

From 3:45PM – 5:30PM, viewing starts at 4PM.
