Road Safety Education (RSE) is the leading provider of youth road safety education programmes in New Zealand.  We have signed up and paid for our Year 12 students (Thursday 13 March) and our Year 13 students (Friday 14 March) to participate in the flagship RYDA programme for senior high school students across New Zealand and Australia.

More specific details about the RYDA programme as outlined in the rest of this Special Newsletter but please also note that a free presentation and information session is being held for parents and whānau of students of all ages at 5.00 pm, Thursday 13 March (Whanganui Jockey Club, Whanganui Racecourse).

Drivers are at their highest risk of being in a crash during their first year driving unsupervised.  Several factors contribute to the higher rate including: inexperience, risky behaviours such as speeding, driving while fatigued, distraction (phones in particular), not wearing seatbelts, and driving smaller/older cars with fewer safety features.

The RYDA programme addresses this by helping students build social resilience and providing them with the tools needed to make safe choices on the road.  RYDA offers a unique opportunity for young people to set goals and develop strategies alongside the friends and passengers they are most likely to be driving with.

RYDA had a segment which aired on ‘Seven Sharp’.  You can watch it on demand here:
