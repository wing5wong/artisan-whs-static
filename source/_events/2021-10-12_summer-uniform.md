Parents are reminded that Andersons Uniforms, is our uniform outlet.  
Please ensure that your son/daughter’s uniform complies with the regulations.

We do appreciate your support with all uniform requirements, as we like our students’ personal presentation to reflect their pride in being a pupil here.
