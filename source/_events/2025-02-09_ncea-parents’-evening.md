NCEA Parents’ evening - Thursday 27 February.  
5.30pm in the School Hall.

As your son/daughter is embarking on the first level of the NCEA qualification, this will be a good time to come and hear how it works.  

There have been significant changes made to Level 1 over the past year, and you will have an opportunity to ask questions.  

I will be running the meeting together with our Academic Dean, Mrs de Smidt.

It will not be a long meeting, and we would like to see you there.

Kind regards  
Elizabeth Spooner  
Deputy Principal in charge of Year 11
