**Whanganui High School Rowing/Pak n Save Grab Prizes**
 

2 x prizes will be drawn. Both are 4-minute Grocery Grabs.  
1st prize worth up to $500.00.  
2nd prize worth up to $250.00.  
The prizes will be drawn and winners notified on December 2nd.  
If a winner cannot be contacted within 48 hours, then a re-draw for that prize will occur. 


**Rules and Conditions**  
1. The Grocery Grab will take place at Pak n Save Wanganui, 167 Glasgow St, Whanganui on Sunday 8th December at 8.30am. Both winners of the prizes must arrive at 8.15am for a briefing and welcome. 
2. If a winner is unable to attend for any reason, they are permitted to appoint someone else to take their place, and they must notify Whanganui High School Rowing Committee Member Lisa Murphy (0276669884) of the change 24 hours prior to the event. Failure to do so may result in the forfeiture of the prize. Each participant must notify Pak n Save Wanganui of any special needs or requirements he/she has that may impact on the participant undertaking the Grocery Grab e.g. whether wheelchair access or a support person is required. 
3. Winners will toss a coin to who goes first and second and must follow a pre-determined map/direction as set out by Pak n Save Wanganui management. Due to the supermarket being open for general customers at the same time, the map/directions must be followed to minimise disturbance to other shoppers. 
4. Each participant will get 4 minutes to collect as many groceries as possible to the maximum value of their prize, either $500 or $250. Only items in the trolley when the 4 minutes are up are included in the prize. 
5. The participant may not select more than 1 item of the same product. 
6. The Grocery Grab excludes all tobacco, alcohol, electronic goods, grocery vouchers, phone cards, lotto products, DVD’s, cosmetics valued at over $50, pharmacy items and gift cards. 
7. The total of the trolley of groceries will be calculated at a designated check out on completion of the 4 minutes. If the value is more than the prize total ($500 or $250), the participant can choose which items they will remove to get the total down to the prize value OR pay the difference in the actual value of the goods and the prize value. Should the trolley value be less than the prize value, this will be the total of the participant’s Grocery Grab. If there is a short fall, this cannot be claimed in goods or cash at all. 
8. By entering this competition, you agree to the following: 


**Exclusions and Liability**  
Whanganui High School Rowing and Pak n Save Wanganui and its related companies, employees, committee, volunteers and agencies shall not be liable for any loss, damage or personal injury (including but not limited to indirect or consequential loss) suffered by any person arising directly or indirectly out of or in connection with entering this Grocery Grab, except as required by Law.
