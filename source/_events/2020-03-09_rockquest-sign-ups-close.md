Rockquest sign ups are now open for the Whanganui region!  

You will need to go online and sign up through the SmokeFree Rockquest website.  

If you have any issues signing up please see Miss Matthews in the music room office for help.  

Once you have signed up you will have to print out a 'contract' that needs to be signed by ALL band members and then handed to Miss Matthews in person!  

These are to be handed in no later than Wednesday, 18 March.
