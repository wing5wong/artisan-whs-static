On Friday 2 August we are running the 'Loves Me Not' programme for all Year 11s (as per the email home at the end of last term with all the information).  

Thank you to all students who signed up for a group.  
If you have not done so, please go to [bit.ly/whslove2024](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXJ3wVfYuC61tgMWIEr1Cg5vUUuz2gTD7PTTx3vry4-8ghdA/viewform) and get the chance to pick the same group number as your friends.  
We will fill the gaps for students who do not pick their own groups.
