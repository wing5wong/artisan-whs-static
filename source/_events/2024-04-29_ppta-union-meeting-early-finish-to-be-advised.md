PPTA members across the Whanganui region will be meeting together at 1.15pm on Thursday, 16 May.  

Please note that our timetabled classes will need to finish at the end of Period 3 (12.50 pm) on Thursday, 16 May, to enable PPTA union members to attend the union meeting. Students are expected to go straight home and not into town.  

Our school buses will continue to run at their normal times and students who need to stay at school will be supervised by non-PPTA union members in the School Library. All other school operations will run as normal.
