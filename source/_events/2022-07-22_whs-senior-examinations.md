WHS Senior Examinations  
Thursday 15 September â€“ Friday 23 September

Most subjects will be offering an examination or time to complete portfolios/technology projects, and students are expected to attend these. Study leave is a privilege not a right. 

Some students will be invited to attend extra classes during the examination period, to help them gain credits. This is often offered to students who need Level 1 Literacy and Numeracy credits.

Parents of these students will be contacted.
