In 2023, nearly one in five children in New Zealand are still living in impoverished conditions, which means that they will be lacking access to enough nutritious food that would sustain themselves daily.  

Whanganui High School has partnered up with City Mission to host this year's annual Can Drive!  

The more food you bring, the more points you will raise for your house!  
Bring in as many non-perishable goods as you can spare to your form class. Non-perishable goods consist of food such as canned goods, dry foods, and toiletries like shampoo and body wash.  

This year's annual Can Drive starts on 7 August and ends on 25 August.  
Put together some canned goods and get ready for this year's Can Drive!
