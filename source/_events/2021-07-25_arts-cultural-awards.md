Our Arts/Cultural Awards will be held on Thursday, 21 October.

Awards Time !!!  
There is nothing better than celebrating the success of our students and we love to do that in style.  
Please note this event can only take place in Alert Level 1 - so fingers crossed Covid plays ball and we can hold this event.  
TICKETS ARE $12 from the WHS Student Centre or Main Office.
