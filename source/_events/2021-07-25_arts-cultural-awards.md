Awards Time !!!  

Our rescheduled Arts/Cultural Awards will be held in our School Hall on Tuesday, 2 November at 7pm.  Drinks and Nibbles 6-7pm.


There is nothing better than celebrating the success of our students and we love to do that in style.  
Please note this event can only take place in Alert Level 1 - so fingers crossed Covid plays ball and we can hold this event.
