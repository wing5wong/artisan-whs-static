Thank you to those who returned the permission slip promptly. Unfortunately, due to the extension of Covid-19 level 2 restrictions, UCOL have reluctantly decided to cancel their 'on-site' open days this year - Palmerston North 25 Aug and Whanganui 1 Sept. 

UCOL staff will visit Whanganui High School later this term to meet with students interested in studying with them.
