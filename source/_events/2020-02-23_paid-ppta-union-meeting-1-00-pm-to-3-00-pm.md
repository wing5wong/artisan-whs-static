The Executive of the Post Primary Teachers' Association (PPTA) has directed members throughout New Zealand to attend a round of branch-based paid union meetings held under the provisions of Section 26 of the Employment Relations Act 2000.

The meeting of PPTA members at Whanganui High School will be held on **Wednesday, 26 February from 1.00 pm to 3.00 pm.**

85% of our teaching staff are PPTA members so we will need to **close for teaching instruction at the end of Period 3 (12.50 pm)** this Wednesday; however, our non-PPTA teaching staff members will provide supervision of students who remain on the school site until the end of the normal school day. If you wish your daughter or son to remain at school until normal finishing time, they will need to assemble together in the school library at 1.00 pm on Wednesday.

Please note that school buses will continue to run at their normal departure times.
