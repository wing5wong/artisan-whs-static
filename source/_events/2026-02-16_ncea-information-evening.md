We warmly invite you to attend a Year 11 Information Evening for parents and caregivers on Tuesday 17 February from 5:30pm, in the School Hall.  
We invite you to share some kai with us from 5:30pm, and our meeting will start at 5:45pm. 

Year 11 is significant as students begin their NCEA journey. It is important that whānau are on board from the beginning so you can provide strong support at home and help reinforce the value of engaging in learning and gaining credits from the get-go.

The evening will aim to:
- Support parents’ understanding of NCEA structure and expectations
- Highlight the importance of building early momentum in earning credits
- Encourage a strong school–home partnership for learning success
- Provide clarity and confidence around supporting your rangatahi through their NCEA journey.

A second, and very important, purpose of the evening is to meet our Academic Dean, Mrs de Smidt. Many of you may already have been in contact with her last year regarding the Common Assessment Activities (CAAs). Mrs de Smidt will explain how NCEA and the credit system works and will be available afterwards for general questions and inquiries.
