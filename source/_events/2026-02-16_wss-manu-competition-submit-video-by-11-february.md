Whanganui Secondary Schools Manu Competition, 2026.

The 2nd Annual Manu Competition is happening on 17 February, and spots are limited. 

Competition grades are: Junior Boys, Junior Girls, Senior Boys, and Senior Girls.  
To be considered, please submit a video of your best manu to the Te Wehi gym office by Wednesday 11 February.  

The team travelling to Whanganui Girls’ College will be selected based on these videos.  

Our own Year 13, Romeo Newton, took out the win last year — let’s go back-to-back!  

Please see Miss Madams if you have any questions, in the Te Wehi Gym Office.
