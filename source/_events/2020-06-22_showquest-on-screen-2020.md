Whanganui High Schools Performing and Visual Arts Departments are very proud to announce that we will be entering '[ShowQuest On Screen](https://showquest.nz/showquest-on-screen/)'.  

ShowQuest On Screen is a chance for students to showcase a story or a theme of their choice through dance, drama, music, technology, projection and wearable art!

It is an entirely student led project which gives seniors some really great opportunities for leadership! 

This year the students have chosen to showcase the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake. The students hope to raise awareness about this natural disaster whilst learning about it themselves. The discoveries they have already made are very eye opening. 

This year the student will have to film and edit a video of the performance which is due on 28 of August! We cannot wait to show you all what we have been working on!!
