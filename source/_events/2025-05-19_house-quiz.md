House Quiz 2025 is on Friday 13 June, from 12 until 2pm (periods 3 and 4) at the Jubilee Stadium.

Students that have signed up can collect a slip from their form teacher for leaving school.  
On Friday, students get changed into House colours at break (no face paint) and at 11.40 make their way over to the Jubilee Stadium via the walkway.  
Slips will be checked there. No slip no exit from school. 

Please make sure your team has a pen.  
Good luck everyone.  
May the best team win!
