6.30pm to 8.00pm in the School Hall.  

The purpose of the evening is to give you information about our school systems, as well as details about the many opportunities available to Year 9 students. The session in the hall will have key information from staff and our team of Year 13 prefects. It will include details about the course structure for a Year 9 student, technology advice (Google Classroom, 'Bring Your Own Technology' device use, Kamar - our student management system and parental access to this), reporting systems and Student Achievement Conferences, plus the extra-curricular options available and how to sign up.  

After the session in the hall we will all move to the library for a chance to ask any questions directly of staff and to mix with other parents. There will be help desks set up for technology, sport and the pastoral teams. Our houses of Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua will have the deans available for any questions you may have.
