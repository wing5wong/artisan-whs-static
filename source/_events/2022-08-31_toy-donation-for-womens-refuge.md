For a year 11 social assessment we are doing a social action.  

We would like to collect old toys that are still usable and donate them to children in need. We will donate them to a group called Women's Refuge. They are a non-profit organisation that works to help people who have fallen victim to domestic abuse. They offer a confidential, supportive, and non-judgmental service. So, to raise awareness we would like to collect toys from students from Wanganui High School and give them to children in need so they can be raised with toys to play with and have a better childhood.  

Please take the toys to F2 at any time until Friday 9 September.
