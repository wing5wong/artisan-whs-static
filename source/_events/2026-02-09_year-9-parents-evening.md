Year 9 Parents Evening will be held on at 6pm starting in our School Hall on Wednesday 18 February.  

The purpose of the evening is to give you information about our school systems as well as details about the many opportunities available to our Year 9 students. 

The session in the hall will have key information from staff and our Year 13 Prefects.  

This will include:  
-Kamar portal for parents (our online student management system)  
-Google Classroom (our online classroom)  
-Reporting Systems  
-Extra curricular options available and how to sign up

After the session in the hall we will move to the library for a chance to ask questions directly to Form teachers, Year 9 Deans, Senior Leadership, Prefects and to mix with other parents & whānau. There will be help desks set up for technology, sport and pastoral teams. 

We are looking forward to seeing you there and also to a successful year filled with growth, learning, positive relationships and memorable experiences.

If you are unavailable to come you are most welcome to contact your son/daughters's form teacher, subject teachers or our Year 9 Deans with any questions.
