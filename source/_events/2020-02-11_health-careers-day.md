Whanganui DHB is hosting an information event regarding career opportunities in the Health Sector (not just medicine) on Friday 13 March.   

A Whanganui High School group will participate in this event at the base hospital. This is for the morning only, therefore I require that students DO NOT come to school but meet at the hospital.  

Unless I advise otherwise, please meet at Gate 2 in Heads Rd â€“ roughly opp. Cavell Place. 

Please complete the Permission Slip by 9 March, to confirm attendance, using this link:  
https://forms.gle/ArGa1NN3BQY6S9jh6 (preferred option).  
OR return the slip emailed to you to the Student Centre.  
Numbers are limited so return your slips ASAP.  

Reporting time: 8:45am at the Whanganui Hospital, Gate 2, Heads Rd.  
Returning: Via bus to school around 1pm  
Dress: NOTE: School Uniform.  
Transport cost: Nil  
Emergency contact: 027 2782461
