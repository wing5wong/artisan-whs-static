Students are expected to be in Summer Uniform by Tuesday 25 October. This allows a one week change over period. Monday 24 October is Labour Day.  
Parents are reminded that Andersons Uniforms, is our uniform outlet.  
Please ensure that your son/daughter’s uniform complies with the regulations.  
A full list of the uniform requirements is available on the Schools’ website.  
We do appreciate your support with all uniform requirements, as we like our students’ personal presentation to reflect their pride in being a pupil here.  

If you have any questions about any of this information, please phone the School.
