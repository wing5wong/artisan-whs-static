Form time is at the usual time of 8.45am and this will be followed by House Assemblies which will focus on LIFE Diploma awards.

**The Junior Prizegiving starts at 11.00am in the School Hall.** We encourage parents to attend - please be seated by 10.50am - and do not forget to allow time to get from your car park, as parking will be at a premium. The ceremony usually finishes at 12.50pm and students are then issued with their final school reports in their form classes before being released. The reports will be e-mailed that day as well.

Please contact the School is you have any questions or concerns.

Last day for the Junior School.
