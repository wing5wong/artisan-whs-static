Market Day - this Friday!

Year 11 Market Day is happening this Friday, at first break, down centre court.

Bring some cash so you can purchase some delicious kai for lunch. There will be lots of stalls, with many different food items. Keep an eye out for posters around the school this week.

Items can only be purchased with cash, there will be a stall where you can get cash out on the day, but expect delays as last year the line was huge.
