Whanganui Secondary School Swim Champs are being held on 6 August at the Splash Centre.


This year because of Covid earlier on they were pushed out to August. There will be NO Lifesaving, just Swim Champs.


Students interested in taking part please sign up with Mrs Murphy in Te Wehi Gym Office before this Friday 2pm.  
Entries close in the school holidays.  

Any questions please see me in Te Wehi Gym Office.
