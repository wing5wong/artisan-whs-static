Senior School Examinations start on Monday 1 September.

Below is the link for the WHS Examination Timetable.  
This also includes the CAA examinations..

There will be a small number of senior students who have two exams on at the same time.  
DO NOT WORRY!  

I will be sending out personalised timetables soon with instructions for these occurrences.  

Thanks  
Mr Hardy
