These exams start on Monday 1 September and finish on Tuesday 9 September. Exam leave finishes on Tuesday 9 September.  
Normal classes resume on Wednesday 10 September.  

If you have CAA exams on 10, 11 or 12 September: come to school as usual and attend the exam at the correct time as indicated on your exam timetable. There is NO exam leave during CAA.

There will be a small number of senior students who have two exams on at the same time.  
DO NOT WORRY!  

I will be sending out personalised timetables soon with instructions for these occurrences.
