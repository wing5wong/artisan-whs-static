**Year 9 Parents’ evening - Tuesday 18 February  
Starting at 6.30pm in our School Hall** 



The purpose of the evening is to give you information about our school systems as well as details about the many opportunities available to our Year 9 students. The session in the hall will have key information from staff and our Year 13 Prefects.  

This will include:  
-Kamar portal for parents (our online student management system)  
-Google Classroom (our online classroom)  
-Reporting Systems  
-Extra curricular options available and how to sign up

After the session in the hall we will move to the library for a chance to ask questions directly to staff and to mix with other parents & whānau. There will be help desks set up for technology, sport and pastoral teams. Our 4 houses Awa, Maunga, Moana & Whenua will have the Deans available for any questions you may have.
