Industrial Action – PPTA Union Nationwide Teachers’ Strike on Thursday, 16 March
The PPTA Union has advised the Boards of all Area Schools and Secondary Schools throughout New Zealand that its member teachers will be taking strike action on Thursday, 16 March 2023.

Whanganui High School cannot provide normal instruction and staffing during the strike so the school will officially be closed for instuction on 16 March.  We can, however, provide some staff supervision for students under 14 years of age by teachers who are not members of the PPTA Union.

Please email me directly at principal@whs.ac.nz if you are intending for your son or daughter to be at school on 16 March.

Students requiring supervision will need to meet at the flagpole area outside the Deans’ House no later than 8.50 am on 16 March.  The supervised students will have normal break times and will need to be prepared to stay in the school library until 3.05 pm.
