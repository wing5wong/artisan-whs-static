**Timetable for CAA Exams**

All students, Year 10 - Year 13, who will be doing the CAA exams this month need to check their school e mails. An exam timetable was sent to you recently.

If you are doing the CAA in May and do not have a device OR if you think you should have had an e mail and did not get one OR if you have any questions - See Mrs de Smidt.
