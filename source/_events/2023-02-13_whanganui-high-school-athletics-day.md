House Athletics day is Tuesday 28 February held at Cooks Garden for the WHOLE SCHOOL.  

Because of high numbers we need to do prelims in some track and field events on Monday 27 February.  
Please check the Te Mana Gym Notice Board for what these events are.

If you DO NOT show for your prelim you will be scratched from the event and will not compete on Tuesday at House Athletics.  
If you are away on Monday you need to come and tell Mrs Murphy or Miss Morgan in the Te Wehi Gym Office.


ONLY students on the list can come to Prelims. NO MORE ENTRIES ARE BEING ACCEPTED.


You must be changed into your school PE gear ready to go to meet on the school field.


IF you qualify you will then compete again at our House Athletics on Tuesday. You will be told at the end of the Prelim.


See Mrs Murphy and Miss Morgan in the Te Wehi Gym Office if you have any questions.
