YR 9-10 - Tough Teens - Quiet Hour

If you are interested in doing the Tough Teens obstacle course but are too shy or suffer some anxiety or anything else, there is an option to go down to Cooks Gardens in the morning of 20 November to do the course.  
It's not a race, you can do it at your leisure. We will take you down there.  
Please just pop into the gym office and we'll sign you up and give you more information.
