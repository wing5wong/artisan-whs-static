On Wednesday 2 August Massey and UCOL in Palmerston North are hosting an Open Day.  

Thanks to those who registered, you should now have an e-mail with a permission slip. The cost is now FREE, thanks to UCOL providing a bus.  

If you forgot to sign up, there are a few seats left so collect a permission slip from the student centre and have a parent complete the form at: [https://bit.ly/whsmasseyucolperm2023 ](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeWmwoZSPvxJ558mguTC-FBqHWGvaPV6Ae9fNJxPmjHc_hiw/viewform)
