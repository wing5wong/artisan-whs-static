## **End of year exams and portfolios**

The dates for end of year NCEA and NZ Scholarship exams will be delayed by two weeks, to run from **Monday 22 November until Tuesday 14 December.**  Due dates for portfolio submissions will also be pushed back by 2 weeks.

These two changes will give students and schools more time to prepare for the end of the year.

Schools will also not have to provide Level 1 or Level 2 Visual Arts portfolios for NZQA Verification.
This also means there will be more time for students to finish their work, and for teachers to mark it.  

Level 3 & Scholarship Visual Arts  
The amended submission date for Level 3 & Scholarship Visual Arts is now 18 November.  This recognises the impact of the lockdown on the ability of students to complete their Level 3 & Scholarship portfolios (and workbooks).

## Mathematics Common Assessment Task (MCAT) and Digital Technologies & Hangarau Matihiko Common Assessment Tasks (DigiCATs)

We are delaying the NCEA Level 1 Mathematics Common Assessment Task (MCAT) from 14 or 16 September for two weeks – to 28 or 30 September. This will give students who were due to sit the MCAT more time to prepare.

The dates for DigiCATs will be 20 September – 1 October and 18 October – 12 November.

## Other changes

As the length of time we are likely to remain in lockdown becomes clearer, there are extra steps the Government may take, such as reintroducing Learning Recognition Credits, or making changes to
the thresholds for Endorsements and University Entrance. We are working with the Minister’s Professional Advisory Group and schools so that we would be in a position to implement them, depending on the duration of Alert Levels 3 and 4.
