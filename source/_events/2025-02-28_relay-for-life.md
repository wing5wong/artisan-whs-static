Relay for Life, which is a fun Walk in aid of Cancer Research, is coming up on Saturday 22 March.  

We would like to have as many students as possible come along and walk some laps for this wonderful cause.  

All you need to do is sign up on the [bit.ly](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m_5HP0Db6F93C1LI0Loe9zC-QNtA3VEaykewqshW4_U/viewform?edit_requested=true) and get some sponsors and you are ready to go!  
More info is available on the bit.ly.

Teacher in charge*
