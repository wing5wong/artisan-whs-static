**On Thursday 26 November all junior students will participate in the Sport Whanganui ‘Tough Teen’ event to be held at Cooks Gardens.** 

**Form time will run from 9.00am to 9.20am** then students will walk to Cooks Gardens, accompanied by staff. They will register and a race briefing will be held at 10.20am. 

**Students should wear their school PE gear** and, as they will get wet when participating, they need to bring a change of clothes. 

Students may dress up in WHS colours if they want to - there is a best dressed, best school banner and school mascot competition.

**Students will need to bring their lunch, a water bottle, a sun hat, and sunscreen.** There will be some food stalls set up at the venue. 

A reminder that students need to take care of all their personal items especially phones. We recommend leaving laptops/large devices at home for that day.
