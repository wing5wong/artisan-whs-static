From 21 June to 9 July, we will be holding one morning tour and one afternoon tour during normal class lessons on most days of the week for students and family members looking to be a part of our school from 2022 onwards.  

Prior to this I will take enrolment information and information about the tour dates out to contributing schools from Tuesday, 8 June.  

**Please ring our Main Office on 349 0178 if you would like to book a tour for you and your daughter or son.**
