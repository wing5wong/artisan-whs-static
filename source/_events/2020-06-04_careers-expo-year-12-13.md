**The Virtual Careers EXPO - 18 and 19 June.**

The Virtual Careers Expo is a unique opportunity for you to explore some of NZ’s best tertiary education and pathway providers, including Laidlaw College! You’ll be able to visit more than 30 stands hosted by exhibitors across the country, interact through live chat  with staff and student ambassadors, and watch video presentations – all from the comfort of your own home (or school). 

Don’t miss Laidlaw’s video presentation in the Webcast Hub at 3.30 pm on Thursday – or watch on-demand. We’ll be giving a general introduction to Laidlaw, and showcasing our Internship and Education programmes.

The Expo will be a great opportunity for you to get the information you need to map out the next steps in your career journey!
