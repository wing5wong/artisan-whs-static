**Virtual Careers EXPO - 18 and 19 June**  

Even in unusual times like these, our students still have important decisions to make about their futures.

With so many careers fairs being cancelled or postponed this year, we've brought a number of NZ's top providers together to give you the expo experience, virtually! Attendees will have full access to the Virtual Expo Hall, where you can interact with exhibitors, ask questions, and access useful resources that will help you choose the right path.

Thursday 18 June:  12pm â€“ 8pm  
Friday 19 June: 9am - 5pm  
Online (on demand)
