The Secondary School Dodgeball Tournament has been postponed to another date. Sport Whanganui are going to be looking at another date further in the term, so keep looking out on the notices for when it will be.

The bitly will still be open if anyone is keen to put a team in. Reminder that this is a mixed team tournament so you must have at least 2 girls minimum in your team.
