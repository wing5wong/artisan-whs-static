Girls Rugby Tournament.  
Whanganui High School Fields.

🏉 International Rugby in Action! 🏉  

What an incredible start to the week as Whanganui High School and Whanganui Girls' College  co-host the Venus girls’ rugby team from Otemon Gakuin High School, Osaka, Japan!

The excitement is building as we look ahead to Friday’s Mini 7s Tournament, hosted at Whanganui High School. Teams from Otemon Gakuin, Whanganui High School, Whanganui Girls’ College, Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Tupoho and Manukura will take the field for what promises to be an unforgettable day of girls' rugby.  

We can’t wait to see these talented young athletes showcase their skills, sportsmanship, and the power of rugby to bring cultures together. Bring on Friday!
