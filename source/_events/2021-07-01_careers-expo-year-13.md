Thank you to the 80+ students who have signed up for the mini Careers EXPO at UCOL, Palmerston North on Wednesday 4 August. The buses are now full.  

Organisers have requested that students REGISTER. Please check your school e-mail for a link to the registration form (also sent to parent e-mail) - choose the morning session. https://www.eventfinda.co.nz/2021/career-talks-ucol/palmerston-north

Written confirmation of bus times will be in form registers by week's end.
If you are visiting Massey as well, go to: https://opendays.massey.ac.nz/ and register for virtual open day but only get a ticket for Manawatu Campus visit.

Those students involved should have received a confirmation note about this event, in Palmerston North, on Wednesday. Those on the 1st bus (which will also go to Massey) must be at the bus bay before 8am. Those on the 2nd bus, to UCOL only, go to the bus bay by 9am. 

Any issues, see Mr. Keene in LB1 today, Monday 2 August (during form time). Please remember to register on-line with UCOL (and Massey).
