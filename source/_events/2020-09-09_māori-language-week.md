This week is Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori the theme is Kia Kaha Te Reo Māori. 

There will be a pātai/question each morning in Ngā Pānui o te Rā. Write your name/form class (one per student) and answer on a paper and hand into the Student Centre. The winner will be drawn at the end of the day and prize delivered the following morning. This year we will also be having a Form Class Prize. The Form Class with the most entries over the week will be the winners!

RAWE! We had over 100+ entries for Te Pātai o te Rā. We also had an awesome response from our Form Classes with quite a few in the running for Form Class Champions, announced in Fridays Ngā Pānui o te Rā.

Congratulations to Myron Lewenilovo MAUML with the correct answer: Morena / Ata Mārie
