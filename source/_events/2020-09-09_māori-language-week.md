Tēnā koutou katoa. Greetings to you all.  

This week is Te Wiki o te Reo Māori/Māori Language Week and here at Whanganui High School we will be supporting this kaupapa with a range of different activities for Tauira and Kaiako.  

First break Monday-Thursday in Te Wehi gym we will be running ngā taonga tākaro/traditional Māori games, like poi toa, rakaunui and many more, for anyone who would like to take part.  

Every morning this week there will be a pātai in the notices with plenty of prizes up for grabs. All you need to do is write your answer and name on a piece of paper and drop it into the drop-box in the Student Centre to go into the draw.  

Kia kaha, you’ve got to be in to win! 

Whaea Cherie and Matua Tim will be giving out spot prizes for those caught speaking te reo Māori around school.  

“Kia Kaha te Reo Māori” / “Let’s make the Māori language strong”.
