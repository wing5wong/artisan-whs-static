This week is Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori the theme is Kia Kaha Te Reo Māori. 

There will be a pātai/question each morning in Ngā Pānui o te Rā. Write your name/form class (one per student) and answer on a paper and hand into the Student Centre. The winner will be drawn at the end of the day and prize delivered the following morning. This year we will also be having a Form Class Prize. The Form Class with the most entries over the week will be Te Wiki o Te Reo Māori Form Class Champions.

RAWE! Another awesome response with over 100+ entries for Te Pātai o te Rā and a fantastic effort from our Form Classes, Karawhiua!
Congratulations to Liam Wells MOASV with the correct answer: How are you?
