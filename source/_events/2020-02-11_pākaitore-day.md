Ki ngā pāhake, ngā mātua, koutou katoa kua tautoko ngā pihinga o te kura nei.\
E mihi ana i runga i ngā tikanga a kui mā a koro mā. Nōreira, tēnā koutou.

That time of the year again where we take all Whānau Classes and Senior Te Reo Māori classes, to spend the day at Pakaitore, Taupo Quay, for the annual celebration on Friday 28th of February 2020.  We ask that the students meet at Pakaitore on the day under our school tent no later than 8.40am where there will be a roll taken for attendance.  Bus students will be able to leave the venue at 2.45pm to get to the Bus stop at Whanganui City College and Whanganui High school otherwise whanau are responsible for transport to and from venue after 3pm.

The purpose for the excursion is to expose students to our local iwi culture and discussion on historical events surrounding Pakaitore.  There is NO swimming on this day.

Students are required to wear the correct school uniform and must abide by normal school rules at all times.  There will be a selection of food stalls available for purchase of hot food on the day, so they are able to bring money.  Please ensure they bring a hat some lunch and a water bottle.  Those students that do not wish to attend this event will have work set for them to complete at school and go to their scheduled classes for the rest of the day.

Students will be accompanied by myself and 6 other staff members on the day, if you have any queries, please contact me through the school or on 021 027 50320.
