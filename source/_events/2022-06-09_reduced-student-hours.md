Kia ora koutou  

Advance Notice re: **Wednesday, 15 June and Thursday, 16 June - reduced student hours**.  

Our student attendance levels have generally continued to be very good this term and we have continued to operate school as normally as possible in the current Covid environment - thank you for your support.  

On Wednesday, 15 June and Thursday, 16 June we have nine teachers involved in essential Te Ahu o te Reo MƒÅori professional learning development.  During those two days we also have students and teachers involved in the Big Sing Choir Festival (Regent on Broadway, Palmerston North), Level 3 Outdoor Education Bushcraft trips, Level 1 Geography Tongariro trip, and Supported Learning and Progressive classes attending an INZONE Careers session.  

In combination with current levels of teacher and relief teacher illnesses we will not have the capacity to run a full teaching and learning programme next Wednesday and Thursday.  

I have therefore decided that **we will run Periods 2, 3 and 4 classes only on Wednesday, 15 June and Thursday, 16 June**.  

**Students will need to be at school before 10.00 am on those two days and will depart school by 2.00 pm**.  This will enable us to fully staff all classes for both days.  

Please note that all school buses will still run at the normal times and our School Library will still be open between 8.30 am and 4.30 pm each day.  

I apologise for any inconvenience and appreciate your co-operation with these necessary changes.  

Nga mihi nui
