We will run Periods 2, 3 and 4 classes only on Wednesday, 15 June and Thursday, 16 June.


Students will need to be at school before 10.00am on those two days and will depart school by 2:00pm. 


Please note that all school buses will still run at the normal times and our School Library will still be open between 8:30am and 4:30pm each day.
