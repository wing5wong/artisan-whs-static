Nominations are now open for the role of Whanganui High School Board Student Representative.  
This election was originally held last year in September but there were zero nominations received.  
We are therefore required to have another election to elect a Student Representative.

Nomination forms can be picked up from the Student Centre or Returning Officer, Mrs Molan.  

The election will be held on one day only â€“ Thursday 29 February 2024.  
Nominations closed on Thursday 13 February 2024 at NOON.
