The 40 Hour Famine is happening this year from 25-27 June 2021.  
If you'd like to sign up please do so through [bit.ly/whs40hour2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSel49keR0Uaf-AhxnS6NYX9qpFvQ4HpMxzZ35ZCJYv3qlxR_g/viewform).

Bring some cash this Friday and come and buy a sausage (with onions, tomato sauce and butter) at break for $2!! All proceeds will go to World Vision to raise money for the 40 Hour Famine! See you at the back of the gyms on Friday.

Please know that fund-raising is entirely up to you to do yourself. It all goes back to World Vision to help those with less access to education, water, or those who are struggling due to the ongoing pandemic, please consider joining the cause to help those in need.
