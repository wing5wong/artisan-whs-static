Anti-Bullying, or Pink Shirt Day symbolising a stand against bullying.  

This year E-Life Prefects are making a form where you can express your happy thoughts and positive messages to others.  

This will be displayed around the school on Friday so you can see the wonderful comments people have to say.  Leave us a message to show the school using [bit.ly/whspinkshirt2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecxZ5Sxy5sopCeNhJmuc1Bv2CJes0bNID3-qMnJ0v_ZljslQ/viewform).  

We would love to see what you have to say!

Courtesy of the AWA Prefects, you are able to nominate ONE student to receive a piece of baking delivered to them on PINK SHIRT Day (Friday 21 May).  

If you have seen somebody stand up to bullying and misbehaviour, or upholding LIFE values in school, this is your chance to show them that their actions have not gone unnoticed.  

Nominate by using [bit.ly/awapinkshirt2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMJG_AAyWFHDQhE2beAHIJ9FDV1G23lyODc8mPKwxHeuaDWw/viewform).
