**Monday 16 November - Wednesday 9 December**

A reminder from NZQA that School Examinations for Year 11 - Year 13 this year have added importance in the Covid 19 environment. 

Should the November NCEA examinations be effected by a 'Lockdown', your school examination mark may well become your actual mark or 'Derived Grade' so please ensure you have a good study routine in place.
