Gumboot Friday is back, this year falling on Friday 28 May. In 2019/2020, they (iamhope.org.nz) raised 2 million dollars and funded 15.5K counselling sessions for young people in New Zealand. 

â€‹

[I AM HOPE](https://www.iamhope.org.nz/) aims to promote positive attitudinal societal change around mental health throughout New Zealand, and fund private care and counselling for young people stuck-in-the-mud on waiting lists. They offer hope and a voice to young people in our country through various projects including school tours, practical courses such as a barber and barista course, allowing people to share their own journeys through our podcast series 'HopeCast' and much more.
