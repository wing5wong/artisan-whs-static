Our Regional Smokefree Rockquest is on Saturday 26 June at the Wanganui Opera House.  

Please note that for 2021 there will not be a regional heat for Whanganui - all acts entered will go directly to the regional final at the Opera House on Saturday 26 June. No additional acts will be able to be accepted for this event as it is at capacity.
