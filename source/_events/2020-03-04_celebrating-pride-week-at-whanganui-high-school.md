As a large diverse and fully inclusive school, there is student interest in setting up a LGBTQ+ (Rainbow) group at Whanganui High School - I am fully supportive of this happening.

Abby Squire (Head of Culture) and Sophie Andrews (Head of Sport) came to see me a little earlier today about celebrating Pride Week tomorrow (Thursday, 5 March).  We will:

* Fly the Pride (Rainbow) flag on our flagpole tomorrow;
* Have a 'Wear a rainbow accessory day' tomorrow; students will still be in full school uniform but allowed to wear rainbow accessories for the day such as rainbow pins, badges, ribbons, bracelets.  

Thanks very much for supporting our community,

Martin McAllen
