Did you know that in C1 we have set-up a Breakfast Stop for you busy students who have training before school, have to help out with siblings in the morning or just haven't had time for breakfast at home.

Please pass by C1 between 8.00-8.30am and sit down for weetbix or just pop in and grab toast to go.

EVERYONE IS WELCOME!!
