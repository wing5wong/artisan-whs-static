Did you know that in C1 we have set-up a Breakfast Stop for you busy students who have training before school or have to help out with siblings in the morning and don't have time for breakfast at home.

Please pass by C1 between 8.00-8.30am and sit down for weetbix or just pop in and grab toast to go.

EVERYONE IS WELCOME!!

New menu choices arriving soon, depending on response.
