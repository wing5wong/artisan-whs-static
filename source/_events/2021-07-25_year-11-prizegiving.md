YEAR 11 PRIZEGIVING will be held in our School Hall on Thursday 18 November, starting at 1.30pm.  
All Year 11 students are expected to attend. This ceremony should finish at approximately 3.00pm.   

Sadly, due to Covid restrictions parents will be unable to attend any of these prizegivings, but it will be live streamed.

Final reports will be issued to students and sent to families via email.  

This is the last day for Year 11 students.  

(Years 9 and 10 are released at 12.50pm.)
