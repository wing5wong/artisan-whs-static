This is the week where Year 10 to Year 12 students select their courses for next year 2023:  

Year 9 students, your turn will be in Term 4.  



During the week your classes (Year 10 - Year 12) will be time-tabled to go to the Library. You are welcome to come over during your breaks as well but the teachers you need to ask questions of will only be there at specific times.

### Course Selection - Year 9-12 

Reminder - Course selection information & more can be found on the STUDENT PAGES which can be accessed via the WHS Google bookmarks or via [bit.ly/whsstudentpages](https://sites.google.com/wanganuihigh.school.nz/whs-student-pages)
