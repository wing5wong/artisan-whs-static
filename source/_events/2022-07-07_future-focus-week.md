This is the week where Year 10 to Year 12 students select their courses for next year 2023:  

Year 9 students, your turn will be in Term 4.  

Period 1 there is an Assembly for all Year 12 students to let you know about what courses are available for you in Yr 13. Please move to the hall promptly as there is a lot to get through.  
Period 2: Year 10 please go to the hall straight from your period 1 class but SIT with your period 2 class please so teachers can take their rolls.  
Period 3: The following Year 10 classes are to go straight to the LIBRARY meeting Mr Turner & your teachers there: SOC0; MKG :
