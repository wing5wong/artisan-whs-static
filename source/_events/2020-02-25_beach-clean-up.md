This year, Sea Week is during the first week of March.  

To celebrate, and do our part to protect our coastline, the Community Prefects will be holding a beach cleanup. This will be on our Teachers Only Day on Friday 6 March from 9.00-11.00am, meeting at the Castlecliff Duncan Pavilion.  

Bring along a friend and bag to put your rubbish in, and join the competition for a Citadel voucher!
