Girls 1st XI Football trials.  

We will be holding trials for our 1st XI girls team on Wednesday 27 March and Wednesday 3 April at school at 3.30pm.  

It is open to all girls who want to play in our Wednesday competition (you must be available to train on Mondays and play every Wednesday afterschool - sometimes in Palmerston North and/or Masterton).  

Please see Mrs Kennedy if you have any questions.
