We are having our sports exchange against Whanganui Collegiate on Wednesday 17 August. Mr McAllen has allowed students who are keen to support our teams come over for Period 5 to support.


If you are keen to support you MUST sign up with Mrs Murphy in Te Wehi Gym Office, you will then be given a slip in formtime on Wednesday morning, which you MUST show at the London Street Gate as you walk over to Collegiate.


We will be walking over as a school at 2pm from the back of the gyms.


No Slip, No Leaving school. Sign ups close Tuesday 1st break.
