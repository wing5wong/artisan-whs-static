Our Prefect Leadership Camp involves team bonding, communication skills, problem solving and an "Amazing Race" and will be held in Wellington.  

The bus will depart from Whanganui High School at 2pm on Thursday 19 March and will return on Friday 20 March at approximately 6pm.  

Students will stay in school uniform for the trip down to Wellington and can then change into mufti when they arrive at the accommodation, which is the YHA on Wakefield Street.

Students should bring money for dinner (either to purchase from the supermarket - there are cooking facilities at the YHA, or they can buy dinner in town). Students will also be expected to provide their own breakfast and lunch on the Friday. We intend to leave Wellington by 3pm on Friday 20 March, so we will be back by dinner time (approx. 6pm depending on traffic).
