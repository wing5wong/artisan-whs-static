On Wednesday 7 August Massey and UCOL in Palmerston North are hosting an Open Day.  

Those who registered should now have an e-mail with a permission slip.  
The cost is FREE, thanks to UCOL providing a bus.  
If you forgot to sign up, there are a few seats left so collect a permission slip from Mr Keene and have a parent complete the form at: [https://bit.ly/whsmasseyucolperm2024.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNyaGQDYQUvaAuauInZ1KWBEYioHBr4ivfN1y2PqPgZsveVQ/viewform)
