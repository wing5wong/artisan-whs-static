Mufti Day - Rainbow Day  

On Friday 4 March, Whanganui High School is getting involved in Rainbow Day! This is a day showing visual representation and support with our diverse school community. Remember diversity includes culture, religion, disability and pride etc.


So come to school on Friday 4 March in tidy mufti. Wear your rainbow ribbons and badges or go full rainbow from head to toe. 

Please bring a gold coin to go towards our chosen charity of Pride Whanganui. Look out for further information about the day. Thank you.
