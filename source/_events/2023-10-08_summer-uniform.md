Students are expected to be in Summer Uniform by Monday 16 October.  
This allows a one-week change over period.

Parents are reminded that Andersons Uniforms, is our uniform outlet.  
Please ensure that your son/daughter’s uniform complies with the regulations.  
A full list of the uniform requirements is available on the Schools’ website.  
We do appreciate your support with all uniform requirements, as we like our students’ personal presentation to reflect their pride in being a student here.
