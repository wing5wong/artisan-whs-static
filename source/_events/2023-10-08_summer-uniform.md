Students are expected to be in Summer Uniform by Monday 16 October.  
This allows a one-week change over period.

Parents are reminded that Andersons Uniforms, is our uniform outlet.  
Please ensure that your son/daughter’s uniform complies with the regulations.  
A full list of the [uniform requirements](https://www.whanganuihigh.school.nz/info-for-parents/uniform/) is available on the Schools’ website.  

We do appreciate your support with all uniform requirements, as we like our students’ personal presentation to reflect their pride in being a student here.
