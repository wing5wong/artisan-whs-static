**Thursday 10 September - Friday 18 September**

Students are expected to attend these examinations, and all students have been provided with a personalised examination timetable, together with instructions.

Some students may not have qualified to have study leave for the duration of these examinations because they have not attained 75% of the credits they have been offered so far this year. Parents of these students have been notified.

**Examinations commence at 9.05am and 1.10pm.**

If your son or daughter is **sick** then you should contact the Student Centre as usual. Once well, they should see Mrs Spooner who will endeavour to re-schedule the missed examinations.

Students personalised examination timetables were sent to them via their WHS email on Friday 28 August, otherwise view the overall **[Senior Examination Timetable](https://res.cloudinary.com/whanganuihigh/image/upload/v1599451954/Events/2020_Exam_Requests_-_Overall_2.jpg)**
