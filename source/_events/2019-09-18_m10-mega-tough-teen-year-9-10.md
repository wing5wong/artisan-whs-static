The Wanganui Tough Teens is back again this year for Y9-10 students at Cooks Gardens. 

WHS will be taking the 'WHOLE' Y9-10 school to Cooks for the day on Thursday 28 November.


**Schedule for Students on the day:**  

Period 1 will run as usual, and during Period 2, at 10.45am, students will walk to Cooks Gardens, accompanied by staff. They will register and a race briefing will be held at 11.45am.  

Students should wear their school PE gear and, as they will get wet when participating, they need to bring a change of clothes. We encourage students to dress up if they want to - there is a best dressed, best school banner and school mascot competition.

Students will need to bring their lunch, a sun hat, and sunscreen. There will be some food stalls set up at the venue. A reminder that students need to take care of all their personal items especially phones. We recommend leaving laptops/large devices at home for that day.

The race schedule is:  
 Year 9 girls at 12pm  
 Year 10 girls at 12.30pm  
 Year 9 boys at 1pm  
 Year 10 boys at 1.30pm  

Students will be released straight from Cooks Gardens at approximately 2.30pm.
