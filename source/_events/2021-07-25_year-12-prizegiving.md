YEAR 12 PRIZEGIVING will be held in our School Hall on Wednesday 17 November, starting at 1.30pm.  
All Year 12 students are expected to attend. This ceremony should finish at approximately 3.00pm.

Final reports will be issued to students and sent to families via email. 

This is the last day for Year 12 students.
