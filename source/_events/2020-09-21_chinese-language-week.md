Thanks for participating in the 2020 Chinese Language Week, as Confucius said ‘Everything has its beauty, but not everyone sees it’. 

Keep your second language up, it will be useful and helpful for your future. 

Winners for Thursday are: Sam He, Annushka Forrest, Patrick Absolum, Brooke Lammas, and Trent James.  Please come to the Student Centre to collect your prize. 

I am not going to see you tomorrow, the deadline for Friday’s answer is the end of form time. I will deliver the chocolate prize to winners at Period 1.

Today’s question: bit.ly/whs2020chinese.
