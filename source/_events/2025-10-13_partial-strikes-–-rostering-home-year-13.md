**PPTA Union Industrial Action – Important Information  
Partial Strikes – Rostering Home (Week 2, Term 4)**

Between 14 October and 17 October 2025 there will be a series of nationwide partial strikes by PPTA Union Members.

Please do not send students in the year levels below to school on the rostered home day.

All students in all other year levels are expected at school as usual.

I am also including PPTA Union Industrial Action for 23 October, 29 October, and 5 November. 

If the situation changes at any stage, I will update you with new details immediately.

Timing of year levels affected:

Tuesday, 14 October – Year 9 (rostered home)

Wednesday, 15 October – Year 10 (rostered home)

Thursday, 16 October – Years 11 & 12 (rostered home)

**Friday, 17 October – Year 13 (rostered home)**

Thursday 23 October – Full strike (full day)

Wednesday 29 October – Partial strike (extracurricular ban)

Wednesday 5 November – Full strike (two hours)

Hopefully a successful outcome will be able to be reached in negotiations shortly.
