**WHS Senior Examinations** 
(Years 11, 12 and 13)  
**Monday 9 September – Tuesday 17 September**  
**Examinations commence at 9.05am and 1.10pm.**

Students are expected to attend these examinations, and all students have been provided with a personalised examination timetable, together with instructions.

If your son or daughter is unwell then you should contact the Student Centre as usual.  
Once well, they should see me – Mrs Spooner - and I will endeavour to re-schedule the missed examinations.

Most subjects will be offering an examination or time to complete portfolios/technology projects, and students are expected to attend these. Study leave is a privilege not a right.  

Some students will be invited to attend extra classes during the examination period, to help them gain credits.  
Parents of these students will be contacted.
