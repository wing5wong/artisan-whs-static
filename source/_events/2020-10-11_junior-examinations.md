Our Junior examinations in English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies are scheduled for Monday 16 and Tuesday 17 November.  Each examination is two hours in duration and there is a digital component involved in each, so students are expected to bring their devices well charged. 

For these two days, we will be running an altered time schedule as follows:

Form time:  9.00 – 9.20am  
**Exam 1: 9.30 – 11.30am**  
Lunch: 11.30 – 12.30pm  
**Exam 2: 12.40 – 2.40pm**

Students may go home at 2.40pm.  
Buses will run at the normal times and the Library will be open until 4.30pm.
