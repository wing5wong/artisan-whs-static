Our Kapahaka group, Kia Waiora, is performing at the Jubilee Stadium at 1.00pm this Friday as part of the Regional Aotea Manu Korero & Paerangatahi. 

If you would like to go and support them you need to provide a $2.00 koha and register at the Student Centre. Cut off is 3.05pm on Thursday.

On Friday you will be given a ticket at Form Time, so that you can go to the Stadium at the END of Period 3 via the walkway. Names will be checked as you leave.
