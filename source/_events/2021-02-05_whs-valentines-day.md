It is that time of year again!!  

It’s Valentine’s day and love is in the air!!  

The Social Prefects have yummy cookies and cakes for sale to send to that special someone or friend so come and see us by the canteen during 1st break this Friday until Wednesday! The cookies will be $3 and the cakes will be $5. !CASH ONLY! There are limited numbers so get in quick!! 

Cakes and cookies will be delivered to the recipients during the first and second period on Friday the 12th, with an optional note attached. We have gathered a group of around 9 other prefects to help with the day and delivery etc. This will allow us a bit of extra time to set up everything during form time.

We will be having an open mic, working closely with the cultural perfect team to make that happen, featuring students and staff performing songs about love for everyone to enjoy. The cultural prefects will organise the sign up for this.

We will also be having a photo frame going around for everyone to take photos with, having a couple of our amazing photographers take photo’s throughout the day.
