Our Pasifika Awards will be held on Friday, 29 October.

Following Covid-19 restrictions, all prizegivings will now be held in the School Hall with prize-winners and a small number of staff.  
Full public health safety advice will be followed and fewer than 100 people will be in the Hall.  
Where possible, each prizegiving will be live-streamed for families to view remotely.
