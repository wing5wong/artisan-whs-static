This Friday the Community Prefects are hosting a "pink accessory" mufti day.

Please bring a gold coin donation - the proceeds will be going towards Women's Refuge. 

During break we will be supporting anti- bullying next to the Open Mic, outside D-Block. 

Come along for some home baking in return for a compliment. :)
