During the last week of term, Whanganui & Partners are taking a bus load of students to various worksites around Whanganui so that they can have a 'taste' of the job opportunities available in our region. 

There are two options: Manufacturing & Construction, or Agriculture. 

If you wish to be considered for this "roadie" you must sign up using the on-line form at bit.ly/whsjobtaster2020


Numbers are limited and conditions apply, but there is no cost involved.
