During the last week of term, on Monday 21 September and Wednesday 23 September, Whanganui & Partners are taking a bus load of students to various worksites around Whanganui so that they can have a 'taste' of the job opportunities available in our region. 

There are two options: Manufacturing & Construction, or Agriculture. 

Thanks to those who signed up or were nominated. Permission slips are due in on Wednesday 9 September at the latest - the organiser must have confirmed numbers before you go on exam leave. Preferably, parents should return the on-line form at
Bit.ly/whsjobtasterperm2020. 

Remember, lunch is provided.
