Please note that all classes will finish at 1.50pm on Thursday, 21 September. We will be hosting the Inter-school NCEA Moderation Afternoon for teachers from across all Whanganui secondary schools from 2.20pm to 4.30pm.


I will base myself in the Library from 2.00pm onwards and will be available to help any student with their normal Period 5 classroom learning if they require assistance. 


School buses will run at the normal times and the Library will continue to be open until the normal closing time of 4.30pm.
