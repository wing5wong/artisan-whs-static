Pasifika Fusion is in Palmerston North at Regent on Broadway on Wednesday 25 and Thursday 26 June.  
 
Pasifika Fusion Theme 2025:  "PI meets AI"  
How do we honour and balance cultural knowledge and wisdom in a world where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming the norm in educational and professional spaces?  
Thus PI (Pacific Island) meets AI.  

We have about 26 students who are participating in the different categories.  
At the moment we are travelling on both days.

Teacher in charge*
