The Year 12 Health class is running a Wellness Week which involves fun activities to help promote positive mental health. 

Here is the first of our Health Blogs - we will put one in the notices each day this week, looking at different ways of looking after your mental health and well-being. bit.ly/WellnessBlog2

Link to Monday's form class quiz - Work on the quizzes each day as a class, and one person in your form class answer on this google form. There will be a prize for the top form class at the end of the week https://forms.gle/9KyWZMKUyroVKW699

Today's break time activity is basketball - if you signed up, see the sports noticeboard for teams and draw. Tomorrow is Yoga in Te Ihi and Juggling in Te Mana gym. If signed up for yoga, make sure you bring some comfy clothes that you can move freely in.

Don't forget about our Dance Challenge - If you wanna get involved and participate send us a 10-20 second video of you doing your favourite, most quirky dance moves by this Friday.

Positive quote for the day: No pain, no gain!
Need to talk? 1737 is free to call or text from any landline or mobile phone, 24 hours a day 7 days a week. 1737 is designed to meet the needs of anyone who 'wants to talk' to a counsellor. 1737 is not tied to a specific mental health issue or condition. Also, if you are concerned about a friend give 1731 a call.

All participants will get a recognition, and go into a draw to win canteen vouchers and vouchers for sausages at our sausage sizzle on Friday next week.
