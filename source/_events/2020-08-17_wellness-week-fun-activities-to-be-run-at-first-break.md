The Year 12 Health class is running a Wellness Week which involves fun activities to help promote positive mental health. 

Each day we will run different events at first break and there will also be links to activities on the notices. 

Our lunchtime events will have limited numbers, so if interested in participating in Volleyball, Yoga, Learning to juggle, Basketball, or a Jump jam/dance session, please complete this short google form by Friday. https://forms.gle/C3p66SAEnFAHPiPZ6 

All participants will get a recognition, and go into a draw to win canteen vouchers and vouchers for sausages at our sausage sizzle on Friday next week.
