The Community Prefects have organised a CAN DRIVE House competition to donate to the City Mission Food Bank. 

Bring along a can of food, or other non-perishable food items, to your Form Class to earn a house point. 

This will be our final 'House' event for the year!

The final collection date is Friday 30 October.
