**The Year 9 Parents Information evening has been postponed until further notice due to Level 2 restrictions.**

Year 9 Parents’ Information evening is to be held at a future date when we move back to Level 1.  
6.30pm – 8.00pm starting in the School Hall and finishing with light refreshments in the Library.  
(The School Hall will be open from 6.00pm). 


This is an excellent opportunity for parents to hear
about the services the School provides and how to access information related to daughters and sons. For example; device use and google classroom, uniform, extra-curricular sport options, plus it will be a chance for parents to mingle with staff and other Year 9 parents.
