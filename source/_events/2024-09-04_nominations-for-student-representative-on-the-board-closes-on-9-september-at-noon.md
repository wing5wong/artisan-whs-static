One nomination was received for the Student Representative on the WHS Board. Therefore, an election is not required.  

I am happy to advise that the new Student Representative is **Benjamin Ross**. He will take office on 1 October 2024.  

Many thanks to Binuka Wickramanayake, the Board's previous Student Representative, who will be stepping down from this role on 30 September.
