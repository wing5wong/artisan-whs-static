We have our annual Collegiate Sports Exchange on Wednesday 18 August at Collegiate.  

Mr McAllen is allowing students interested in supporting our 1st XI Boys Football team and 1st XV Rugby team to walk across as a group at 2nd break to support.


If you would like to support our teams please sign up at the Student Centre at break times before Tuesday 1st break. You will then be given a pass at form time Wednesday morning to be able to go. Students without passes will not be allowed to attend.


Any queries please see Mrs Murphy in Te Wehi Gym Office.
