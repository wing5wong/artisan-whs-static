Our annual HOUSE QUIZ on Friday 4 June at Jubilee Stadium is starting at 12pm and finishing at approximately 2pm. 

Register your team of 3-5 from people in your house using [bit.ly/whshousequiz2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCVuDX50U_K2zj2MOkoYVioK2deyw8L8-hybePeQqJ7CCmSw/viewform); extra points are awarded to teams from the same form class.  Come up with a thematic team name and go wild with house colours! Get in quick as each house can only put forward 25 teams, may the best house win! 

There are many prizes to be won, get dressed up in house colours at break and get involved!

Students are to get dressed on the day in house colours at break time before heading over to the London Street Crossing across to Jubilee Stadium. Students partaking will be exempt from Period 3 and Period 4 for that day.
