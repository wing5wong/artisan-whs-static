In 2023, 1 in 5 kids worldwide still don't have enough clean water to get through the day, so this year, the World Organisation is working towards helping solve water poverty around the world.

The World Vision 40 Hour Challenge starts at 8pm on Friday 16 June and ends midday Sunday 18th June.
You can try any challenge for 40 hours, by yourself, in a team or complete a challenge with friends!

This year, the community prefects have partnered with The Warehouse to hold a raffle for all participants! Every 5 dollars you raise will get your name in the draw and the winners will be picked after the challenge is over.
