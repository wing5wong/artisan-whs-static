Come and join the Relay for Life and support The Cancer Society.

The event takes place between 12pm and 9pm on Saturday 11 March at Cooks Gardens.  

You can come for part of the day, or all of the day if you want to.  
Registration is $10 payable to school (direct transfer to 12-3163-0095001-00 with your name and Relay as the reference, or pay at the bursars office directly).  
Then,  please register yourself at <https://relayforlife.org.nz/> (scroll down to Whanganui and click signup - select Whanganui High School as your team).  
You can enter the code WHA23 so you don't have to pay or give credit card details (as you pay school and we will give the cancer society one - hopefully big - payment from us).  

You can then share your page and add any extra fundraising.  
There is a fun Battle of the Schools too.  

Please sign up by Friday, 3 March.
