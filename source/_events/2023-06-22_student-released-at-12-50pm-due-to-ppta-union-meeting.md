The PPTA Union are holding paid union meetings throughout New Zealand all of next week to discuss the arbitration process. All PPTA members within the entire Whanganui region are meeting at 1.00 pm on Wednesday 28 June. 

As a consequence **classes will need to finish at the end of Period 3, 12:50pm** on that day to enable PPTA union members to attend the paid union meeting.


School buses will continue to run at the normal times and students who need to stay at school will be supervised by non-PPTA union members in the School Library.
