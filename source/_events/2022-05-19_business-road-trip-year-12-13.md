On Friday 27 May there is an opportunity for 15 senior students to visit some Wanganui Businesses and to explore career pathways. The businesses we will visit are Wight Aluminium, Bremworth Textiles, GDM Design and Manufacturing, and Q West Boat Building.

You will travel around via a bus which has been organised by Whanganui and Partners. There is no cost and the bus will leave our bus bay at 8.45 and return by 3pm.

If you are interested either give your name to your form teacher who will forward it on, alternatively you can see Mrs Howard in the VS Office by D8. 

You have until Friday 20 May to do this.
