Whanganui High School is participating in the Whanganui Careers EXPO. This is a good opportunity for students in Years 12 & 13 to investigate career and training opportunities that are available through local businesses, training providers, and many tertiary institutions: over 50 organisations will be represented.  
The Expo venue is The War Memorial Hall complex in Watt St.  

All Year 12 & 13 students will attend the expo as follows:
  
**Year 12: 8:45-10:15am.**  
Students are to go **directly** to the venue instead of school (Bus students should walk from the City College stop) and will be transported back to school for period 2. Any students who wish to then visit the UCOL open day, will leave from the Expo and return to school for period 3.

**Year 13: 1:30-3:00pm.**  
Transported from school during period 4 and dismissed from the expo.

Mr P. Keene (Careers Advisor) will be assisting at the Expo. Deans and senior staff and class teachers will be present during the day.     


As this is such a large group, and involves an organised activity which will form part of the school day, we will not require individual parental permission in this instance. However, if you do not wish your child to participate, please contact the student centre at school via telephone: 349 0177.

Being a school activity, the usual high standard of behaviour and uniform presentation is expected from students.

Note: there is NO COST for this event either to parents or the school.
