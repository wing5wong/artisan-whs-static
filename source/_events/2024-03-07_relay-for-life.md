The event lasts 20 hours from 3.00pm on the 23 March to 11.00am on the 24 March where you walk around the Cooks Gardens track in teams, showing your support for those affected by cancer.  

There will be a $10 fee per person to enter, bring a friend and get sponsors to help raise money for the Cancer Society.  

See Mrs de Smidt for sponsorship forms.
