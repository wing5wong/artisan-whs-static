Accord Teacher Only Day - Thursday 20 May.  

No school for students, with the exception of our work experience students and the UCOL, PITA and AGC courses which will continue on Thursday as normal, even though it is a teacher only day.

If you are not able to attend see Mrs Howard in the Vocational Studies office by D8.
