You will need to:  

 1. Perform the dance you learned on Monday.

 2. Perform a scene from the Audition Scripts (please familiarize yourself with them on your device, we will provide you with a hard copy at the audition)

 3. Sing a song of your choice, ideally to a track (YouTube/Spotify) or you can accompany yourself.

**24/2/21 WEDNESDAY 3.30pm - 5.30pm** ~ Catch ups for those who are unable to audition on Tuesday. You will need to book a time from Miss Armstrong if you want to audition Wednesday. Some callbacks may also happen on this day.
