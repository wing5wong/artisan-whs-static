The annual Can Drive is back!! This year the Community Prefects are supporting the City Mission and they have a wish list! On this list are items such as: Spaghetti, Beans and Soup. Bringing in any cans of these is worth 2 points!! Bring your cans in during week 4 to your form teachers in order to help your house win!!
