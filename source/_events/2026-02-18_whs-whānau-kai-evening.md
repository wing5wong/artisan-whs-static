E rere kau mai te awa nui, mai i te kahui maunga ki Tangaroa. Ko au te awa ko te awa ko au.

Tēnā koutou ngā whānau whānui o Te Kura Tuarua o Whanganui.

This is an invitation to our whānau to come and spend an evening sharing kai and kōrero with our kaiako and kids at school. 

We invite you and extended whānau to join us for dinner here at A1/Whare on Thursday the 19th of February 2026, beginning at 5pm. Feel free to bring a plate to share and ka pai if not, we would just love to see you all. 

You will be hosted by the Māori Department staff, including Whānau form teachers, our kaiāwhina and also our Māori Heads and Prefects. 

For catering purposes, can you please reply to this email, with numbers of whānau that will attend. Alternatively, you can contact me on 021 02750320.

We look forward to spending the evening with you all. 

Nau mai, haere mai i raro i te manaakitanga o Kia Whaiora.

Naaku noa naa:
