Greetings Whanganui High School

As part of our Daffodil Day fundraiser 4 local High Schools (Including Whanganui High School) will be taking part in a fashion event called Remix Runway. The Fashion design students will showcase their talent and designs on a runway in front of their peers and members of the community.

I have attached the flyer for the evening, could you please share this amongst your staff, student newsletter’s and social media please., feel free to tag ‘Whanganui Cancer Society’  
All proceeds from this event will go straight back into our local office, supporting people in need.

Tickets can be purchased using the QR code on the flyer, from Humanitix or via our facebook page.

Thank you for your support.
