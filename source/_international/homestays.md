## BECOME A HOMESTAY FAMILY

**Welcome an international student into your home and make a lasting impact.**

### Why Host?
Hosting an international student is a rewarding way to:

- Share your culture and lifestyle
- Support a young person’s growth and education
- Build lifelong global connections

Being a homestay family is more than providing a room—it’s about creating a home away from home.

### What We’re Looking For

We welcome families who:

- Have a spare bedroom in the main home (not a sleepout)
- Speak English as the primary language at home
- Are warm, inclusive, and enjoy cultural exchange
- Can set fair and supportive boundaries
- Are active and willing to involve students in family life
- Are empathetic and enjoy engaging with teenagers
