Thursday 12 September - Friday 20 September

All subjects will be offering an examination and students are expected to attend these.

Study leave is a privilege not a right, and therefore students have to earn the permission to have study leave. Students will be considered, case by case, based on their effort in class and their academic performance. Students will be told whether they qualify for study leave or not by Monday 2 September. A study leave pass will be issued, and parents of those students who have not earned a study leave pass will be contacted.
