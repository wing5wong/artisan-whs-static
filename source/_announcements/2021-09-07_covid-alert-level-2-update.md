Special Newsletter – Alert Level 2

Dear parents and caregivers,

I hope you and your family are well as we head towards the warmer weather and brighter flowers of the new spring season.

As we all know, it is wonderful news that all students in our region will be able to return to school on Thursday, 9 September – under full Alert Level 2 conditions and expectations. Students and staff will be looking forward to seeing one another again and it will be great for face-to-face learning and teaching to be able to resume so quickly after a reasonably brief period of distance learning.

As always, we follow all updated Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health public health guidelines regarding the most effective hygiene and cleaning practices within buildings and the wider school environment, maintaining physical spaces between people, and use of sanitisers in classrooms and common areas.

Please note that face coverings for teenagers and adults within schools have been officially recommended but are not compulsory at this present point in time.

All outside visitors to the school must sign in at the Main Reception/Administration area or at the Student Centre. There will continue to be full utilisation of the NZ Covid Tracer App as well as contact tracing registers.

Year 11 to Year 13 students will be aware that the NCEA and Scholarship examinations have now been pushed back to various times between Monday, 22 November to Tuesday, 14 December.

To assist our senior students further with their examination revision programmes, we have now moved our Senior School Examinations to the final seven days of this school term i.e. Thursday, 23 September to Friday, 1 October.

We are looking forward to seeing as many students as possible back at school from Thursday onwards.

Nga mihi nui,

Martin McAllen
