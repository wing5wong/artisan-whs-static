Tranzit have informed WHS about some bus cancellations, due to reduced staffing availability following the government advice this weekend on those who should stay home.

This is effective immediately, so these buses will not run on Monday: Turakina secondary, Kaiwhaiki, Waverley, Wylies bridge/Mangamahu, Ratana, Brunswick, Westmere.

Buses that are still running:
Maxwell/Waitotara and Fordell (but not the Wylies bridge/Mangamahu connection minibus).
