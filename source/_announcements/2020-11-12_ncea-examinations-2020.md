#### NCEA EXAMINATIONS 2020

**Monday 16 November - Wednesday 9 December**

A reminder from NZQA that School Examinations for Year 11 - Year 13 this year have added importance in the Covid 19 environment.

Should the November NCEA examinations be effected by a 'Lockdown', your school examination mark may well become your actual mark or 'Derived Grade' so please ensure you have a good study routine in place.

#### JUNIOR EXAMINATIONS

**Monday 16 November & Tuesday 17 November**

Our Junior examinations in English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies are scheduled for Monday 16 and Tuesday 17 November. Each examination is two hours in duration and there is a digital component involved in each, so students are expected to bring their devices well charged.

For these two days, we will be running an altered time schedule as follows:

Form time: 9.00 – 9.20am  
**Exam 1: 9.30 – 11.30am**  
Lunch: 11.30 – 12.30pm  
**Exam 2: 12.40 – 2.40pm**

Students may go home at 2.40pm.  
Buses will run at the normal times and the Library will be open until 4.30pm.
