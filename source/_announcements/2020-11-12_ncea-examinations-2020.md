Form time is at the usual time of 8.45am and this will be followed by House Assemblies which will focus on LIFE Diploma awards. These awards will finish at approximately 10.00am and the students will then assemble to get ready for prizegiving at 10.30am.

**The Junior Prizegiving starts at 11.00am in the School Hall.** We encourage parents to attend - please be seated by 10.50am - and do not forget to allow time to get from your car park, as parking will be at a premium. The ceremony usually finishes at 12.50pm and students are then issued with their final school reports in their form classes before being released. The reports will be e-mailed that day as well.

Please contact the School is you have any questions or concerns.

**Last day for the Junior School.**

#### NCEA EXAMINATIONS 2020

**Monday 16 November - Wednesday 9 December**

A reminder from NZQA that School Examinations for Year 11 - Year 13 this year have added importance in the Covid 19 environment.

Should the November NCEA examinations be effected by a 'Lockdown', your school examination mark may well become your actual mark or 'Derived Grade' so please ensure you have a good study routine in place.
