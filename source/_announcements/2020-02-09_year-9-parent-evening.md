**Please note that we have brought forward the date of the Year 9 parents evening to this Tuesday, 11 February.**

The Year 9 Parent Evening will be held in our School Hall and Library from 6.30pm - 8pm on Tuesday 11 February.

Our student leaders have been busy preparing information to share with you about 'LIFE' at Whanganui High School and we can answer any questions you may have. Your children are most welcome to come with you.

During the information session in the hall you will be given further details on the following topics:  

* Bring Your Own Technology - device use and expectations.  
* Use of Google Classroom (all classes use this - so we thought it useful if parents had more information and could see some examples).  
* LIFE awards for students (the recognition structure we use for positive behaviour and effort).  
* Kamar portal for parents (we will show you how you can access this and how you can see the notices and attendance details for your child).  
* Reporting (the format and timeframe for reports and feedback to parents).  
* Sports on offer (both summer and winter and major events such as Athletics Day on 20/2/20)

We anticipate that this session will be 30-40 minutes long and then we hope you will join us in the library for some light refreshments.  

We will set up 'help desks', so you can have a one-on-one chat with staff or ask any questions.  

All 4 house teams will be there Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua if you would like to speak directly with the staff regarding pastoral care, plus a sports and a technology support help desk.
