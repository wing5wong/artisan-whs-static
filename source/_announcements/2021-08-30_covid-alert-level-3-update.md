Special Newsletter – Alert Level 3

Dear parents and caregivers,

I hope everything is well with you and your family and that you have reached - for at least some of the time – a balance between the essential structure of day-to-day living and the creative flexibility possible in the world of imagination and learning.

Please email me at [principal@whs.ac.nz](principal@whs.ac.nz) if your daughter or son requires more support in any area. I will reply and, if necessary, pass your email onto another member of staff who may be able to help you further.

From 11:59pm, Tuesday, 31 August, our region is moving into Alert Level 3. Key points:


• In Alert Level 3, most students will continue to learn from home, however, we are open for students in Year 9 and Year 10 whose parents or caregivers need to go to work and there is no alternative person who can supervise them.  

• Year 11 to Year 13 students are legally required to stay learning from home.  

• From **9:00am, Wednesday, 1 September, to 2:30pm each school day** until the end of Alert Level 3, we will be open for a small number of Year 9 and Year 10 students to attend school and to be supervised only (not taught) in their online learning programme. Please note that all Alert Level 3 safety precautions will be followed.  

• I will be on site all day, our Property Manager will be on site all day, our Network Administration Manager will be on site for some of the time, and a very small team of teachers will be on site when – and if - required. The great majority of our staff will continue working from home on our distance learning programmes. Other staff members coming into school to carry out **essential work for our students** (putting together learning resources to drop off at home letter-boxes or home front doors; scanning work to send to students and so on) will come into school at individually set periods
of time and will always require prior approval from me – **this process will continue throughout all of Alert Level 3.**

If your daughter or son will attend school from **9:00am, Wednesday**, please note the following:

• Email me at principal@whs.ac.nz by **5:00pm, Tuesday, 31 August**, so that I have full confirmation of likely Year 9 and Year 10 student numbers.

• Ask your daughter or son to meet me outside the Deans’ House (specifically in the area between the bus bay and the school flagpole) by **9:00am promptly on Wednesday**.
 
• Students will need to be in full school uniform; have their Chromebooks for their individual online learning with their normal classroom teachers; have a water bottle (drinking fountains cannot be used during Alert Level 3); have appropriate healthy food and lunch.


• Students will be put into bubbles of no more than 10 students. Teachers and students are not allowed to move between bubbles i.e. once a student is in a bubble with other students, that is the bubble the students and teacher will stay in throughout all of Alert Level 3.



We greatly appreciate your ongoing support in these challenging times.



Nga mihi,  
Martin McAllen
