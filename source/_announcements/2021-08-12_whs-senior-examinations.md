All subjects will be offering an examination or time to complete portfolios/technology projects, and students are expected to attend these. Study leave is a privilege not a right, and therefore students have to earn the permission to have study leave. Students will be considered, case by case, based on their effort in class and their academic performance, and they will be told well in advance of examinations starting.
Parents of those students who have not earned study leave will be contacted.
