Dear parents/caregivers



I hope everything is well with you and your families as we continue with Alert Level 4. As I outlined on our main school Facebook page and on the main school website page on Wednesday, each Learning Area Faculty has their own individual Teaching and Learning Plan in action right now – each plan was based upon student/staff experiences and feedback regarding the most effective teaching and learning methods during the last lockdown.



Please continue checking my emails, our main school Facebook page and the main school website page for important updates as they occur over the next few days and weeks.

Later today Sean Anderson (our Network Administration Manager) will text message the parents and caregivers of the 129 students (approximately 9% of our school roll) who borrow digital devices from the school each school day to complete their normal Google Classroom learning activities. Sean will seek confirmation that the students still require a school digital device to complete their online class work at home - he will then provide relevant details regarding the contactless handover of the devices from the school library this coming Monday and Tuesday.



I have asked all House Form teachers to make email contact with you over the next two days. Please let us know as soon as possible if your children require support in any area. To email any member of staff please follow this format: (family name.first letter of first name)@whs.ac.nz – for example, if John Walker worked at Whanganui High School his email address would be: walker.j@whs.ac.nz
