Kia ora koutou katoa,

 

I hope you and your family are well and that Alert Level 4 is short in time.

 

I emailed all of our teaching and support staff on Tuesday night and our Whanganui High School Covid Response Learning Area Plans will now be put into action from Wednesday until at least Friday afternoon.  What this effectively means is that during the next three days your children will hear from their teachers across our nine Learning Areas:  Technology; Mathematics; Science; Performing & Visual Arts; Digital Technologies; Languages; Social Sciences; English; Physical Education & Health.

 

Based upon our student and staff experiences and feedback from the last lockdown period, each Learning Area Faculty has a Covid Response Teaching and Learning Plan that works best for students and teachers in their own individual subject area.

 

If Alert Level 4 progresses beyond 11:59pm Friday night for our region, I will send out further developments and updates on this page regarding contact from House Form Teachers, pastoral care and support available from our deans and counsellors, and our processes for the contactless handover of appropriate technology to students who borrow digital devices from the school.

 

I am very mindful that we do not want our students to be overwhelmed by immediate instant contact and school work expectations from six to eight subject teachers.  Most students will probably hear from three or four teachers today through Google Classroom or emails, and hear from a couple more teachers tomorrow and so on.

 

All the very best to you and your family over the next few days.

 

Nga mihi,

 

Martin McAllen
