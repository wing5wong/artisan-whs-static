title: PPTA Full Strike Action – Wednesday 20 August
is_emergency: false
date: 2025-08-20T10:35:00+12:00
subtitle: Unable to provide teaching instruction
---
PPTA members covered by the Secondary Teachers’ Collective Agreement are taking full nationwide strike action on Wednesday 20 August.  All union members at our school will be taking part in the full strike action.

As a result, we will be unable to provide normal teaching instruction during the strike so our school will officially be closed for instruction during Wednesday 20 August.

If making alternative arrangements for care is difficult, a small number of non-union teaching staff will be able to supervise students in our school library during normal school hours for students (8.45 am to 3.05 pm).
