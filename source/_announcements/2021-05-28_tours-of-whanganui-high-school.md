From 21 June to 9 July, we will be holding one morning tour and one afternoon tour during normal class lessons on most days of the week for students and family members looking to be a part of our school from 2022 onwards. A link to book tour sessions will be available online soon.

Prior to this we will take enrolment information and information about the tour dates out to contributing schools from Tuesday, 8 June.
