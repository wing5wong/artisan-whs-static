Covid-19 Alert Level 2

Following the Government's announcement last night of our move to Covid-19 Alert Level 2, we want to reassure you that the School has re-established the guidelines we put in place previously for Alert Level 2. 

Our School is open as usual, with the following expectations in place:

•	All students and staff who are unwell must stay at home. Our sick bay will not be available for students who become ill at school. These students will be asked to go home.  

•	Hand sanitizer is available throughout the school and both staff and students have been asked to follow good handwashing routines.  

•	There will be no assemblies and sensible social distancing will be maintained as best we can.

We encourage you to trace your movements using the NZ Covid Tracer app or something similar.

In the meantime, please remain calm. We will keep you informed in the event of any changes.

Kia kaha koutou.
