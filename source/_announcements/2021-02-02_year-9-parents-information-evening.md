**INFORMATION for WHANGANUI HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND FAMILIES**  

**Covid-19 Alert Level 2**  

Following the Government's announcement last night of our move to Covid-19 Alert Level 2,
we want to reassure you that the School has re-established the guidelines we put in place
previously for Alert Level 2.  

Our School is open as usual, with the following expectations in place:
* All students and staff who are unwell must stay at home. Our sick bay will not be
available for students who become ill at school. These students will be asked to go
home.
* Hand sanitizer is available throughout the school and both staff and students have
been asked to follow good handwashing routines.
* There will be no assemblies and sensible social distancing will be maintained as best
we can.  

We encourage you to trace your movements using the NZ Covid Tracer app or something
similar.  

In the meantime, please remain calm. We will keep you informed in the event of any
changes.  

Kia kaha koutou.
