SPECIAL NEWSLETTER - February 2021  

This special newsletter is just focusing on two specific areas: our movement into Alert Level 2 until at least 11:59 pm on Wednesday, 17 February; and important events for the rest of Term 1.  

I sent our Revised and Updated Alert Level 2 Safety Plan (2021) to all teaching and support staff members on Sunday evening. Key points for parents and students:  

* Whanganui High School is open as usual.  
* All students and staff who are unwell must stay at home.  
* Physical distancing measures will be maintained so that there is no breathing on or touching of each other.  
* Good hygiene and cleaning practices will be followed: regular hand-washing and drying; coughing or sneezing into one's own elbow; no spitting; keeping surfaces as clean as possible.  
* Accurate contact tracing registers will continue to be maintained as well as full utilisation of the NZ Covid Tracer app. All visitors to the school must sign in at the Main Reception or the Student Centre - no exceptions.  
* Hand sanitiser is available in every single classroom and common area in the school.   
* Relevant instructional signage is put up in public places throughout the school.  
* House Assemblies will be cancelled for at least all of this week.  
* The Year 9 Parents' Information Evening on Wednesday, 17 February has been postponed to **6.30 pm, Tuesday, 2 March**.  
* Inter-regional Professional Learning Development and class trips have been postponed until at least Thursday, 18 February.  

I greatly appreciate your support and will continue to keep you informed as quickly as possible regarding any significant developments. I attach for your information Important Term 1 dates.  

Kia kaha koutou

Principal
