**The Year 9 Parents Information evening has been postponed until further notice due to Level 2 restrictions.**


.



This is an excellent opportunity for parents to hear about the services the School provides and how to access information related to daughters and sons. For example; device use and google classroom, uniform, extra-curricular sport options, plus it will be a chance for parents to mingle with staff and other Year 9 parents.
