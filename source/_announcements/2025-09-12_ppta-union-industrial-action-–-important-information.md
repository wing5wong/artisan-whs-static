Partial Strikes – Rostering Home (Week 10, Term 3)

Between 15 September and 18 September 2025, there will be a series of partial strikes.  Each strike will be from 9.00 am to 3.15 pm.  During those times, PPTA members will not teach, instruct or supervise students in certain year levels but continue to teach all other students.  Teachers will also continue to do administrative work in the time that they would usually have been teaching students in the affected year levels.

This information is being shared with you now so that you have time to make appropriate arrangements in advance of next week’s partial strike actions.

Please do not send students in the year levels below to school on the rostered home day.

All students in all other year levels are expected at school as usual.

If the situation changes at any stage, I will update you with new details immediately.

Timing of year levels affected:

15 September 2025 – Years 12 and 13 (rostered home)

16 September – Year 11 (rostered home)

17 September – Year 10 (rostered home)

18 September – Year 9 (rostered home)
