## Literacy and Numeracy for NCEA

In order to pass any level of NCEA, students must achieve 60 credits PLUS 10 Literacy and 10 Numeracy credits. These 10 Literacy and 10 Numeracy credits are separate from the core 60-credit requirement for NCEA Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3. Think of them as the foundational skills necessary to access and succeed in the full NCEA qualification. Once you have the 10 Numeracy and 10 Literacy credits (Num/Lit), you never need to take the assessments again. They carry forward into Level 2 and Level 3. Simply put, without these Num/Lit credits, you cannot pass any level of NCEA no matter how many credits you have.

## How can students get Literacy and Numeracy?

Until the end of 2027, there are **two** ways students can achieve Literacy and Numeracy.

The first and less complicated way is to get Numeracy and Literacy through CAA (Common Assessment Activities) which are sometimes called the co-requisites. These assessments are taken from Year 10 onwards.

The second way to achieve Numeracy and Literacy is by achieving credits through a limited number of achievement standards. This is the back up route if students have not been successful in the CAA.
