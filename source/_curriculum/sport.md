## Sports Performance Pathway 2019

This programme will target a selected range of students and offer more advanced training and support that will allow them to reach the next level of their athletic performance and their associated team sport / support sport activity. 

The performance group will be limited to a maximum of 30 places initially and will be chosen in conjunction with sport staff and coaches. Participants will come from identified sports and activities that fit with the sport development pathway model and level one sport priorities.
