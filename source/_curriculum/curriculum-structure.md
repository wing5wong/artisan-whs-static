## Course Structure

Whanganui High School offers the following course structure:

*   Entry Level (Level E)                                       Year 9
*   Pre-NCEA  (Level 0)                                        Year 10                      
*   NCEA Level 1                                                   Year 11

## Subject Names

All subjects have been named with reference to NCEA.  Year 9 and 10 courses are labelled Entry and Pre-NCEA.

_(Using Drama as an example)_

*   Entry Level                                                         DRA**E**
*   Pre-NCEA                                                           DRA**0**            
*   NCEA Level 1                                                     DRA**1**
*   NCEA Level 2                                                     DRA**2**
*   NCEA Level 3                                                     DRA**3**

## Multilevel Courses

Students in Year 10 – 13 may study **any subject at any level**, as long as they meet the course entry requirements, and have gained approval from the Associate Principal. The timetable has been designed so that students are able to choose their subjects from any NCEA Level.  It is expected that students choose courses, which reflect their level of achievement rather than their age.

_Example: A Year 11 student may take MAO2, while a Year 13 student might decide to take ACC1._

## Course Pathways

Course pathways have been designed so that students can develop their interests right up to Year 13.

_Example:   A student who is interested in Art could plan the following course pathway:_

**Year 9        Year 10        Year 11        Year 12                Year 13**

ARTE         ART0            ART1           ARP2 + ARD2      ARP3 + ARD3                      

_In 2019, students may take a Year 11 semester course as part of their pathway._

## Course Specialisation

In general, students are encouraged to take a broad course in Year 9, 10 and 11, but may specialise more in Year 12 and 13.

_Example: A student might be very interested in Science.  They might choose the following science pathway:_

**Year 9         Year 10           Year 11            Year 12            Year 13**

SCIE             SCI0                SCG1                BIO2                 BIO3                                                          

                                            SCE1                CHE2                CHE3                                                        

                                            SCI1                 PHY2                PHY3                                                      

                                                                     ELE2                 ELE3

#### Vocational Pathways

![](http://c1940652.r52.cf0.rackcdn.com/55aef040ff2a7c4de100004a/Voc-Path.png)

Vocational Pathways provide new ways to achieve NCEA Level 2 – the foundation for success in further education and the world of work. The pathways help students see how their learning and achievement is valued in the ‘real world’ by aligning the NCEA Level 2 Assessment Standards including specific ‘sector-related’ standards with six industries:  
• Primary Industries  
• Services Industries  
• Social & Community Services  
• Manufacturing & Technology  
• Construction & Infrastructure  
• Creative Industries  
These six pathways represent ways to structure and achieve NCEA Level 2 by providing a more coherent framework for foundational vocational education; students can develop their own individual education plans, are better informed and able to make better choices to meet their goals.  
Government agencies, the industry training sector, secondary and tertiary representatives and industry and employer representatives worked together to develop the six Vocational Pathways for NCEA Level 2 as the foundation of the journey to employment. These groups are now in the process of developing pathways through qualifications achieved in NCEA Level 3 and beyond
