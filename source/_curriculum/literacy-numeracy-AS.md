## Literacy and Numeracy through Achievement Standards

Until the end of 2027 it is also possible to attain Literacy and Numeracy through some Achievement Standards, but the most efficient way is still through CAA. However an alternative pathway also exists for students to demonstrate these co-requisite skills through subjects if they have not been successful through CAA.

Students still need 60 credits plus the 10 Numeracy and 10 Literacy credits, but it is possible to get credits through a limited number of Achievement standards (also known as ‘tagged standards’). The link shows which subjects have Literacy or Numeracy credits tagged to them.For this reason, students who have not passed the CAA at the end of Year 10 will be placed into Mathematics and English classes with a focus on both CAA and  a reduced number of Achievement Standard credits. Students in Year 12 and Year 13 may be placed in a Level 1 class to ensure they can get their credits through subjects.

Students who use Achievement standard credits for Literacy and Numeracy will have to get more than the minimum of 60 credits. For example, If a student gets 5 literacy credits in History, and 5 Literacy credits in English, then those 10 credits cannot be used in the total of 60 because they are being used for Literacy. If a student gets 5 Numeracy credits in Geography and 5 Numeracy credits in Mathematics, then those 10 Numeracy credits cannot be counted as part of the 60 total.

It is not possible to mix and match between CAA and Achievement standards. Students must get all 10 credits in either the CAA or the Achievement standards.
