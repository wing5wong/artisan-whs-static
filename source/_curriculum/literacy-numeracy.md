## Literacy and Numeracy for NCEA

In order to pass any level of NCEA, students must achieve 60 credits PLUS 10 Literacy and 10 Numeracy credits. These 10 Literacy and 10 Numeracy credits are separate from the core 60-credit requirement for NCEA Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3. Think of them as the foundational skills necessary to access and succeed in the full NCEA qualification. Once you have the 10 Numeracy and 10 Literacy credits (Num/Lit), you never need to take the assessments again. They carry forward into Level 2 and Level 3. Simply put, without these Num/Lit credits, you cannot pass any level of NCEA no matter how many credits you have.

### How to achieve NCEA
- **Level One:** 60 Credits at any Level 1, 2, 3
- **Level 2:** 60 Credits at Level 2 and above
- **Level 3:** 60 Credits at Level 3
- **+10 Literacy or Te Reo Matatini credits and 10 Numeracy or Te Pāngarau credits**

## How can students get Literacy and Numeracy?

Until the end of 2027, there are **two** ways students can achieve Literacy and Numeracy.

The first and less complicated way is to get Numeracy and Literacy through CAA (Common Assessment Activities) which are sometimes called the co-requisites. These assessments are taken from Year 10 onwards.

The second way to achieve Numeracy and Literacy is by achieving credits through a limited number of achievement standards. This is the back up route if students have not been successful in the CAA.

## Common Assessment Activities (CAA) {#CAA}

### What is the NCEA Co-requisite?

The Literacy and Numeracy co-requisite (Common Assessment Activity - CAA) is the mandatory requirement for a student to be awarded any NCEA qualification (Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3).  
Students must pass three assessments: two for Literacy (Reading and Writing) and one for Numeracy.

### The Skills Assessed: Beyond the Classroom

The co-requisite standards (CAA) cover foundational skills, aiming for approximately Level 4/5 of The New Zealand Curriculum. This means students are expected to not only know the content but to apply it flexibly and confidently. The assessments are available in English and Te Reo.

#### Literacy Co-requisite (Reading & Writing) or Te Reo Matatini

Students are assessed on their ability to communicate and comprehend effectively across various contexts. Key skills include:
- **Reading (5 credits):** Making sense of written texts, reading critically for different purposes, and extracting ideas and information.
- **Writing (5 credits):** Communicating meaningful ideas, structuring texts clearly for different audiences, and using correct language conventions (like punctuation and spelling) to support understanding.

Unit Standards covered: US32403 and US32405.  
Te Reo Matatini unit standards: 32413 (Te Reo Torohū) and 32415 (Te Reo Whakaputa).

#### Numeracy Co-requisite or Pāngarau

This standard requires students to master Level 4 mathematics and statistics content and interweave these ideas with real-world problem-solving processes. Key skills include:
- **Problem Solving:** Fluently and flexibly solving problems using numbers, understanding their relative size, and interpreting the answer in context.
- **Understanding:** Working with mathematical relationships, using spatial properties and representations, and understanding location and navigation systems.
- **Data and Chance:** Using numbers and units for measurement with appropriate precision, and reasoning with statistics, data, and probability.

(Unit Standard covered: US32406; Pāngarau US32412)

### The Common Assessment Activity (CAA)

#### What Does it Mean?

The Common Assessment Activity (CAA) is the name given to the online, external assessments used to measure the Literacy and Numeracy co-requisite standards.  
These digital exams are organised and supervised by the school. They are how students demonstrate they have achieved these essential foundational skills.

[NZQA CAA Information Page](#)

#### Online Digital Exams

- The CAAs are delivered as online assessments sat at school.
- Students sit three separate CAAs: Numeracy, Literacy (Reading), and Literacy (Writing).
- Each assessment generally takes around 60 minutes, but students are not limited by time and can take as long as they need. Provisions are made for Special Assessment Conditions (SAC) where necessary.
- The CAAs are offered as unit standard exams twice during the academic year. In 2026, the CAA will be held on May 18, 19, 20 and September 16, 17, 18. ([PUT IN LINK TO SCHOOL CALENDAR HERE](#))

#### Grading for the CAA

- The only possible grades are **Achieved** or **Not Achieved**.
- There are no Merit or Excellence grades available.
- Achieving these standards does not count toward NCEA endorsements (Merit/Excellence).
- The school does not receive the test papers or direct feedback from NZQA. Feedback is private and sent directly to the student's NZQA Login page.

#### Resits and Alternative Pathways

There is no limit to the number of times a student can attempt the CAAs. If a student receives a Not Achieved grade, they will have subsequent opportunities to resit the assessment.

## Preparation and Support

### Our Schoolwide Approach to Literacy and Numeracy

Our commitment is to embed these essential skills across the entire curriculum, ensuring students see their relevance everywhere.

- **Integrated Learning:** Literacy and Numeracy are not limited to specific subjects. Teachers integrate these skills across all learning areas, from Science to Technology.
- **Explicit Teaching:** Year 9, 10, and 11 English and Mathematics programmes are explicitly structured with CAA tasks and preparation.
- **Targeted Support:** Data on student progress is shared across subjects, allowing staff to identify and support students who may need extra help.

### What does ‘readiness for the CAA’ mean?

We use diagnostic tools such as e-asTTle, the PATs (Progressive Achievement Tests in reading and mathematics), alongside teacher observation to assess readiness for the CAA.  
[e-asTTle Scores](#) correlate closely with NZ Curriculum levels. Students with an e-asTTle score of 4A and above at Year 10 are most likely to succeed at CAA.

## Preparing for the CAA Digital Exam Platform

This is a digital assessment. Students will be shown how to set up an NZQA account and will be issued with their National Student Number (NSN). Students must use their school password and email to create their accounts.

[Preparing for Digital Assessments](#)

These assessments also come with a built-in text-to-speech application called Polly, which reads the text aloud to students.

Students who do not have devices need to inform the Academic Dean as soon as possible.

Here is a [useful checklist](#) for all students taking digital exams.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### When will my child take the CAAs?

The Common Assessment Activities are offered as external unit standard exams twice during the academic year in May and September. The specific dates for Year 10 and other students are publicised in the school calendar. ([SCHOOL CALENDAR LINK](#))

#### Do the Literacy and Numeracy standards count towards NCEA Level 1 credits?

The 10 Literacy and 10 Numeracy credits are separate from the 60-credit requirement for NCEA Level 1. They do not count toward the 60 credits but are essential for NCEA qualification.

#### If my child gets 'Not Achieved', what happens next?

They will have future opportunities to demonstrate the standard. There is no maximum number of times a student can sit the CAAs.

#### Can students get Merit or Excellence?

No, the only grades are **Achieved** or **Not Achieved**.

#### Is there a time limit for the CAAs?

No, students have no time limit to complete the online assessment. Most students finish within two school periods.

#### How will I know what my child needs to work on if they get 'Not Achieved'?

Students receive individual, personalised feedback on their NZQA Login page. We encourage students to share this feedback with their teachers for targeted support.

#### Who should we talk to if we have questions?

Start with your child’s English or Mathematics teacher, or contact the Academic Dean.

## Literacy and Numeracy through Achievement Standards

Until the end of 2027, students can also attain Literacy and Numeracy through some Achievement Standards, although the most efficient way is still through CAA.

Students who do not pass the CAA at the end of Year 10 will be placed in Mathematics and English classes focused on both CAA and a reduced number of Achievement Standard credits.  
Students using Achievement Standards for Literacy and Numeracy will need more than the minimum 60 credits. For example, if a student gets 5 literacy credits in History and 5 in English, those credits cannot be used toward the 60-credit total.

It is not possible to mix and match between CAA and Achievement Standards. Students must get all 10 credits in either the CAA or the Achievement Standards.
