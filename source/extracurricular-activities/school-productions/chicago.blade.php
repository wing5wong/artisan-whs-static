        Chicago first opened on Broadway at the 46th Street Theatre
        in New York City on June 3, 1975. The production, directed
        and choreographed by Bob Fosse, ran for 936 performances.
        On Nov 14, 1996, a revival of the show opened on Broadway
        at the Richard Rodgers Theatre. It later transferred to
        Shubert Theatre, and then to the Ambassador Theatre,
        where, more than two decades later, it continues to run,
        logging nearly 10,000 performances
