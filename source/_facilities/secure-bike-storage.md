We have a secure bike storage facility located behind our G Block.

Students are to leave their bicycles in the bike cage. The bike cage is locked at **9am** and re-opened at **3pm**. Students that cycle to school must place their bikes **within** the cage and are encouraged to use a high-quality lock to secure their bike in place.

For extra security, we have a security camera fixed upon the bike cage area.

For safety, the students are asked not to ride their bikes within the school grounds, they need to walk with their bikes.

If access to the bike cage is needed during the school day, students can go to the Student Centre for this to be organised.

**The bike cage is locked permanently at 4.45pm**, any bikes left in there will remain there overnight, please collect your bike before this time.
