  The Visual Arts Department at Whanganui High School now boasts of a
  purpose-built arts facility which has been designed as a future proof
  environment. From the original staff room in the 1980’s the Visual Arts
  building has been completely redesigned to create a flow of workspaces that
  allow for a range of dynamic teaching experiences. Students no longer work in
  silo areas but move between a range of specialised teaching spaces to work on
  design/painting/or printmaking projects.

The Visual Arts Department at Whanganui High School now boasts of a purpose-built arts facility which has been designed as a future proof environment. From the original staff room in the 1980’s the Visual Arts building has been completely redesigned to create a flow of workspaces that allow for a range of dynamic teaching experiences. Students no longer work in silo areas but move between a range of specialised teaching spaces to work on design/painting/or printmaking projects.

A dedicated design space of 30 high end computers now allows for an integrated approach to both the digital and analogue aspects of design. This is helped with all computers using the Adobe suite and specific machines working with CorelDraw programmes. The print room houses two large bed etching and woodcut presses a dedicated silkscreen exposure unit and a vinyl cutter. An enclosed quite space houses an extensive collection of Art resource books where students move to gather additional resource material. The central hallway has been designed with gallery lighting where student and staff work can be showcased.

An Additional breakout room and two art rooms complete the package. The teacher resource area, where a large format printer is located acts as central hub where staff have ample room to prepare resources for teaching that with lundia roller shelving for all storage makes for a pleasant environment.  

All rooms have double glazing, well insulated with heat pumps to help regulate the ambient temperature within the classrooms.
