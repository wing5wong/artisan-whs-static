  The Learning Support Centre (LSC)  provides extra support for student in the
  mainstream, who are finding their subject work difficult due to a specific
  Learning difficult or a condition (eg Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Autism, Anxiety;
  physical disability etc). Senior students with a Learning line get extra time
  for completing their Internal assessments and keeping up to date with their
  classwork. This may include Special Assessment Condition (Sac) students who
  qualify for reader writer assistance.

This space is used for students who require reader/writer support for assessments.

It is also used by the RTLB service when meeting and working alongside students.

The Central Regional health school meet individual students in LSC when supporting them to return to school after short term medical events.

If a student requires some additional support for a subject, then a teacher aide may withdraw them from class and work with them in LSC.

LSC is a quiet learning space for independent work for senior students at various times of the year. This is arranged directly with HoD Learning support through the pastoral team.
