  We like to think of the library as the beating heart of the school – everyone
  is welcomed here. It’s a multicultural community space managed by two
  qualified librarians supported by a fantastic 25 strong student librarian
  team. In our role as ‘info coaches’, we librarians are forward thinking,
  relationship focused, open, flexible and friendly in our approach to both
  students and staff. Our aim is to enable students to be in charge of their own
  learning.

### Innovative Learning Environment

We like to think of the library as the beating heart of the school – everyone is welcomed here.

It’s a multicultural community space managed by two qualified librarians supported by a fantastic 25 strong student librarian team.

In our role as ‘info coaches’, we librarians are forward thinking, relationship focused, open, flexible and friendly in our approach to both students and staff. Our aim is to enable students to be in charge of their own learning.

### Interior Design

Inside the library, it’s light filled and newly renovated. The walls are lined with brightly coloured student artworks. Our newly arrived Chinese warrior statues guard the Chinese corner - This is a multimedia resource area that supports the school’s Confucius Classroom status. These varied local and international cultural pops of colour and texture help create a great space for working or relaxing amongst our large collection of modern and classic fiction and non- fiction.

### Digital Learning

It’s not just about books here at Whanganui High - we provide a seamless digital learning environment that can be accessed 24/7 via our website and students’ personalised Google Chrome accounts - Here you will find digital bookmarks linking students to our [library catalogue app](http://library.whs.ac.nz/) and the vast world of subscription database resources and reading for pleasure via our e-book platform. We issue digital equipment including Chromebooks and headphones, we help students with technical enquiries and also act as a triage unit for the IT support team who are conveniently situated upstairs on the mezzanine floor.

### Orientation Events and Speakers

The school library is multi-talented, it has wide-ranging uses. We manage the staff and student web portals and we’re a venue for visiting speakers, seminars, debates, and evening functions.  
We also house the silent study room for seniors.  
Several times a year we host orientation sessions to welcome our newly arrived Y9s and International students so they can find their feet and get to know fellow new arrivals and staff members in a warm and comfortable setting.

### Photographs and Video

The library office doubles as a mini studio where photos are snapped and ID cards are produced for students and staff. We also manage the school’s ClickView Library so students and staff can watch educational videos at home or at school. Each person has their own personalised age appropriate account.

### Homework Centre

Supervised by a teacher and librarian, the Homework centre is open from after school until 4.30 pm weekdays. It’s handy for students wanting to study alone or with a group of friends, or for those just waiting to be picked up after school. Closer to exam time the library hosts a series of tutorials for seniors during Homework Centre and in the evenings.
