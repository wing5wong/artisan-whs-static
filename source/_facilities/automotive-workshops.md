The Automotive Engineering workshop is well resourced and respected in the community and wider regions. We have a dedicated technician, a stand-alone garage, teaching props that include running petrol and diesel engines, a set of engines for dismantling and reassembling, excellent tooling and running vehicles that include two petrol cars and a diesel ute to work on. A new triple garage near completion that will house a hoist, allowing us to further the learning opportunities of our students and keep up with the times in a rapidly moving work environment. The school recognises the need for tradespeople in the community, fosters work place relationships and sees the Whanganui High School Automotive course as a proven point of difference.
