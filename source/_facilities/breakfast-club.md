No breakfast? No energy to learn? We can fix that!


Research has shown that eating a healthy breakfast before starting the school day is linked to improved concentration, better test scores, increased energy, a higher intake of vitamins and minerals, and even a healthier body weight. Breakfast is especially important for younger students whose brains use up about half of the body's energy.


So, we are delighted to say ‘The Breakfast Stop’ is going from strength to strength this year with an almost new team of volunteer Peer Mentors and continued support from St John’s Four Square, KidsCan and Kickstart. The most exciting news is that hot food has now been added to the menu, with the opportunity for students to have beans on toast or eggs on toast, not just the Weetbix and toast which have previously been offered. This is a valuable addition to the menu as the colder months approach.



The Breakfast Stop is open daily from 8-00am until 8.30am.
