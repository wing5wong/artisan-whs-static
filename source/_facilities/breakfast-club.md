A recent survey by our Year 13 students, highlighted that 42% of students who responded either never or rarely had breakfast. This was for a variety of reasons, but included lack of time. Whanganui High School’s Breakfast Club was established during Term 3 this year to fulfil this need. This initiative is provided with the help of the charity KickStart Breakfast, which is a community partnership between Fonterra, Sanitarium and the New Zealand Government. It is run by the school’s Peer Mentor team, under the guidance of teacher Mrs Gail Glaister and Mrs Linda Hardcastle. 

Our Peer Mentor team set up the breakfast but also play games, and chat with any student who comes along. There is an open-door policy and all students are welcome. It runs every school day from 8.00am until 8.30am in the school’s cooking room. Students are welcome to help themselves to Weet-Bix and milk. The Breakfast Club is hoping to expand to other food items such as toast, butter and spreads in the near future.
Research shows that breakfast is important for brain and metabolic functions and concentration, so providing breakfast for our students gives them a ‘kick-start’ to their school day.
