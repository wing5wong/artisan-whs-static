**Wooden Lockers** **(B, F and G Block)**

Wooden lockers are free to use, you need to supply your own padlock AND fill in a form for the Student Centre, with the number of the locker you have choosen.

**Conditions of Use:**

* The lockers are also subject to reasonable terms of use and, being the property of the school, may be accessed by staff if there is reasonable cause to do so.
* Lockers are for the use of students, during the school year, to temporarily store items required for school. This would include things like books, sports gear and lunch items. They must not be used to store anything that students are not permitted to have at school. For example, anything flammable, alcohol, drugs or anything that might be considered a weapon. Storage of anything valuable is discouraged as such items can be left in a secure area in the Student Centre.
* Lockers are used on an “at your own risk” basis and the school cannot accept any responsibility for items which are damaged or go missing from a locker.
* Lockers must be used within the terms and conditions specified by the school.
