Whanganui High School has three gymnasiums plus a weights/fitness area. The biggest gym is the Te Wehi Gymnasium. It has a full size netball and basketball court in it. The Te Mana Gymnasium has a full-size basketball and volleyball court, whilst our smaller Gymnasium – the Te Ihi has a half court.

Upstairs in the Te Wehi Gymnasium we have a weights and fitness area. Students are able to use equipment such as a spin bike, rowing machines, cross trainers, treadmills, free and fixed weights. An instructor is available before and after school to help students with fitness and strengthening programmes.

In 2015 we opened our newest sporting facility – an all purpose weather turf. There are five netball courts, a half hockey field and seven tennis courts. This turf is used by our Physical Education classes as well as our sporting teams.

We also have a large grass area which allows us to have two Rugby and two Football fields for our winter sports teams. We also have two artificial cricket turfs and cricket batting nets.

During the summer the fields are marked for Touch and Athletics. There is also a new long jump pit.
