Our students come from a variety of countries including Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil, Pacific Islands, Germany, Italy, France, Finland, Norway and the Peoples Republic of China.\r\n\nInternational students select Whanganui High School for their education when they want to be away from the distractions of the big cities and concentrate on learning English and studying to qualify for university. Whanganui High School limits the number of students from any one country so that students can have more opportunities to speak English.\r\n\nAll our international students are placed in homestays (which have been visited and assessed by Whanganui High School in advance), as this means they are speaking English all day and they have parents to look after them and care for them. The international student becomes a member of the family.\r\n\r\nThe homestay fees cover all food and living expenses. Each student has their own bedroom and there are no other students in the same homestay who speak the same language.\r\n\nWhanganui High School's ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) programme prepares students for the IELTS examinations so they qualify for entry into any university."
