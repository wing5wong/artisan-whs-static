intro: In Mathematics and Statistics, students explore relationships in
  quantities, space, and data and learn to express these relationships in ways
  that help them to make sense of the world around them.

Whanganui High School offers a range of Mathematics courses designed to suit the needs of students with different interests and mathematical abilities.

In Years 9,10 and 11 students study a range of Mathematical topics: Algebra, Graphs, Statistics, Probability, Measurement and Geometry. The IGCSE Cambridge mathematics course is available for students in Year 11.

Students can begin specialising with Pure Mathematics or Statistical courses from Year 12. Cambridge Mathematics continues with AS and A level courses available.

**What Do We offer?**

Mathematics is the exploration and use of patterns and relationships in quantities, space, and time. Statistics is the exploration and use of patterns and relationships in data. These two disciplines are related but different ways of thinking and of solving problems. Both equip students with effective means for investigating, interpreting, explaining, and making sense of the world in which they live.

Mathematicians and statisticians use symbols, graphs, and diagrams to help them find and communicate patterns and relationships, and they create models to represent both real-life and hypothetical situations.



**Why study mathematics and statistics?**

By studying mathematics and statistics, students develop the ability to think creatively, critically, strategically, and logically. They learn to structure and to organise, to carry out procedures flexibly and accurately, to process and communicate information, and to enjoy intellectual challenge.

By learning mathematics and statistics, students develop other important thinking skills. They learn to create models and predict outcomes, to conjecture, to justify and verify, and to seek patterns and generalisations. They learn to estimate with reasonableness, calculate with precision, and understand when results are precise and when they must be interpreted with uncertainty. Mathematics and statistics have a broad range of practical applications in everyday life, in other learning areas, and in workplaces

**Learning area structure**

The achievement objectives are presented in three strands. It is important that students can see and make sense of the many connections within and across these strands.

**Number and algebra** – Number involves calculating and estimating, using appropriate mental, written, or machine calculation methods in flexible ways. It also involves knowing when it is appropriate to use estimation and being able to discern whether results are reasonable. Algebra involves generalising and representing the patterns and relationships found in numbers, shapes, and measures.

**Geometry and measurement** – Geometry involves recognising and using the properties and symmetries of shapes and describing position and movement. Measurement involves quantifying the attributes of objects, using appropriate units and instruments. It also involves predicting and calculating rates of change.

**Statistics** involves identifying problems that can be explored by the use of appropriate data, designing investigations, collecting data, exploring and using patterns and relationships in data, solving problems, and communicating findings. Statistics also involves interpreting statistical information, evaluating data-based arguments, and dealing with uncertainty and variation.



**What is Cambridge Mathematics?**

The curriculum is administered by University of Cambridge International examinations and is based on the British secondary syllabus, being adapted for schools internationally. Cambridge International Examinations (or CIE) is a provider of international qualifications, offering examinations in more than 160 countries.

**IGCSE** – The International General Certificate of Secondary Education. For Year 11 students. Assessed by examination. Mathematical level of IGCSE is between NCEA Level 1 and 2.

**AS level** – Advanced Subsidiary. This is a qualification for Year 12 students. AS results may be used to contribute to A Level. Assessed by examination.

Mathematical level of Cambridge AS is between NCEA Level 2 and 3.

**A level** – Advanced Level. Recognised as University Entrance internationally. The finishing qualification for secondary students. Assessed by examination.

Mathematical level of Cambridge A level is in advance of NCEA level 3 and often similar to NCEA scholarship.
