A squad of 10 young Whanganui artistic skaters are off to the NZ Artistic Roller Sports Championships in New Plymouth next month, and hopes are high they&rsquo;ll bag some prizes and titles.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Each girl will be competing in different events, from figures, dance and freeskate,&rdquo; says mum, volunteer helper and treasurer of Artistic, Stephanie Rush. Artistic is a sub-section of Wanganui Roller Sports Inc. In last year&rsquo;s Artistic Nationals the girls competed as a team in a show skate, but this year training has been concentrated on individual disciplines. In 2018 Pippa McKee got a first in the Primary Girls&rsquo; Creative Solo Dance and picked up good placings in three other events. She has earned a place on the club wall of fame.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all got potential for medals. It just depends on who they&rsquo;re competing against on the day and how well they perform. The Nationals are held every year in different venues. They were held in Whanganui last year, which was handy for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The venue was Jubilee Stadium, which is where the girls practise, as well as at their HQ at the skating rink in Hatrick St. Practice is at least three times a week and they fundraise to pay for the stadium. NZ Community Trust helps out with some funding. Costumes and skates are provided by parents, with different skates required for different disciplines.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The squad is currently all girls, which imposes artistic limits.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;The girls are desperate for some bloke partners,&rdquo; says Stephanie, &ldquo;They could do pairs then. If any boys are interested . . . ?&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The squad has a stable membership, with 16-year-old <strong>Callista Booth-Richards</strong> the longest serving, but the girls have built strong skating relationships with each other. Ages range from 10 to 16.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Chairperson Brenda Gunn acknowledges the work coach Hannah Smith has done over the past six years.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;She has shared her passion with the girls and has spent an amazing amount of time, training and supporting them at their competition and their skating journey over the years. Sadly Hannah resigned from her position this year and we wish her all the best with her work and social life, which she has had to sacrifice for her skating girls. True dedication! Coach Kylie Shirley from Palmerston North has filled this void. All of our competitive skaters now travel over to Palmerston North for coaching and we try to get Kylie to come to Whanganui as much as possible.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;This has lead to some discussions about how we can continue to support our very talented girls and their quest to be the best.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Another big thanks to all the volunteers who host the parties, public sessions, those who open up each day for training, committee participation, booking officers, all who help with first aid, encourage our skaters each day and the way we all contribute to making this little team a success. We have so much to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
