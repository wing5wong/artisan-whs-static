**Congratulations to Imogen Maguire and Rose Hird being selected for the Whanganui Walls mentoring programme.** 

A shame they couldn't create a wall in our community this year, however, here's a new opportunity from Whanganui Walls to get creative... 👩‍🎨 🎨 👨‍🎨

April 21  
Registation now open!  
Are you an artist, anywhere in the world, concerned about the state of our home planet and humanity?

This week, we announced a global call for artists to participate in “HOME”, the world’s first stay-at-home environmental mural festival.

From April 21-26, and in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day (April 22), we are mounting a globe-spanning campaign to unite creatives around a common cause; giving our HOME planet an artistic voice by painting murals in the safety of their home, while sheltering in place due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We are asking artists to create original artworks that make a statement about humanity’s relationship to the natural environment as it relates to COVID-19 and beyond. Because, now, more than ever, it is clear that environmental and human health are inseparable.

To register as a participating artist or learn about the project’s virtual event schedule, visit bit.ly/home-murals or hit the link in our bio.

Sign up today, share with your community, and be part of a global movement for a better tomorrow. Together, we will transform drab white walls at home into visionary canvases for a brighter future.
