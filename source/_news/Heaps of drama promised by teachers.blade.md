<p><strong>GLOBE TROTTING: <span>Whanganui High School student Vincent Collins is fundraising to travel to the Globe in London in July.</span></strong></p>
<p>There will be high drama when four teachers take the stage at an improv night at Whanganui Repertory.</p>
<p>And it's all in aid of getting Whanganui High School student Vincent Collins to the Globe in London in July.</p>
<p>Drama teachers Paul Collins from Whanganui Girls' College, Colin Hedivan and Bridget Rison from High School, and Sophie Ruth from Cullinane College will take the stage together for the improv night on March 10.</p>
<p>The four teachers will spend the evening improvising Shakespeare under the direction of Vincent and former High School student Millie Manning.</p>
<p>Year 13 student Vincent has been selected as part of the Young Shakespeare Company NZ to work with experts at the Globe, the replica of the outdoor theatre where Shakespeare's plays were performed.</p>
<p>"My dad is a drama teacher, and I am currently working with Mr Hedivan at school on the upcoming school musical, so I thought why not try" Vincent said of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Teachers improvising should be novel.</p>
<p>"Usually we get the students to improvise", said Paul.</p>
<p>"But we will have to try and work together to come up with some clever ideas based on what they come up with. Apparently Vincent and Millie are even using ideas from the audience."</p>
<p>Vincent said he was grateful to the Repertory Theatre for the use of their theatre, free of charge.</p>
<p>Tickets for the evening of improv are $10 and available at the door as well as by emailing vincent.collins.ysc@gmail.com. The show starts at 7pm.</p>
