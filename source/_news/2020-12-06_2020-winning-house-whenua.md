In 2020, Whenua House excelled through the hardships of Covid-19, achieving a lot of success despite the circumstances. As leaders, we felt  pressure to continue our winning form from 2019. There was an expectation on us to pull through again and we believe we fulfilled this. 2020 was full of smiles, team spirit, and first places for the Green Team. The goal that we outlined at the first house assembly of the year was 100% participation. We wanted to get as many people involved as we could to see our house represented with pride. With a goal focused on having fun and making the most of the year's house events, we obtained more success than we expected. 

Swimming Sports was our first event on the school calendar. We had many talented swimmers amongst our team who excelled throughout the day. It was great to see our non-swimmers giving it a go and getting involved. We were delighted to come out on top for our very first competition of the year. 

Athletics was our next challenge. It is the most competitive event of the year, with the whole school participating. Once again, Whenua proved to be the best house on the day, as we won both participation and competitive events. We had a great mixture of talented runners and non-runners competing throughout the day. There was a great atmosphere and our confidence grew as a house. Cross country was our next house competition. Whenua continued to step up to the challenge and we secured our third win of the year. The weather didn’t knock our spirits, as we continued to persevere through the foul conditions. Overall, the day was enjoyable and highlighted the extent of Whenua’s sporting talent. The final event of the year proved our versatility as a house. We outclassed the other houses to reveal Whenua can achieve in not only sporting events, but in academic events also, by winning the House Quiz. 

We are thrilled to have obtained the house shield back to back this year. We are beyond proud of our fellow Whenua students who worked hard throughout the year to earn us the points to secure the title. It was a privilege to lead a fantastic bunch of kids that made our final year at Whanganui High School a memorable one. This year was a tough year with covid and we are both elevated that we had such hardworking and determined students in our house. Due to our amazing house chants and house spirit, we had more participants in green getting involved in the events against the other houses. As a result of this, we were once again the best house at Whanganui High School!!
