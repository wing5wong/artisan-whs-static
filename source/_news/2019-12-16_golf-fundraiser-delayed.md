Golf: The epic 101 hole golfing fundraiser by three Whanganui players has been postponed until Sunday, December 22. Castlecliff Golf Club manager/professional Rodney Donaldson had roped in younger brothers Jack, 18, and Ryan, 16, to help fundraise to buy a defibrillator for the club. However, heavy rain last Sunday forced the club to move its Xmas Hamper Tournament out a week to this coming sabbath therefore also moving the 101 Holes day back a week.
