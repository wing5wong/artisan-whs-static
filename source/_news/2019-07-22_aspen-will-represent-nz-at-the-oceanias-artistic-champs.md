We are very excited to officially announce that **Aspen Fell** has been selected by international judges, at the Artistic Roller Skating Championships in New Plymouth over the holidays to **represent New Zealand at the Oceanias Artistic Championships 2019**, held in Melbourne in October.

Aspen, who skates for Manawatu Artistic Roller Skating Club, will be competing in the Junior International Dance section and will be doing two routines, a Free Dance and a Style dance.

Aspen has worked tirelessly to meet the criteria, deciding to go from a National grade to a much more competitive International Dance grade, four grades higher since competing last year.  In addition, Aspen has achieved 6 dance medal tests, five of which have been achieved in the last 15 months, which we believe is a record within itself.  We are unaware of any other artistic roller skater within New Zealand, who has accelerated to this international level, over less than a two year period.

Fantastic work Aspen, what an achievement!!
