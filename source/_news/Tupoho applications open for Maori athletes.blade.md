<p>A helping hand for the next generation of promising athletes from Whanganui Iwi is open again with Tupoho Whānau Trust opening nominations for their 2016/2017 sports scholarships.</p>
<p>First created in 2013, the Tupoho scholarships are to "provide support to rangatahi in the pursuit of their national and international sporting aspirations and careers".</p>
<p>They are given out to four recipients every year - so far 12 athletes of Whanganui Iwi descent have received the scholarship, covering a variety of sports from rugby and basketball to snow boarding and waka ama.</p>
<p>The Tupoho trust has partnered with Sport Whanganui and Inspire Whanganui trust to increase the access to sports support services.</p>
<p>Therefore, this year the Tupoho Sports Scholarship recipients will receive a $500 cash grant, a six month gym membership at Inspire Health &amp; Fitness, and membership to the regional Promising Athletes Programme (PAP).</p>
<p>Sport Whanganui run PAP locally - helping condition young athletes aged between 15-18 years and their coaches.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the scholarship, applicants must be aged 15-20 and descendants of Whanganui Iwi, mai i te Kāhui Maunga ki Tangaroa.</p>
<p>Previous recipients can reapply.</p>
<p>Selection will be based on the recipient's level of achievement in their code and the commitment they show to achieving their goals.</p>
<p>The Scholarship recipients will be presented at the Ray White Whanganui Sports Awards on November 18 at the Whanganui Racecourse.</p>
<p>Applications must be completed by 5pm on Thursday, November 10.</p>
