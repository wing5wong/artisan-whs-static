<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XV will tackle Eketahuna-Bush on Saturday in its first home game of the Manawatu Colts division competition.</p>
<p>Last weekend was to have been WHS' first home game until flooding in the city washed out any chance of the game against Dannevirke going ahead.</p>
<p>WHS deputy principal Chris Friedel said the fields were simply too waterlogged.</p>
<p>"It was like Lake Wanganui High here on Saturday with not a blade of grass above water," Friedel said. "They cancelled games across all divisions of the Manawatu competition at the weekend including the Colts, so points have gone for that round completely. The competition will now just carry on - we're all in the same boat though.</p>
<p>"We even had to cancel our inter-school match against Upper Hutt on Tuesday and our next home will be against Eketahuna-Bush this Saturday. It will be an interesting match, with Eketahuna-Bush third in the competition, and us fourth."</p>
