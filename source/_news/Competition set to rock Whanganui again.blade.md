<p>Fourteen musical acts are set to compete at the Whanganui final of the 2017 Smokefreerockquest this weekend.</p>
<p>High school bands, duos and solos from Whanganui will play off for first and second place prizes and the opportunity to go into the judging pool for the coveted eight spots at the national finals in September.</p>
<p>Smokefreerockquest founder and director Pete Rainey said at this level some entrants are already showing the stand-out factor that could see them achieve music career success.</p>
<p>"It's fascinating for us to look back at success stories like Kimbra, Evermore and Broods where we could see the star factor right back at the regional level," Mr Rainey said.</p>
<p>"Saturday night's event gives a new cohort of bands the opportunity to take their obsession with music and develop the organisational and stage craft skills that will help them become another Kiwi music success."</p>
<p>Mr Rainey said this was Smokefreerockquest's 28th year.</p>
<p>Its past winners have included acts that have gone on to international fame, including Kimbra, Evermore, Ladyhawke, Anika Moa, Kora, Brooke Fraser, Phoenix Foundation, Bic Runga, and many more.</p>
<p>Two bands and two solos/duos will be selected from each regional final to go into the selection pool. Each group submits a 15-minute video of themselves playing, and from there a selection panel will choose the top six bands and two solos/duos. These eight will compete in the national final.</p>
<p><strong>The full line-up of bands and solo/duo acts is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brimstone - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>Paradox- Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>S!x - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>Chanpertional - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>Sleepy Teens Club - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>Straight Lace - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>JFD's - Whanganui High School</strong><br /><strong>Space Cactus - Whanganui High School</strong><br />etc, etc...- Ruapehu College<br />Ariana and Monika - Rangitikei College<br />Tia - Rangitikei College<br />Crystal-Lee &amp; Anastacia - Rangitikei College<br />Madie - Wanganui City College<br />Xavia - Ruapehu College</p>
