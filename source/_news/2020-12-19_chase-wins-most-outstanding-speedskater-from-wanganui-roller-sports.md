**Chase Morpeth was awarded the 2020 ‘Most Outstanding Speedskater’ trophy at the annual Wanganui Roller Skating Club prizegiving, Speed Section on Saturday 12 December.**

This was awarded for winning the 3km Flat Track Premier Men’s event in our annual River City Tour on 29 November.  There were some of New Zealand’s top senior male skaters in this race, as the Tour was a chance for them to check out our tracks before the New Zealand Roller Sports Speed Championships, which will be held in Wanganui from 29 December 2020 until 2 January 2021.

Fantastic effort Chase, especially with the calibre of skaters you were racing against. Well done!
