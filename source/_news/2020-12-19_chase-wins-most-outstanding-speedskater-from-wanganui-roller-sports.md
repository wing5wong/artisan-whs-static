Chase Morpeth was awarded the 2020 ‘Most Outstanding Speedskater’ trophy from the Wanganui Roller Sports Incorporated, Speed Section on 12/12/20.

This was awarded for winning the 3km Flat Track Premier Men’s event in our annual River City Tour on 29 November.  There were some of New Zealand’s top senior male skaters in this race, as the Tour was a chance for them to check out our tracks before the NZ Roller Sports Speed Championships, which will be held in Wanganui from 29 December 2020 until 2 January 2021.
