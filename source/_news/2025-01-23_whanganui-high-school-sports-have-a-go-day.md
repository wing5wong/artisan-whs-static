Great morning on Wednesday 22 January at WHS for our new Year 9 students able to attend our ‘have a go day’ with our Sports team. Lots of fun activities and touring around the [](<>)school. Big thanks to our amazing sports prefect team and Greg Fromont and his team of athletes for helping run the day!


We wish all our new students the very best for 2025!
