On Friday 31 July we held our annual House Quiz, where we saw 76 teams head over to the Jubilee Studium for the afternoon to rack their brains with some classic trivia.

It was an amazing day with many great moments.

The Quiz was run by the Academic Prefects, emceed by House Captains, and marked by the rest of the Prefect Team.

Congratulations to 'Foot', winners of the Quiz, and contributing to Whenua winning overall.

Woohoo! .. WHENUA takes out HOUSE QUIZ 2020!!
