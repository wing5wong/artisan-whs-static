After a two year break, Whanganui High School is pleased to announce their production of **MAMMA MIA** coming to the Royal Wanganui Opera House this May.

#### Students are invited to audition next week.

**22/2/21 MONDAY FIRST BREAK** ~ we will be teaching the Dance Audition in the School Hall.

**23/2/21 TUESDAY 3.30pm - 5.30pm** ~ Auditions begin for all cast members. You will need to complete a short Dance, Vocal and Acting audition if you wish to be considered for a lead role.

You will need to:  

1. Perform the dance you learned on Monday.
2. Perform a scene from the [Audition Scripts](https://mtow.org/attachments/article/278/Mamma%20Mia%20Audition%20Scenes.pdf) (please familiarize yourself with them on your device, we will provide you with a hard copy at the audition)
3. Sing a song of your choice, ideally to a track (YouTube/Spotify) or you can accompany yourself.

**24/2/21 WEDNESDAY 3.30pm - 5.30pm** ~ Catch ups for those who are unable to audition on Tuesday. You will need to book a time from [Miss Armstrong](armstrong.r@whs.ac.nz<armstrong.r@whs.ac.nz>;) if you want to audition Wednesday. Some callbacks may also happen on this day.

**25/2/21 THURSDAY** ~ People who receive callbacks will be notified by email and will need to prepare a song from the show (we may assign you one).
