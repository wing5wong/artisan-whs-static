<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Review by Liz Wylie</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">If the brief was to take a burly bloke in drag with a thoroughly despicable character and make him lovable, Wanganui Repertory have nailed it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Phil Hudson's portrayal of the self-serving Petunia Whittington in&nbsp;<em>Dick Whittington and his Cat</em>&nbsp;is a triumph and the entire cast provides a perfect foil for the wicked widow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Credit must also go to the wardrobe team - <strong>Linda Hardcastle</strong> and Rosalind Reese for Petunia's polka dot pantaloons and cute sailor suit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Roger Hall's adaptation of the classic tale is already humorous and these Whanganui actors delivered some local gags that made it even funnier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chris McKenzie should be gratified with his first stint as director and the cast did him proud.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Young lovers Dick (<strong>Heath McKenzie</strong>) and Alice (<strong>Charlee Elgar</strong>) won the hearts of the audience and <strong>Isabelle McKenzie</strong> as Tom the Cat played her part with perfect feline grace and chicanery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As the audience warmed to Mrs Whittington they hissed and booed the villainous Jack Tar (Richard Leith) and his alter-egos King Rat, Art and Captain Tendor - all played brilliantly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">David Craig's portrayals of the sleaze ball Mayor of Hawera, the kind-hearted Fitzwarren and the altogether alarming Chief Bananarama were sensational.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ethel (Ashlyn Morris) and Cecil (<strong>Maddi McKenzie</strong>) were the perfect sidekick duo even if their opera singing attempts were atrocious.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Shontae Arthur played the piano beautifully throughout and musical director Kieran Callaghan led some of the singing with his very fine voice.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ian Jones played a great Bosun and Maia Hudson was an adorable kitten (You will need to go and see the play to find out where the kitten comes in).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Director McKenzie also cast <strong>Ronan Shaw&nbsp;</strong> <strong>and Tori Whibley</strong> as comedic stagehands which worked brilliantly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Everyone who worked front and back of house deserves hearty congratulations and it is a production guaranteed to make you happy.</p>
