<p>Country Caf&eacute; &amp; Playground &ndash; to open soon</p>

<p>The Country Caf&eacute; &amp; Playground on London Street, where St Johns Greenworld once was, is opening soon - at least the caf&eacute; and the inside area for &lsquo;Mums &amp; Bubs.&rsquo; The outdoor playground area is still being constructed but Michaela Carr, one of the two directors, says &ldquo;the wait will be well worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Michaela&rsquo;s idea to develop a combined caf&eacute; and playground centre for Whanganui. Currently many parents/grandparents take the kids acr<span class="text_exposed_show">oss to Palmerston North to places such as Lollipops. Having the Country Caf&eacute; &amp; Playland in Whanganui will save them time and the expense.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Michaela has taught in early childhood centres for 10 years and has a degree in Early Childhood Development, so has a good knowledge of what not only appeals to kids but also what is developmentally and educationally beneficial. The outdoor playground is divided into areas for smaller and older kids, but the children will be free to move between the two areas at their parents&rsquo; discretion.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The playground equipment has all been custom designed and apart from astro turf and the slides, the country theme of wooden battens and strainer posts is evident throughout. The indoor area is for all children but will be most appreciated by little ones and of course the parents. The cost for children is only $2.50 a visit.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The complex will open from 6.30am to 5.30pm on Sundays through to Wednesdays and until 8pm from Thursdays through to Saturdays. The early start is both for anyone wanting to pick up a coffee and food on the way to work and also for parents who can have a coffee and breakfast, while the children enjoy themselves before school. It will also be a good option for the time between the end of the school day and dinner and possibly for play dates.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Apart from cabinet food, there will be a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu featuring &ldquo;delicious, seasoned items &ndash; something for everyone &ndash; and served without delay,&rdquo; says Michaela. These include steaks, burgers, pasta, salads and fish and all reasonably priced.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">There is a kids menu featuring low cost items that kids are likely to eat, such as marmite on toast and macaroni and cheese.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Michaela is already planning on other services such as kids&rsquo; birthday parties, family areas located under cover in themed areas and catered meetings in a separate function room.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Michaela&rsquo;s mother, Alison, is the other director and her father, Sam is her &ldquo;handyman superstar.&rdquo; She adds &ldquo;without my parents, none of this would have happened.&rdquo; When the centre is fully up and running 12 staff will be employed.</span></p>
