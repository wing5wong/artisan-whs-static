What did you do during lockdown? What was the experience like for you? How did you feel about it? Whanganui Learning Centre and Whanganui Regional Museum are working together on a project to record local people’s experience of the Covid-19 lockdown between 25 March and 13 May 2020.

The Whanganui Learning Centre is holding an exhibition of art, craft and stories based on the experiences people had in their “bubbles” during lockdown. Individuals, whānau, workmates and housemates are invited to design a bubble and to share the best and/or worst of their experiences through visual art or narrative. It is hoped that this project will record a unique time in history and capture a collection of these extraordinary moments and experiences.

Anyone in Whanganui can share their experience in any medium, including paint, print, poetry, written word, audio recording, video recording, sculpture, photography, music, collage, recipes, crochet, tatting, quilting, weaving or other crafts. Some people may have rekindled a previously lost skill, craft or art, and want to celebrate and share the learning. To maximise the number of bubble kōrero able to be displayed, there is a maximum size restriction of 50cm x 50cm.

The Whanganui Learning Centre will be open during the weekend of 12 and 13 September for anyone wanting a space to create their Bubble kōrero.

Entries for the Bubble Kōrero exhibition are being received now until Friday, 18 September. The final exhibition is opening to the public on 26 September.

For further information please contact Whanganui Learning Centre project coordinators, Jo Ockey or Simon Stubbs on 06 348 4950, email wlearning@gmail.com or call into the centre at 232 Wicksteed Street.
