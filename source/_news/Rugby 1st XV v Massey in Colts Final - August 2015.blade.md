<p>A review of the final's game from Stacey Ranginui (Assistant Manager). Thanks Stacey for your support for our boys this season!</p>
<p>It was a very quiet ride down to the game as the boys were fully concentrating on the game ahead.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">We got to the park at 11.45 and the boys were ready for the battle ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>WHS are showing a couple of nerves and Massey capitalise and score in the corner. Conversion unsuccessful. Score 5-0 Massey.</p>
<p>WHS show they are starting to shake the nerves and Sheldon Pakinga intercepted the ball and scored under the post. Conversion successful Mitchell Millar score 7-5 WHS.</p>
<p>A penalty against Massey saw WHS get an opportunity to kick for goal. Unsuccessful Penality by WHS. Score 7-5 WHS.</p>

<p>A big battle from both sides saw Massey attack and WHS defend for about 10 minutes. Massey finally score in the corner. Conversion unsuccessful. Score 21-19 Massey.</p>
<p>A penalty kick from Massey in the last minute saw Massey take the game 24-19. &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It was a great battle and it didn't come easy for Massey and they did have to work for it.</span></p>
