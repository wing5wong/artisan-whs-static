<p>Wanganui Balance Accountants Junior Motocross Academy riders placed well last Sunday in Foxton at the Goldcoast Motorcycle Club Wellington Motocross Championships.</p>
<p>The young riders handled the very demanding rough sand track with skill thanks to lessons learned since the Wanganui Motorcycle Club set up the academy earlier this year.</p>
<p>The youngsters were also fortunate to see nationally and internationally-ranked riders Courtney Duncan and Josh Coppins compete in the senior classes.</p>
<p>Best of the Wanganui junior academy contingent was in the junior 12-16 125cc class where James Rountree (YZ125) raced well to finish 4th overall, while WHS student <strong>Olly Dennison</strong> finished 5th in the junior 250cc 4-stroke class.</p>
<p>Other academy riders in the placings were: <strong>Jaxon Watt</strong>&nbsp;12-16 85cc finished 6th, Campbell Tylee 12-16 125cc 7th and Hunter Gilbertson 9th in the junior 250cc class.</p>
<p>The next event for the academy is the Taupo Motocross Festival over Labour Weekend where more than 200 riders will contest 15 different classes over 2 days.</p>
