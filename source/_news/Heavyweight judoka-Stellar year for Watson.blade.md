<h4>Whanganui judoka Keightley Watson has had an outstanding year.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui heavyweight judoka Keightley Watson topped off his stellar 2017 season with a silver in the senior men's 100kg+ category in Broadmeadows, Melbourne at the weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Watson was also named Junior Sportsman of the Year at The Hits Whanganui Secondary Schools Sports Awards 2017 on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With no heavyweight fighters in the Cadets or Junior men weight categories at the Melbourne competition it was always his intention to compete in the senior men plus 100kg division as a lead up to next season where he will be fighting in cadets, junior men and senior men's competitions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Unable to compete in seniors in New Zealand because of his age, this was an ideal opportunity for the 16-year-old to compete against the Australian No1 and No2 senior ranked heavyweights who were competing at the Melbourne competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While losing in the final against the No1, Watson pushed him right to the last 15 seconds of the 5-minute bout before being thrown and losing the fight, but he made him work for his win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was certainly no walk in the park for the Aussie who had about eight years on Keightley," father Ross Watson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"Prior to that he won the semi-final against the No2, another black belt and 30-year-old who weighed around 170kg, so was a big rig. That was a real confidence booster for Keightley next year."</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Taki Tame Judo Club from Melbourne also invited Watson to be part of their teams event consisting of different weight categories of three females and four males.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The teams event saw the club placed second, so two silver medals for young Watson at the MIJO 2017.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was also a 2-day training camp held after the competition which was a bonus under the guidance of Maria Pekli who is a two time Olympian and in addition he had 2x2-hour training sessions at Pekli's Melbourne Judo Club Resilience under her husband Daniel Kelly, a four-time Olympian who also had a successful MMA career after judo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So, it will now be back into the gym six days a week to build more strength and work on some cardio which he will need when fighting the heavyweight seniors in 5-minute fights.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 2018 season will start in January with the national training camp in the South Island then February in the ACT International open in Canberra, followed by Gold Coast in March before selection begins for the Oceania Judo Union event in New Caledonia in April.</p>
