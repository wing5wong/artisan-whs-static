<p>Anthonie Tonnon said The People provided the best first performance by a new band he had seen when he followed them on stage at the Royal Wanganui Opera House last Saturday night.</p>
<p>It certainly was a smashing debut for the nine-piece Whanganui band from the moment they hit the stage.</p>
<p>With three black-robed singers, a go-go girl in shocking pink, a bare-chested keyboard player and a guitarist wearing a jacket that would make Liberace blush, they had the audience's attention from the get go.</p>
<p>Their four-song set was impressively tight and well co-ordinated, largely thanks to drummer Georgie Ormond, who kept the beats just right.</p>
<p>The People's original songs sound like light-hearted ditties until you listen to the lyrics, which contain pyromanic threats and accusations of murder.</p>
<p>They were a delight to see and hear and a hard act to follow for solo artist Tonnon, who looked very much at home on the stage with his brilliantined hair and smart suit.</p>
<p>It didn't take him long to own the stage and win the approval of the audience with his smooth voice and catchy tunes.</p>
<p>Those catchy tunes have some very punchy lyrics - especially&nbsp;<em>Water Underground,</em>&nbsp;a tale of Nick Smith and Canterbury irrigation.</p>
<p>Rumour has it Tonnon plans to make Whanganui his home base, and if the audience response to his music and dance moves are anything to go by, he will be warmly welcomed.</p>
<p>There was no onstage dancing from headliners The Chills, although drummer Todd Knudson appeared to be having trouble keeping his seat at times.</p>
<p>He is a great engine for this Dunedin band, founded by Martin Phillipps back in 1980 and still delivering a unique sound that never seems to get old.</p>
<p>Sadly, the band was missing keyboard and violin player Erica Scally, who recently had a baby.</p>
<p>Audience members were calling for the band to play the 1986 hit&nbsp;<em>I Love My Leather Jacket</em>&nbsp;and they delivered a version that got the crowd on their feet.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoyed hearing songs from the 2015&nbsp;<em>Silver Bullets</em>&nbsp;album played live for the first time and my old favourites&nbsp;<em>Rolling Moon</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Kaleidoscope World</em>&nbsp;sounded beautiful in the opera house.</p>
<p>Phillipps' voice is deeper with a touch of world-weariness to it these days, but his songs are like loved children - grown up now but as dear as they ever were.</p>
