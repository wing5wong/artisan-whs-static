<p>What skills and attributes do you think the ideal Whanganui High School graduate should have?</p>
<p>That's the question the school's board of trustees and senior management put to a group of local business owners at a forum at the school last Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Representatives from 23 Whanganui businesses and organisations attended the meeting - everything from charitable organisations to local councils to law firms, trade businesses and retail stores.</p>
<p>The forum was the latest in a series of consultations the school has had with stakeholder groups as they seek to discover the ideal Whanganui High School graduate.</p>
<p>"Obviously academic excellence is important - this is a school, after all - but we also want to find out what attitudes and values people think our graduates should have as part of the Whanganui community," board of trustee member Jo Maguire said.</p>
<p>The school has asked parents, staff, local iwi and even the students themselves for their views on the graduate profile.</p>
<p>"It's great to have so many different parties involved. We had nearly 400 responses from parents, which we were very pleased about," Mrs Maguire said.</p>
<p>"And we had so many responses from the businesses - they were very enthusiastic."</p>
<p>The project was started by the board of trustees in 2016, but principal Martin McAllen, who started at the school at the beginning of 2017, has embraced it with enthusiasm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He said the graduate profile project was running alongside another project to look at the school's curriculum.</p>
<p>"The school's senior leadership is looking at what changes we might make for 2018. We want to have the most relevant curriculum for our students," Mr McAllen said.</p>
<p>"It's very timely - it's quite a while since changes were made to the curriculum."</p>
<p>The curriculum project is very in-depth, looking into such details as whether the current timetabling works well.</p>
<p>Mr McAllen said the next phase in the graduate profile project was to collate all the responses and come up with the attributes and skills of an ideal graduate.</p>
<p>"Sixty per cent of Whanganui's teenagers come to Whanganui High School. So if we get it right, it will benefit Whanganui as a whole," he said.</p>
