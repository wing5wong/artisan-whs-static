Jono Nixon and Jacob Hiroti, who started with us approx two and a half years ago have finished their apprenticeships and are now Level 4 qualified Arborists based in our Wanganui branch. Congratulations guys!

We look forward to supporting and passing on the knowledge to our three new apprentices who are currently working on becoming qualified in the Manawatu!
