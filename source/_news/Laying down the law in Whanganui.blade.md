<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world.</strong></p>
<p>Small provincial towns over big city lights any day, says former Whanganui High School student Petra Allen.</p>
<p>In 2010, the 25-year-old left Whanganui to travel for a year, returning to New Zealand with "open eyes" and deciding she wanted to become a hot-shot lawyer.</p>
<p>Now five years later she is back in little old Whanganui with a law degree and a new job at law firm Treadwell Gordon.</p>
<p>One year into her graduate job, Miss Allen says choosing to work in a provincial town was the best decision she ever made.</p>
<p>"Working in the community I grew up in makes it easier to relate to people and issues I'm working with," she said.</p>
<p>"It helps find common ground and I think that's really essential to build trusting relationships."</p>
<p>Throughout secondary school, she kept her options open studying English, art history and all science subjects.</p>
<p>"Whanganui High School provided me with options and I was able to try a good range of subjects. I soon realised the sciences weren't for me.</p>
<p>"Truthfully I didn't know what I wanted to do, but I thought law gave me lots of options."</p>
<p>In New Zealand, a bachelor of law degree is a five-year study covering public law, commercial law, international law, common law and statute law.</p>
<p>In the first year students are required to take three law papers and five non-law papers. About 80 per cent of law students do a second, conjoint degree.</p>
<p>"Alongside my law degree I studied politics and international relations which gave me more flexibility to work out what I was really passionate about."</p>
<p>Miss Allen found her niche in general practice law.</p>
<p>"I enjoy being able to explain the law in a way clients can understand it ... often people get overwhelmed when it comes to things like buying a house and being able to make that process easier is hugely rewarding."</p>
<p>For students contemplating law, she recommends finding work experience as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid to put yourself out there. I approached so many different law firms and law professionals ... you should do it even if it is just for some advice."</p>
