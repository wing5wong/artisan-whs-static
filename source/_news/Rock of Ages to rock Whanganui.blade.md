<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">&lsquo;Rock of Ages&rsquo; is a musical built around classic rock songs from the 1980s, especially the famous glam mental bands of that decade. It ran on Broadway for over 2,300 performances, finishing in January 2015. Soon after they developed a High School version and according to Colin Hedivan, Head of Performing Arts at Whanganui High School, the forthcoming production by High School on May 10 to 13, will be the first one by a high school in New Zealand &ldquo;as far as I know.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">He says it will be popular with everyone. &ldquo;It exudes fun. You will love the music and will want to sing along. In fact you will be encouraged to sing along. It will be something different, a fantastic night.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">High School produces a musical every second year with previous recent productions being Annie, Crazy for You and Guys and Dolls. Colin says &ldquo;we invite year 8 students to come to a performing arts workshop at the end of the year. They get an idea of what to expect, meet senior students, teachers and get a feel of the place.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Early on in term one students are invited to audition. They sing a solo and do a dance audition and from that selected students are invited to come back and do a reading audition. &ldquo;A lot of students want to get into the production,&rdquo; says Colin and for Amazing Grace there will be a cast of 97, from year 9 to year 13, with &ldquo;the most year 9s at 21 than we have ever had,&rdquo; says Colin. There are 29 speaking roles.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Since then they have been rehearsing five evenings a week and will have three full days during the holidays. When River City Press turned up for the first holiday rehearsal, there was a huge crowd of students raring to go.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The band which will be on stage at the Royal Wanganui Opera House includes five adults (two music teachers and three musicians from the community). </span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">&ldquo;There is a loose story line,&rdquo; advises Colin. &ldquo;It is a love story between Drew and Sherrie played by two year 13 students James Rowe and Tegan Cox. There is also an omnipresent character Lonny who pops up everywhere and engages with the audience. &ldquo;Hugo Collins plays this flamboyant, energetic and demanding role,&rdquo; says Colin.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Tickets are $20 for adults, $15 for students, with a family ticket for two adults and two students at $60. They can be booked at the Royal Wanganui Opera House.</span></span></p>
