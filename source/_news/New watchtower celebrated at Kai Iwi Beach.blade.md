<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui surf life saver Glen Collins said conditions were perfect for the first day of patrols at Castlecliff and Kai Iwi beaches on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was also the first day of service for the new the surf lifeguard watch tower at Kai Iwi/Mowhanau beach and Mr Collins said it served its purpose well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was patrolling at Mowhanau on Saturday and we had the flags up with a receding tide.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The new tower is great.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had excellent communication with the patrol at Castlecliff and there were perfect conditions there as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lifeguard and builder Matthew Newell instigated the building of a watch tower at Mowhanau and did most of the work himself.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He approached sponsors including main sponsor Mitre 10 MEGA and lifeguards at Mowhanau will now have shelter from the wind and rain as well as the ability to communicate efficiently with their home base at Castlecliff.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Newell got to cut the ribbon at the opening of the new tower on Saturday which was celebrated with a sausage sizzle and drinks for gold coin donations with proceeds going to the Wanganui Lifeguard Services.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui surf life savers will be patrolling both beaches throughout the summer and may continue beyond the end of February 2018 depending on the weather.</p>
