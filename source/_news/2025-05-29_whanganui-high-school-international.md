Cultural Connections in Hokkaido 

Last week, our three students on the Hokkaido Exchange, Jeide Tyrell, Jipsy Manuel-Joseph and Acacia Kingi Te Koari along with Whanganui Girls' College students Aurora Chernoff and Maria Melbourne, had the incredible opportunity to visit the Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park, dedicated to preserving and sharing the culture and history of the Ainu people‚ÄîIndigenous to Hokkaido, Japan. 

During the visit, students learned about Ainu traditions, the impact of colonisation, and the rich cultural heritage of Hokkaido. Many were struck by the parallels between Ainu and MƒÅori experiences, particularly around the themes of language loss, identity, and resilience.

A real highlight was getting to wear traditional Ainu clothing, taking part in Ainu games, and exploring the interactive exhibits that brought history to life in a meaningful way.

This Upopoy visit provoked reflection, connection, and a deeper understanding of Indigenous cultures across the world. üåøüåè

We would like to acknowledge Whanganui & Partners for making this exchange possible.
