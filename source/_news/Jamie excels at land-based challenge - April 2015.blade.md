<p><span>BRIGHT SPARK: Wanganui electrical apprentice and former WHS student Jamie Newell has won the regional heat in the annual Master's Electricians' Challenge.</span></p>
<p>Apprentice electrician Jamie Newell has been named Wanganui's top electrical services apprentice in theregional heats of the Master Electricians' Challenge.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old from Westmere was one of about 100 apprentices competing in regional heats around the country and the top 10 will go on to compete in the two-day final in Hamilton in May.</p>
<p>Jamie is currently working at Q-West boat builders in Castlecliff, where he is installing wiring in mono-hull, catamaran and tri hull boats.</p>
<p>"It's an area I love working in " I grew up around boats as my father owns a marine mechanic shop."</p>
<p>There were four wiring and testing challenges at the competition held at Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki in New Plymouth and Jamie won the Domestic/Commercial division while Max Lumb from Hawera won the Industrial division.</p>
<p>"We were faced with all sorts of things you might encounter in the course of domestic/commercial work," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a bit different for me because I work on boats which is quite different to most domestic or commercial settings."</p>
<p>Master Electricians operations manager Bernie McLaughlin said the calibre of entrants was extremely high.</p>
<p>"All the contestants are apprentice electricians, mostly final year, who are combining on-job training with their employer with off-job training with a training provider."</p>
<p>Jamie is in the second year of his apprenticeship with Etco, a subsidiary of Electrical Contractors of New Zealand which arranges placements and provides coaching and mentoring for apprentices.</p>
