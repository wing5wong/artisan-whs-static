<p><span>HOLIDAY JOB: WHS student Daniel Wilson shows off his engineering handiwork at Axiam Metals last week.</span></p>
<p>Jeff Vigenser of Axiam Metals is happy to have three new employees for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School students Daniel Wilson, Sam Mackie (2nd from left) and Jack Johnston (second from right) say they are delighted to have school holiday jobs and they don't mind the early starts.</p>
<p>The jobs were arranged through the 100% SWEET network and Mr Vigenser said the contact means he has been able to find suitable workers without a lot of stress.</p>
<p>The 100% SWEET (Students in Wanganui, in Education, Employment and Training) initiative came about as the result of the Mayors' Taskforce for Jobs project, with former mayor Annette Main launching Whanganui's own taskforce in 2014.</p>
<p>"I've been on the steering committee from the start and I have a real passion for helping young people gain the experience they need," said Mr Vigenser.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School employment co-ordinator Peter Reid, who is also a steering committee member, was able to identify a short list of students who would be suitable to work at Axiam.</p>
<p>100% SWEET co-ordinator Jason Shailer collected a pile of CVs from Mr Reid and delivered them to Axiam where production manager Mr Vigenser was able to select the most suitable applicants.</p>
<p>Mr Shailer started in his role in September and says he already has over 400 young people on his books.</p>
<p>"They are all hoping to get work, work experience or training and I estimate that there will be 600 by the end of the year," he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Mr Vigenser, the co-ordinator's appointment has made a massive difference in helping him to assist young people.</p>
<p>"I really want to give them that chance to get experience and develop a work ethic but it's impossible to find that time to recruit them."</p>
<p>As for Daniel, Jack and Sam who all have their sights set on engineering careers, the opportunity to work at Axiam has come at a great time.</p>
<p>They are doing basic hand work, drilling holes and de-burring and they get the chance to see professionals at work.</p>
<p>"We have an aging workforce,"says Mr Vigenser. "So it is important for employers to give young people opportunities because they will be needed."</p>
<p>Mr Vigenser said he hopes other Whanganui employers will support 100% SWEET and anyone who has opportunities for young people can contact Mr Shailer at sweetwhanganui@gmail.com or call him on 021 068 3057.</p>
