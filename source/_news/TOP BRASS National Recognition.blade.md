<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Whanganui High School students, both 17, have been selected from Brass Whanganui.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They say most of the touring will be during school holidays so it shouldn't interfere with their studies too much.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Euphonium player Ethan is following a family tradition. His older brothers Jacob and Brad have played with both bands.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ethan will play second euphonium with the National Youth Brass Band.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Cornet player Sarah has moved to Whanganui from Alexandra to board with the Mancer family.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I will be playing repiano cornet with the youth band which is very exciting," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm not sure how old I was when I started playing but I know you have to lose your first teeth before you start so I think I might have been about 6.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My mum played and she encouraged me but I've always loved it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ethan says there was no family pressure for him to play a brass instrument and follow his brothers' lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I started playing when I was 10 and I've always enjoyed playing and enjoy practising so it's not like it's a chore or anything."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School's head of music, Jeannette Jones, says the school is very proud of the selection and will support the young musicians.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"They are both very motivated and good at managing their time but I'm here to encourage them when they need it."</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young musicians will be working with the youth band in Hamilton during July and there will be South Island tours later in the year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will also be rehearsals to prepare for the National Youth Brass Band's 2019 Australian tour.</p>
