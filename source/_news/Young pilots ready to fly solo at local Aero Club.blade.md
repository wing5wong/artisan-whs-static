<p><span>Nathan Mauchline, Chief Flying Instructor, congratulates WHS student, <strong>Cameron Allardice</strong> <strong>on completion of his first solo flight.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Earlier this month, there were smiling faces at Wanganui Aero Club as <span><strong>Cameron Allardice</strong> and&nbsp;</span>Casey Lithgow both completed their first solo flight, and former WHS student <strong>Leroy Johnston gained his Commercial Pilot's Licence </strong>(photo below).</span></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Casey Lithgow's father, Dean, is a pilot, and Casey has been flying for about a year now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I suppose I was influenced by my father and then when I had my first flight it hooked me on it," says Casey. His solo flight was in a Piper PA-38 Tomahawk.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was good - it felt really cool." Chief Flying Instructor Nathan Mauchline flew with him to make sure all was well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then he got out of the plane and I was on my own," says Casey. "It wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be. It was overcast but barely any wind, so it was good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His first flight lasted about 15 minutes. Casey has since flown more solo flights and plans to make a career out of flying.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leroy Johnston works for Downer and did his first flight about three years ago.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's something I've thought about for a long time, since I was at school. Then I finally bit the bullet and rang the Aero Club and went for an introductory flight. I was hooked from that point on. I started flying lessons in the days immediately after."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Gaining a Commercial Pilot's Licence through the Aero Club requires 200 hours total time as well as 12 theory exams to pass.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"You do six to have your Private Pilot's Licence, which is 50 hours, then an additional 150 hours' flying and another six exams," says Leroy. "Eventually I hope to fly full time, but my next step from here is I'm going to have my Instructor rating by Christmas - that's my goal."</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Leroy says he owes thanks to instructor Nathan Mauchline.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"He has invested a lot of time and effort into me."</span></p>
