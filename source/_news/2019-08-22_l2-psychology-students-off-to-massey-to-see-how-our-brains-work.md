This term our Level Two Psychology students visited Massey University for a fascinating day of finding out how our brains work! 

We started with a lecture on Happiness, and then broke into groups where we visited the labs and tried out o a few games and activities. 

The students were fascinated by the skull caps which helped to measure blood flow through the brain (an indication of brain activity), they also tried the glasses which actually record our field of vision which helps to explain how sometimes we only see what is directly in front of us. 

Other activities were an eyewitness statement which proved how susceptible our minds are to suggestion, and then various brain activities which saw the students drawing shapes and scratching their heads!

Trips out into the real world where we can see theory applied are always interesting, and this was a really fun day.
