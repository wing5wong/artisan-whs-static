Our year 12 classes had a great time tramping and camping through the Manawatu Gorge and the Ruahine Rangers. Day 1 consisted of tramping through the Manawatu Gorge which is about 15km. We then tramped through to Triple X Hut and set up camp for the night. It was an early start for us the next morning (330am!) in order to tramp to Sunrise Hut in time for the sun to rise over the east coast. It was an awesome experience and well worth getting up at 3.30am for.
