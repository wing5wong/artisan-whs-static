<p>Lifesavers are asking for help to keep Kiwis safe in the water this summer, and last Thursday marked the first day of the annual Surf Life Saving appeal.</p>
<p>This year Spark NZ is helping, donating 12 new lifejackets to Whanganui Surf Lifesaving.</p>
<p>Over the past 10 years, lifeguards have spent over two million hours on patrol, saving more than 13,700 lives.</p>
<p>Surf Life Saving NZ chief executive Paul Dalton said the summer appeal was an important time for the essential rescue service.</p>
<p>"Not only does [it] allow us to celebrate the remarkable work of our lifeguards but it's [also] a chance to raise awareness about lifesaving services in general and raise much-needed funds to support the 4500 volunteer lifeguards who will be on duty this summer."</p>
<p>Mr Dalton said while lifeguards were proud of the number of lives they had saved, they were most proud of the safety record between the flags.</p>
<p>"We may sound like a broken record but when the flags are up, that means lifeguards are on patrol and this is the safest place to swim when you're enjoying the beach.</p>
<p>"Last season, lifeguards saved 1517 people from life-threatening situations and they're expecting another huge summer and an especially busy Christmas holiday period."</p>
