<p class="element element-paragraph">Reuben Janes' first taste of performing on stage was as an orphan, one of Fagan's gang, in&nbsp;<em>Oliver</em>. His mother, Jane, was also in the production, playing the part of the innkeeper's wife.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was in 2004 so I was only nine years old then. After that, in 2006 I think, I was in&nbsp;<em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em>. The music in that show is awesome," Reuben says.&nbsp;<em>Grease</em>&nbsp;was Reuben's next foray into theatre in 2010.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I played two roles in&nbsp;<em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Fred and The Ghost of Christmas Coming and I played the part of Bill in&nbsp;<em>Funny Money</em>, " Reuben said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 2015 he was involved with the One Act Play Season at Repertory Theatre, playing multiple roles.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've done a lot of backstage work, stage crewing, doing the lighting and sound and I stage managed&nbsp;<em>Stir Crazy</em>, but I've had a bit of a break from theatre since then. I'm back now and loving it," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In&nbsp;<em>Ringing Changes</em>&nbsp;Reuben plays the part of Brad, a typical Kiwi bloke who grunts when he's spoken to unless the topics are cars or rugby and then he won't stop talking.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's in act one but in act two Brad becomes a rugby coach so he's got to be proper now and insists on being called 'Bradley'. He dresses up now and he's quite proud of himself," Reuben says of his role in the play.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reuben's obviously enjoying his return to theatre and says he'll be auditioning for further roles when the opportunity arises. His enthusiasm for theatre is infectious and I look forward to seeing him on stage in Ringing Changes at Repertory Theatre from July 5 to 14.</p>
