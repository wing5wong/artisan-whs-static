Dear Whanganui region parents,

The COVID 19 lockdown and additional requirements to keep your children safe at the dental clinic means that progress with our annual assessment, treatment and prevention work is slower than we expected.

This means there will be some delays in our usual dental mobile roster.  We are working hard to catch up, and will keep in touch with you regarding our progress, as we work through our patient groups.

In the meantime, if you have any concerns about your childâ€™s dental health please call us on:

Whanganui Hospital Dental Unit  
0800 825 583 or 06 3483120 - Monday to Friday


Kind regards,
  
Barb Dewson  
Clinical Manager, Oral Health Services,  
Whanganui DHB
