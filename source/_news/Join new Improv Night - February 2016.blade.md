<p>Hamming it up at last year's inaugural Improv Night were Paul Collins, Jessica Alder, Reuben Janes (former WHS student), and Phil Portland, with ornamental hostess Jenda at the back.</p>
<p>It's official! Wanganui Repertory Theatre will be returning to the stage with a brand new Improv show to start our 2016 season. After a successful workshop last Sunday, in which old hands and new sharpened their improvisation skills in preparation for the show, a cast of four is being assembled for performance next week. Combining the skills and experience of three Rep committee members (Phil Hudson, Reuben Janes and James Graves), these evenings will become regular events to provide some much-needed comedy relief throughout the year. We are aiming to replicate the promising success of the first night held in July last year. Hosted by the flamboyant Jenda, and featuring a seasoned cast of Rep actors, it will set the tone for future performances. Now back in our familiar digs on Ridgway Street we are ready to resume!</p>
<p>This highly-anticipated performance will take place at the Rep Theatre on Saturday, March 5th at 7.30pm. Doors open at 6.45pm, and audience members can enjoy a free glass of wine. Tickets at the door for cash only, $10 each (students $8 each). So for very little cash one can enjoy a night of hilarity from some seriously talented local performers.</p>
<p>And on another note, keep a look out for audition notices for Rep's next production. This will feature two of the plays written by local playwrights for last year's Literary Festival. These plays were performed as rehearsed readings in Keep the Home Fires Burning in September 2015 and brought a fantastic crowd. They will now be performed in April (in time for Anzac Day) as full productions on the Repertory stage. Audition dates will be announced very soon, so watch our Facebook page or newspapers for more details.</p>
<p>We are looking for new blood, and anybody who is interested in performing at Rep or becoming part of our backstage crew is welcome to contact us.</p>
<p>Email dilosrail@hotmail.com, or ring 022 063 6280 for acting president Phil Portland.<br />Next week the cast of our March Improv will be announced as well (including the special guest host), so there's plenty of news to look out for! Stay tuned readers!</p>
