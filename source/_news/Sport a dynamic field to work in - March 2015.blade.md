<p>Former Wanganui High School student Max Carroll is leaving Sport Whanganui to play and work in sport overseas.</p>
<p>"If you're standing still you're going backwards!" That's a favourite catchphrase of Max Carroll. As one of Sport Whanganui's sport development advisors, Max has spent four years helping to build sport in our region, and is now moving to a new sporting adventure overseas.<br />Having arrived in Wanganui from England as a 9-year-old, Max attended Wanganui High School, then spent his gap year in England before completing an Exercise and Sports Science degree at Massey University. At Sport Whanganui, he was initially tasked with supporting targeted sports, but in time became the go-to guy for all codes in capability, planning, structure and governance. A notable success is the development of Hockey Wanganui.<br />"Their numbers have increased in the time that I've worked with them. It's very satisfying to see. It's not an overnight thing, but they're becoming more autonomous now because of what's been put in place - having good governance and best-practice models through their development plan."<br />Max is heading to the UK to play cricket in Reading, England. He is well-known in Wanganui cricket circles as captain of the Property Brokers United Cricket 1st XI in the Wanganui Premier League, and a vital member of the Active Physio Wanganui representative side. He was recently awarded a "baggy" cap for clocking up more than 25 matches representing Wanganui. Max will soon join the Hurst Cricket Club 1st XI based in Wokingham, and playing in Division 2 of the Thames Valley Cricket League.<br />Following the cricket season, he will go to Kaprun, Austria, to gain his ski instructor's licence. An avid skier, Max rates our own Mount Ruapehu pretty highly as a skiing venue, especially for its convenient location.<br />"When it's spring skiing, you can go from the mountain to the beach in a couple of hours."<br />He has visited Austria before, on a European Kontiki tour that took him through about 20 countries.<br />"It's a really nice place, it's picturesque and it's got some of the best skiing in the world, and one of the highest-standard ski instructor's licences you can do.</p>
<p>And that licence is pretty sought after in New Zealand."<br />Max cites Sport Whanganui's in-house coaching project as being "an ideal tool" that he will take with him.<br />"The coaching project has been really beneficial - asking the right questions at the right times to increase people's understanding rather than just telling them."<br />Max acknowledges Sport Whanganui for the opportunity given - "it's kept my parents happy for four years!" - and will miss the team.<br />"I know I probably won't get a better bunch of people to work with."<br />His advice for others wanting to work in sport and recreation?<br />"Never stop wanting to learn, because sport is an ever-changing business. You just need to keep adapting with the times, keep asking questions, keep learning, and never be too self-absorbed that you think you know everything - be open to other people's input."</p>
