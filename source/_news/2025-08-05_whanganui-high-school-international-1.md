🕊️ 80 Years On – Remembering Hiroshima and Looking to the Future 🌏

Today marks 80 years since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 — a moment that claimed tens of thousands of lives and left a lasting impact on generations to come. As we remember this devastating event and honour the memory of those affected, we also look to the future with hope.

We are proud to share that our Head Boy, Jake Newton, and Head Girl, Lilly Terrey, have been selected to represent New Zealand at the 10th Hiroshima Junior International Forum, held in Hiroshima from 14–18 August next week. 

They will join students from around the world to discuss peace, deepen intercultural understanding, and help shape a more peaceful future — a powerful responsibility and an honour, especially in this commemorative year.

Their participation reflects the importance of youth leadership in keeping the lessons of history alive and ensuring a global commitment to peace continues into the next generation.
