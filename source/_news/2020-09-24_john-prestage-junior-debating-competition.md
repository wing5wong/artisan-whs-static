On Monday 21 September our Kowhai team went to Palmerston North Boys High School to compete in the quarter finals of the John Prestage Junior Debating competition. 

The girls were facing off in a limited preparation (40 minutes only!) debate about ‘on-line learning’ and the consequences for the future.  

The team worked as a super-connected device and convincingly negated every point the boys of the affirmative team came up with. It was a pleasure to see how much progress the team has made over time, how they honed their debating skills, as well as their delivering style.

**The girls have now won three in a row and will proudly represent Whanganui High School in the semi-finals later this year.**
