<p>Whanganui's newly-formed band, The People will make their debut at the Royal Wanganui Opera House next Saturday night.</p>
<p>When asked to describe their sound, founder Stan Manthyng says the nine piece collaboration have a punk-pop kind of sound.</p>
<p>"If the Sex Pistols and Bananarama had a baby, it might have sounded like us," he says.<br />Manthyng is better known as a painter of glittering art works than as a musician in Whanganui.</p>
<p>But in the early 1990s Manthyng was half of the goth-pop duo World Gone Wild with Michael Caulfield.</p>
<p>The duo had a minor hit with their single&nbsp;<em>Shy Shy Jenny</em>&nbsp;before Manthyng went on to co- host TV show Queer Nation.</p>
<p>More recently, the artist has performed as Manthyng with DJ Stevolicious and various artists including Mr "nek minnut" Levi Hawken.</p>
<p>"I haven't been doing anything musically for a while because I didn't feel like I had anything to say," says Manthyng.</p>
<p>"People have been asking me if I want to do something and this group of Whanganui people have come together and it's great fun."</p>
<p>Dunedin was home base for Manthyng and his partner Alex Penfold before they found their Don Wilson designed home on Bastia Hill in 2015.</p>
<p>"I heard the Chills would be playing the Opera House at the end of this month and I have the same management so I contacted them to see if we could play support," says Manthyng.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They asked for a recording and we didn't have one so I sent them a recording of our next practice and they are happy with the sound."</p>
<p>Manthyng shares lead vocal duties with Chloe Franklin-Brown and Debbie Head.<br />"It's like that Bananarama sound of three vocalists all singing in the same key," he says.</p>
<p>"We also have a mature go-go dancer who will perform on stage with us."</p>
<p>"I saw her dance at a party and I thought she was fantastic so I asked her to join us and she agreed."</p>
<p>The People will play with The Chills and their special guest Anthonie Tonnon at the Royal Wanganui Opera House on Saturday April 29 at 8pm. Bookings at royaloperahouse.co.nz. Phone 0064 6 3490511</p>
