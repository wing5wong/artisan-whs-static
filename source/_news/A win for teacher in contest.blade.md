<p>Whanganui High School Drama teacher Bridget Rison has won the informal title of the lucky Whanganui Health 2000 shopper, as well as a Russell Hobbs Performance Food Processor and health food products from the Lighthouse and Balance ranges.</p>
<p>"I bought some Balance product and that got me into the draw ... and here we are," says Bridget.</p>
<p>"You also had to be a loyalty customer," says Kim Fielder, Health 2000 shop assistant.<br />Every Health 2000 shop throughout the country had a prize to give away.</p>
<p>Bridget wears a moon boot after falling in a hole on Mt Ruapehu during a recent school Duke of Edinburgh Award trip.</p>
<p>"We were tramping off track on our second day in and fell in a hole ... got a sweet chopper ride out of it though!" she says. "Straight down the Paraparas."</p>
<p>Bridget was also part of the on-stage team at Repertory which put on an Improv night to raise funds to get Vincent Collins to the Globe in London.</p>
