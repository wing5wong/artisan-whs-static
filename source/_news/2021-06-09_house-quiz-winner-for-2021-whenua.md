Our four houses battled it out on 4 June in our annual Whanganui High School ‘House Quiz’ competition. A grand total of 92 teams went over to Jubilee Stadium in an assortment of coloured tutus and creative costumes, and were quizzed on everything from recent politics to Barbie movies.  In the end, **Whenua emerged victorious for the second year in a row, taking out the title as well as the prestigious House Quiz trophy**. 
Congratulations to all our participants, and well done to our winning team ‘Team’ from Moana!
