Two young athletes in the Toyota Whanganui Swim Team competing at the New Zealand Short Course Championships in Hamilton last week returned home with silverware.

Marley Orr claimed silver in the 15-year-old boys' 50m breaststroke and **Whanganui High School student, Regan Hanna bagged his silver in the 13-year-old boys' 100m backstroke.**

Orr also placed 6th in the 100m breaststroke and 8th in the 200m breaststroke. **Hanna finished 4th in his age group 100m freestyle and the 200m individual medley.**

Coach Richard Gheel said injury and illness almost scuppered the team's chances of sending any of its swimmers this year.

"You have to feel for **Ethan Bryers** and young Georgia Abrahams, who had both qualified for the short course nationals this year. Ethan has not been himself for the past four or five months with what has turned out to be a bit of a mystery illness," Gheel said.

"He had qualified in four or five events and did medal last year, including gold. Georgia was training well but dislocated her knee playing netball, leaving just the two boys.

"Marley and Regan almost didn't make it either. Marley tore a ligament a while back and Regan had a shoulder injury that prevented him from full training for four or five weeks, so it was great to see them return home with silver each," Gheel said.
