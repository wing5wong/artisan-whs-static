<p>He may not have won the first challenge but Project Runway contestant Kerry Ranginui did his home city proud on the show's first episode.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While some of the other contestants fretted and fussed their way through the first challenge, the Whanganui contestant kept his cool and produced a very passable cocktail dress and jacket.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Is that a pickup line?" he asked fellow contestant Massey Williams when he said he needed "a woman with a 36-inch bust" to try on his design.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui 33, has been living in Auckland for a decade and working as a pattern maker for Karen Walker for 8 years so he had a definite advantage over contestants like Massey, an alternative education tutor from Christchurch who has only made menswear.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The cocktail dress challenge was won by 23-year-old Aucklander Benjamin Alexander who seems to be gunning for Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Being a pattern maker does not necessarily make you a good designer he rather bitchily told the camera.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nicole Schmidt's pink frock with leather bodice impressed the judges least and Ranginui had warned that it was "a bit skanky."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">I was sad to see the tarot card reading mum from Hawkes Bay disappear so early.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She seemed nice and I did not think her outfit was any worse than Alexander's winning, white number with weird ruffles on the sleeves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The judges -&nbsp;<em>Fashion Quarterly</em>&nbsp;editor Sally-Ann Mullin, World director and designer Benny Castles and a guest judge whose name and designation I did not catch know more about these things than I do and they all loved the "silhouette" of the garment.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The local version of Project Runway seems to be following the format of the American parent show very closely.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It seemed rather clunky as Kiwi versions of American shows always do at the start but there is the potential for the personalities of the contestants to carry it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">No-one could match American Project Runway mentor Tim Gunn for soporific voice and sleek style but fashion design lecturer Andreas Mikellis did a very fair job on the first episode and model host Georgia Fowler smiles at the contestants a lot more than Heidi Klum ever did.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">I'll keep watching and not just to see how our Whanganui boy gets on.</p>
