Sound Canvas was introduced to the Whanganui public last year as part of the Artists Open Studios and its reception was such that organiser, Bruce Jellyman, is bringing the concept back this year. It is a performance of music, visual art, movement and poetry in a space which allows the audience to be surrounded by a visual and music experience. It is immersive, fascinating and inspiring – and it all takes place, along with the audience, on the stage of the Opera House. 
It will be similar to what took place last year but there will be differences says Bruce. “We are pushing the boundaries further all the time.”


Bruce explains, “The performance is in and amongst the audience. It really has to happen on the Opera House stage. Elsewhere, it would be very difficult. It is not so much watching a performance as experiencing and absorbing it.” The audience will be seated but can get up and walk around. “In fact,” Bruce adds, “we encourage you to move around.” There will be no explanations but the programme will list all the music, poetry and art in order.
While the music is being played by Whanganui Brass, it will not be all brass band music. There will be the full band with a string section to just a few players. The band members will also be moving a lot. 
The visual art will be from the art work connected to Artists Open Studios and the poetry will be New Zealand based such as Denis Glover’s ‘The Magpies,’ with some from Whanganui poets. Bruce says, “It will be relatable.”

There will be no curtains on stage but posters on the walls and full stage lighting. A grant has been given by Creative NZ, which will be recording a video of the show. Fortunately we are at Covid level 1 so there is room for 120 in the audience.
While the audience will love it – so will the performers. As Bruce says, “It is so much fun for us to do.”

Sound Canvas is on at the Royal Whanganui Opera House on Saturday, October 31 at 3pm and 7pm and on Sunday, November 1 at 2pm. 

Tickets from the Opera House cost $35 for adults, $30 for seniors and Friends of the Opera House and $20 for students and children.
