<p class="element element-paragraph">Around 80 Whanganui people gathered to remember the anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Squadron leader and RNZAF Ohakea Base chaplain Roger Black led the service at St Peters Church in Gonville to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the WWII battle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The No 9 (City of Wanganui) Squadron, Air Training Corps assisted with the commemoration service and the day was also a celebration of the squadron's formation in 1941.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 1940s, the squadron's focus was to train young pilots to join the Royal New Zealand Air Force.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A number of them were deployed overseas during WWII.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During the 1950s and 60s, the squadron became more youth focused.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 1971, the Air Training Corps stopped being part of the RNZAF and joined the Sea Cadets and Cadet Corps to form the New Zealand Cadet Forces.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former squadron leader Charles Quirk said cadets carried the RNZAFA flag, led the readings and took up a collection for the Missing Wingman Trust.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had two veterans attend the service," said Mr Quirk."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a privilege to have Ivon Warmington and Jack Wallace who both served with the RAF at the time of the Battle of Britain at this afternoon service.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It makes it an extra pleasure to have men who were there, who served New Zealand attend the commemoration."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui New Zealand Cadet Force Units of TS Calliope and Cadet Corps joined No 9 Squadron for the service along with members of RSA Wanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Earlier this month, the No 9 Squadron drill team won the No 75 Squadron trophy for drill in the central North Island area.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They will compete against the winners of Northern and Southern Air Training Corps Units in the Davy Drill Competition.</p>
