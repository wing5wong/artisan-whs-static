Art Day Out with our Year 13 students. To start the day, we heard from an inspirational local artist, Glen Hayward, about the thinking behind his art and [](<>)practices. We visited some galleries, made some pinch pot creations and modified some images with posca pens and thread. Too busy doing stuff to document the day fully, but here's a snippet. Thanks to Sietske, the Art education extraordinaire, from the Sarjeant Art Gallery and Mrs Coombs for the organisation of our wonderful day out of the classroom.
