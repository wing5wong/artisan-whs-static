<p><span>ON ATTACK: Martin Atkinson (black) in action against a Canadian selection last season is now poised to take on the Australians with the NZ Under 23 side next month.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui hockey export and former WHS student&nbsp;Martin Atkinson has a long haul without matchplay until his tour of Australia with the New Zealand Futures Under 23 squad.</p>
<p>The squad leaves for a five test series against Australia on November 17 and Atkinson's final hitout was at the weekend in a New Zealand A side formed to provide India warm-up matches ahead of a clash with the Black Sticks.</p>
<p>"We played two matches over the weekend losing 3-1 and 2-1," Atkinson said.</p>
<p>"The matches were pretty much to help the Indians acclimatise. I was suffering a bit of a flu virus but I'm pretty happy with my performance. I think I held my own."</p>
<p>The New Zealand A side, he said, was filled with possible future Black Sticks and top younger players with big futures.</p>
<p>Atkinson now has nearly six weeks without any official matchplay before leaving for Australia.</p>
<p>"There is nothing officially planned for us (NZ under 23) before we go to Aussie that I know of - no camps or anything. I'll just have to keep my skill level up myself. That long without games does make it harder, but we'll just have to make sure we keep training by ouselves."</p>
<p>The 21-year-old, who came back from Auckland to represent Wanganui in the Central tournament this year and still plays for the Central Mavericks in the National Hockey League under region of origin, will be one of five midfielders in the new look national side.</p>
<p>The 20-man New Zealand U23 team will consist of 10 players who are Under 20, thus eligible for next year's Junior World Cup, plus five players in their final year of Under 21 and five more, including Atkinson, aged 21-23.</p>
<p>Atkinson made the 30-man wider Junior World Cup squad in 2013 while still playing club hockey in Wanganui, however missed selection in coach Grant Edwards' final 18 to go to India.</p>
<p>Since then, he has moved up to Auckland to play club hockey and had set his sights on trying to break into New Zealand senior development team.</p>
<p>Therefore, he welcomed the creation of another tier of youth squad for this Australia series, which will help players underneath the bubble of national selection to keep motivated and working after they turn 21.</p>
