Over the weekend of 5,6 and 7th of September two small bore shooting teams from WHS joined 19 other secondary schools in Palmerston North at the MSRC for the TSNZ Inter-Secondary School, Inter-Island, NZ Secondary Schools Competition.  There were 60 shooters competing, from experienced Master grade through to those new to the sport.

Aria Hill made it through to compete for the North Island Inter-secondary Schools team, which won against the South Island.

Lucian Prime produced the top score from WHS.

Well done to all 6 shooters who represented WHS.

Aria Hill, William Hird, Patrick McCartie, Marshall Munro, Lucian Prime and Angus Summerhays. 

A huge thank you to Linda Carter and Coach David and the team from RSA Smallbore Rifle Range for supporting our rangatahi.
