<p><span>FLYING HIGH: Senior international officer at Deakin University, Rosie Brown, travels to Japan with students.</span></p>
<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world</strong></p>
<p>Six years ago Rosie Brown left school with an ambition to work hard and become successful - the specifics were irrelevant.</p>
<p>Now the former Whanganui High School student is cracking the big time as the senior international officer at Deakin University in Melbourne.</p>
<p>In her job she travels abroad regularly to recruit students, develop partnerships with other universities and manage student internship programmes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how did this global guru nail her dream job?</p>
<p>Straight after finishing high school, Rosie completed a bachelor of arts degree in international relations at Victoria University in Wellington, followed by a certificate in digital marketing with the Marketing Association.</p>
<p>But it wasn't the books alone that got Rosie to where she is now.</p>
<p>"You don't need an international relations degree to do my role," she said. "You just need to be able to think strategically, develop relationships with a wide range of people, and be able to keep up to date with what is going on in the market."</p>
<p>While still a student, Rosie worked a series of part-time and full-time jobs, starting as a customer service representative at investment consultants RaboDirect and later completing a short stint at Massey University as a marketing co-ordinator.</p>
<p>In March 2015, Rosie took a job as student adviser at Deakin University, and it wasn't long before she was promoted to senior international officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 24-year-old said she got to where she is now because her hard work was recognised.</p>
<p>"I have moved roles and been promoted completely based on proving myself internally. People appreciate you going above and beyond at work - and building positive relationships is crucial."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the high demands and heavy responsibilities, Rosie said she loves her job.</p>
<p>"I get to help some incredible young people, who are really going to go places, work towards their goals - and that is so exciting to see.</p>
<p>"Not to mention the travel - I have been to Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan and have trips planned to Taiwan, England and India this year."</p>
<p>Looking into the future, Rosie said she wants to work in international consulting helping businesses to maximise their potential.</p>
<p>"Consulting roles allow you to continuously work with new people and provide fresh eyes which is sometimes what a business needs in order to progress further."</p>
