<p>SUNNY DAYS: The Whanganui Kayak Club team at Lake Karapiro.</p>
<p>THE Whanganui Kayak Club finished fourth in the Tainui Shield rankings of the top clubs at the CRNZ National championships at Lake Karapiro last weekend.</p>
<p>The shield is decided by combining the collective efforts of club members, competing in K1, K2 and K4 events from the Under-14 and novice grades through to Masters.</p>
<p>Whanganui had 40 club members compete at Lake Karapiro and they made 558.5 overall points, behind a strong Poverty Bay team but ahead of Wellington's Mana Club (479 points).</p>
<p>"A fantastic result against much larger population bases," said club member Lisa Chase.</p>
<p>The North Shore club claimed the Tainui Shield with 649 points.</p>
<p>In Masters competition, Whanganui was third, just behind Mana.</p>
<p>The Under-18 class saw Whanganui finish second with 304.5 points, behind Poverty Bay's 437.5.</p>
<p>New Zealand Under-23 representatives Max Brown and Aiden Nositter will race open class today through to Sunday at the Australian GP2 event.</p>
<p>Toby Brooke and Erica Tanner will also compete at Under-18 level, in what will be Tanner's international debut.</p>
<p>"It's more about seeing where they are against world class competition and getting some international race experience at that level," said clubman Peter Brown.</p>
<p>At Lake Karapiro, the 17-year-old Brooke had the biggest medal haul with nine, including three gold of which two were in the Open Men's class.</p>
<p>The top performing female was Masters woman Robyn Scott, with seven medals, closely followed by Kylie Gibson with six.</p>
<p>Amongst the Under-14s, Lucas Thompson secured three medals in a great effort at his first nationals, while top Under-16 performer was Regan Davey with five medals.</p>
<p>"Back on the Whanganui river this weekend it's more about building again for this season and the future" said Brown.</p>
<p>"We have a whole load of youngsters beating the door down to try kayaking, so they get that chance on Saturday at 10.30am with our intro-programme.</p>
<p>"At this stage we aren't sure we have enough kayaks to put them all in."</p>
