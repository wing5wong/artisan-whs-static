<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a day of lots of colour and lots of fun but with a serious underlying message - bullying is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Many Whanganui schools and workplaces turned pink on Friday for Pink Shirt Day which brings people together to make a stand against bullying. People sported clothing, footwear, hats and wigs in varying shades of pink to show their support.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">About 60 Downer staff sported pink high vis vests for the day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Downer's Whanganui alliance manager Dave Nicholls said staff who attended the Whanganui Senior Careers Day had a good response to their pink vests and road crews working in St Hill St had attracted attention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've had some good feedback from people from other businesses," Nicholls said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They thought it was great that schoolkids were walking past and seeing the guys in their vests, knowing that they were supporting the message of Pink Shirt Day."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School student Ben Walkley, 16, was at the Whanganui Senior Careers Day in a pink hoodie with his friend Nicholas Spence, 16, who decided to switch things up a bit with a pink fanny pack.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ben said that when he heard of bullying experiences he felt sorry for those involved.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My friend back in primary school was bullied a bit. I don't know why people do it, jealousy I guess. Maybe they're bigger than the other person or they had a rough childhood.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Personally I have never stepped in which is my biggest regret when I've seen people getting bullied. If you see it, you should step in."</p>
