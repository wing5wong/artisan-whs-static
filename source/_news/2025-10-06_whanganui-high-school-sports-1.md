Congrats to Denby Whittington and Jack Heerdegen at the 2025 Nationals Schools Mountain Bike Champs in the holidays. This was a huge event! 

Denby Whittington had a great weekend finishing 10th in the U15 grade out of 91 riders. 

Jack Heedergan was happy with his seeding run in the u20 grade finishing 65th. 

Denby also raced at the Arapuke Down Hill this weekend. He won u15 and his time was the 2nd fastest overall. Great result for Denby!
