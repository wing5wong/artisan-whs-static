<p><span>CONGRATULATIONS: Marton Scout group leader Kevin Randles presented Duncan Peacock of Marton and WHS student Rebekah Johnson of Wanganui with their Chief Scout's Awards.</span></p>
<p>Marton Scouts Rebekah Johnson and Duncan Peacock received their Chief Scout's Awards on Thursday night.</p>
<p>They were presented with the awards by Marton Scout group leader Kevin Randles.</p>
<p>The award is the highest a youth member can earn in Scouts.</p>
<p>Duncan is from Marton, while Rebekah is from Wanganui.</p>
<p>Both have moved up through the Kea and Cub sections before joining the Scout troop.</p>
<p>It is at least 10 years since the last Chief Scout's Award was presented to a Scout in Marton.</p>
<p>Young people stay in Scouts from school Years 7 to 10 and then can go on to Venturers.</p>
<p>Scouts have a progressive award scheme, which is based on the four cornerstones of outdoors, community, personal development and new experiences, enabling young people to push themselves to achieve personal bests.</p>
<p>The aim is to not only gain practical skills but life skills as well, including leadership, responsibility and confidence.</p>
<p>The presentation was made at the Marton Scout Hall in Cuba St.</p>
