Poppy Brooks-Mann (Year 9) had an outstanding tournament batting .600 and leading the team in RBI's. She and her captain Memory Madams led the team in runs scored. She stole thirteen bases over the course of the tournament. She also showed strength defensively - playing second base, contributing to key outs and showing great instincts for the game. This is a well-deserved honour for this up and coming player.
