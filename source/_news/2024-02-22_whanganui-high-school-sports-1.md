The Aramoho [Whanganui](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/whanganui/) club enjoyed a highly successful New Zealand [Rowing](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/rowing/) Championships regatta at Lake Karapiro this month.

With every member of the small travelling squad of 18 athletes achieving a visit to the podium, the ultimate success of reaching 14 A Finals resulted in Aramoho finishing sixth in the club standings for the Centennial Oar Trophy, ahead of many of the traditional rowing clubs.

The club’s young group of novices, all still at secondary school, were the outstanding contributors to the overall performance, with the sole gold medal for Whanganui coming from the Men’s Novice Coxed Quad of Cristian Kiriona Year 12, Achilles Paikea Year 11, Kynan Brewer Year 12, Jordan Hallet Year 11 and coxswain Lauren Davies Year 12.

All from Whanganui High School, the crew seized control of the race from the outset to win in a time of 6m 55s — a full seven seconds ahead of the second-placed Bay of Plenty Coast crew and Clifton in third place.
