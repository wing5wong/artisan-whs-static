<p>WANGANUI waterskier Lily Meade has returned from her debut world champs and is gearing up for her home tournament this weekend.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Water Ski club is hosting its Gold Star event at Lake Wiritoa from tomorrow , an event which has drawn a huge field. Meade competed last week at the junior world champs in Peru as part of a four-strong New Zealand team and recorded a personal best jump of 22.5 metres.</p>
<p>Team manager Glen Williams said the event taught Meade some valuable lessons.</p>
<p>"I think she learned that the world standard is pretty high so it's going to make her work harder next time," he said.</p>
<p>At 14, Meade is young enough to get another crack at the under-17 event in two years' time. "Lily's the best under-17 female in New Zealand," Williams said. "She knows what it takes now, she's now seen the best under-17s."</p>
<p><span>The Wanganui High School student received the junior sportswoman award at the Wanganui Secondary Schools Sports Awards last year.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Wanganui Gold Star tournament has attracted 57 competitors, the biggest field for many years. It's the first New Zealand tournament of the season which counts towards world rankings.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Water Ski Club will also host the national champs at the end of March. "We get that every five years and that's a big deal for us," president Ron Bakker said.</p>
<p>"That's why entries are really high because everybody wants to come and look at the site," he said.</p>
<p>Bakker said the club had spent many volunteer hours getting the site ready for a "fantastic" weekend. Lily and her brother Brent, along with Nick Bakker are among the locals to watch this weekend.</p>
<p>The action kicks off at 7am on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
