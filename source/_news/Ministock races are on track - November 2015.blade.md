<p><strong>Outside line</strong>: WHS student Trazarn Ryland-Annabell comes around to win the opening Youth Ministock race heat at the Supercheap Autos Oceanview Speedway yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The scheduled 28-race event included a large stockcar field, with 29 listed in the local programme, for the Charlie Berntsen Trophy. As well as that prize, the stockcars were racing in round 1 of the Elite Mechanical Stockcar Cash Challenge. A strong field also entered the West Coast Youth Ministock Championships.</p>
<p>A full report will appear later this week.</p>
