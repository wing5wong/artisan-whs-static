<p><span>LOCKED IN: Wanganui Rugby Union development officer Justin Lock (centre) is no only helping to drive the resurrected secondary schools competition,&nbsp;but he also refereed yesterday's WHS/Ruapehu U15 clash.</span></p>
<p>THE resurrection of the Wanganui Secondary School Rugby Competition is proving popular with players, schools and parents alike.</p>
<p>The absence of a competition at this level over the past five years prompted many teams to either join the Manawatu competition or simply miss game time other than the odd arranged fixture between willing participants.</p>
<p>Driven by a desire to reinstate the Whanganui competition, Wanganui Rugby Football Union chief executive Bridget Belsham and her two community development officers, Justin Lock and Lesley McKenzie, did the rounds talking to potential participants.</p>
<p>Lock said it was difficult talking schools into coming on board at the beginning, but now there was a solid base to run two competitions - an open grade on Saturdays and an U15 grade that plays after school on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>"The open Saturday grade includes 1st XVs from Wanganui City College, Rangitikei College, Ruapehu College, Cullinane College, the Wanganui High School 2nd XV, the Wanganui Collegiate School 3rd XV and the WHS U16 side," Lock said yesterday.</p>
<p>"The U15 grade played on Wednesdays includes U15 teams from Ruapehu, Rangitikei, Cullinane, City College and the WHS U14 team. In fact, the majority of the players in this grade are Year 9 students, so they're quite young.</p>
<p>"Most of these players have had nowhere to go and play or be forced to travel. The Manawatu competition involves teams from Horowhenua, Wairarapa and Palmerston North, so there was a fair bit of travelling to do and, of course, that also costs."</p>
<p>Lock said that, while most of the players at this level did not necessarily mind the travel, he was hard pressed to find parents keen on it.</p>
<p>"They (parents) love seeing their kids playing rugby, but most would prefer having a competition at home. One of the concerns Ruapehu had was the commitment of some of the Whanganui teams to travel up to their patch, especially in winter when the bad weather hits.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"The Ruapehu rugby teams have not played in a competition for five years and I think their concerns may have dated back to those days when teams would often default. That's certainly not the case this time round.</p>
<p>"In the past few weeks when the weather has been pretty atrocious, teams from Cullinane, Rangitikei and Collegiate have been more than happy to make the trip."</p>
<p>Ruapehu College principal Kim Basse said she and the school were delighted the competition had been resurrected.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted, it's a great idea.</p>
<p>"I've been here three years and our 1st XV has not been in a competition during that time.</p>
<p>"We had our first win in a very good encounter with the Collegiate 3rd XV beating them 26-15,"</p>
<p>"It's a long way to travel from Ohakune to compete in the Manawatu competition and then there's the cost - Wanganui is a lot closer."</p>
<p>Lock said with the number of teams in the open grade a bye was needed, but the union had been in talks with Collegiate to allow its 2nd XV to play the side with the bye.</p>
<p>"This also offers the Collegiate seconds more regular game time.</p>
<p>"At the moment they've really only got the traditional home and away matches with other colleges."</p>
