<p class="element element-paragraph">If the Prime Minister can do it, so can some of the country's top women rugby players &ndash; have a baby and keep on doing what you really like doing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There were two special guests at the combined launch of the Mitre 10 Cup and Farah Palmer Cup (FPC) in Auckland yesterday &ndash; the baby daughters of North Harbour's Becky Woods and Waikato's Sosoli Talawadua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Woods, a World Cup winning Black Fern, had 11-week-old Chloe with her while Talawadua brought along nine-week-old Mari Sela-Grace.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both behaved impeccably as their mums were up front, part of the panel being interviewed by MC Nigel Yalden.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A function like this leaves no doubt that New Zealand Rugby is serious about including women as a major part of its future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The two national provincial competitions were launched together for the first time with players from all 14 Mitre 10 Cup teams and the 12 FPC sides present.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bay of Plenty's representatives were veteran Steamers loose forward Tanerau Latimer and Volvanix captain Christie Yule.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both players anticipate September 1 will be a big day at Tauranga Domain with a double header against double champions Canterbury.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For the Steamers it'll be their third consecutive match against a Premiership side, while for the Volcanix, last season's Championship winners, it'll be a way to judge their progress against the 2017 Premiership winning Canterbury team.</p>
