<p class="element element-paragraph">For many graduates locking in a job after study can be a lengthy process but for former Whanganui High School student Brooke Polkinghorne it was no drama.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">How? Well, in the third year of her accounting degree she started studying extramurally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She worked for Doyle and Associates accounting firm in Whanganui three or four days a week while finishing her studies.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not only was she given the opportunity to learn on the job but after graduating she secured a full-time position.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a tough but I was on a steamroller to get it done and Doyles were really supportive," Brooke said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And her hard work has certainly paid off.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now, the 26-year-old is working at Balance Chartered Accountants in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"No day is the same ... it's always something different because everyone's business is different.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a lot more face to face than I thought it would be and less behind the scenes work ... which I love."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Born and raised in Whanganui, Brooke said there is no place she'd rather be.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a really supportive environment here. When you're in a town where everyone knows you and wants you to do well, it's a nice feeling to be supported."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The advice she gave to students considering a career in accounting was to be open-minded to having a secondary degree.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Having a marketing demographic to support your degree is really positive because consultant work is becoming a big part of the job. Also use your contacts because it's often about who you know ... as well as making sure the boxes are ticked."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And to students unsure about what they want to do after they leave school, she said go away and explore what's out there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Don't dive into a degree you're not committed to because it's a waste of time and money."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said the best and the most unexpected part of her job is working with people.</p>
