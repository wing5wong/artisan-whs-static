<p><span>Vincent and his family have been working hard to raise the $8500 required for his expenses, and last Friday a fundraiser - one of many - was held at Repertory Theatre. An evening of improvisation, Whose Line Is It, featured four teachers of drama - Colin Hedivan and Bridget Rison (both Whanganui High School), Sophie Hart (Cullinane - was former WHS student Sophie Kendrick) and Paul. Vincent and fellow student Millie Manning from High School posed situations for the quartet to react to - all spontaneous and off-the-cuff, requiring them to think on their feet. The overall hilarity was heightened by Bridget's hopping on to the stage with her right leg encased in a moonboot. It didn't seem to hamper her movements. I assumed it was all part of the entertainment and expected her to remove it at the end. It was obviously genuine! The evening was a huge success, with almost a full house.</span></p>
