<p class="element element-paragraph">A team of 20 Whanganui riders will make an assault on the Honda New Zealand Motocross Grand Prix at Woodville this weekend with entries in both the senior and junior grades.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Among them are some of Whanganui's top riders ranging in age from 5-60 years, but is perhaps the junior ranks the ones to watch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">(Other WHS students highlighted)<strong> Jaxon Watt</strong>, Chase Williamson, <strong>Olly Dennison, Riki Wainhouse and James Rountree</strong> will be key players, while in the senior class Aden Brown, Andy Glasgow and Hunter Gilbertson are expected to race well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Rountree</strong> is coming off a good weekend in New Plymouth at the King of the Mountain where he was 5th in the 15-16-year 125cc class on Saturday before moving up to the senior ranks on Sunday and racing in the national 125cc class where he finished 7th in his first senior outing, including a credible 4th in the third race. <strong>Rountree</strong> will be racing both days this weekend at Woodville.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Top riders from Australia will be competing with over 400 riders racing over the two days with NZ1 Mount Manganui's Cody Cooper the hot favorite to win the Mx1 class, although he will be pushed hard by Rhys Carter (Mount Manganui), the current No3.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Carter won the King of the Mountain in Taranaki at the weekend and so is perhaps in form to topple Cooper, his mid-week training buddy.</p>
