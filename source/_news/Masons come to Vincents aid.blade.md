<p>Whanganui's Vincent Collins, along with 23 other students from around the country, has been selected to represent New Zealand as part of the Shakespeare Globe Centre New Zealand Young Shakespeare Company 2017 (SGCNZ YSC 2017).</p>
<p>He is travelling to the Globe Theatre in London in July this year to work alongside the other students and to work with professional tutors and directors. The students will perform a Shakespearean play at the Globe.</p>
<p>To help him along his way, the Ruapehu-Manawatu Districts Masonic Youth Trust has offered assistance by way of a donation of $1000.</p>
<p>Trust secretary Colin Johnson presented the cheque personally at Vincent's home.</p>
<p>It came about when Vincent was exploring possible funding avenues and contacted one of the local Freemasons' lodges. Their annual grants had already been disbursed so they passed his application on to the youth trust.</p>
<p>Colin was impressed with Vincent's application.</p>
<p>"What a wonderful time it was sitting down and reading your dossier. The presentation was superb," he says.</p>
<p>The size of the grant was a surprise to Vincent.</p>
<p>According to the conditions of the grant, the money must be used for course fees in the UK.</p>
<p>"Our deed precludes giving money for travel," says Colin.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Ruapehu-Manawatu Districts Masonic Youth Trust will fund and support efforts to enhance and improve people's goals in cultural, educational, emotional, moral, social, economic and physical improvement areas and the welfare of an individual. The trust also serves to alleviate distress and assist in the maintenance and improvement of the quality of life of persons in reduced or underprivileged circumstances.</p>
<p>The Globe workshop is a New Zealand event.</p>
<p>Even in the UK, there is nothing similar set up for British students.</p>
<p>"The play we're doing is&nbsp;<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>," says Vincent, but what role each of the students will play will be down to the director. A number of them will be assigned to each character. "We have to learn the gist of the play and when we get there we'll audition, get put in our roles and then learn our lines."</p>
<p>Having acted in the play in Year 9, Vincent is hoping to be cast as one of the Montague clan, one of Romeo's brothers. Colin says he hopes Vincent will be willing to give a verbal report to the trust members on his return from the Globe.</p>
<p>He is waiting to hear about other applications and he has a Givealittle page - (givealittle.co.nz/cause/getvinnietotheglobe). There are other fundraising ventures planned for this year.</p>
<p>Late last year, Vincent and his "acting buddy", Caitlyn Friedel, performed their regional winning five-minute Shakespearian piece - Henry V, Act 3, Scene 4 (in French) - at the welcoming ceremony at Government House. Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy has since become one of the patrons of SGCNZ.</p>
<p>The Ruapehu-Manawatu Districts Masonic Youth Trust welcomes grant applications from local individuals (Whanganui, Palmerston North, Waimarino and Rangitikei areas) under the age of 25 for New Zealand-based activities. Conditions are available on request. For further information contact the trust secretary, Colin Johnson, at colin.johnson@xtra.co.nz.</p>
