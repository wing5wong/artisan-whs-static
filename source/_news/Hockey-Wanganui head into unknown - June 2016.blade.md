<p>ONE TO WATCH: WHS student Rebecca Baker continues to stand out for the combined Wanganui team in the Manawatu Division 2 competition.</p>
<p>THE combined Wanganui team are right where they hoped to be at the end of the round robin of Manawatu Hockey's Women's Division 2 after their important 6-1 win over High School Hockey Club B at Gonville on Saturday.</p>
<p>The victory left Wanganui second on the table behind the unbeaten College Development and consigned HSHC B down to fourth spot behind clubmates HSHC Evergreens - Wanganui having compiled a 6-2 winning record, of which one of the losses was an unintended default.</p>
<p>However, player/coach Colleen Baylis said they do not yet know what that all means as no draw has been released for the semifinals and the season is not scheduled to be completed until August.</p>
<p>It is possible the nine-team grade will now split into separate Top 4 and Bottom 5 competitions, as has happened in the past.</p>
<p>"That's still leaving a little bit of time there," Baylis said.</p>
<p>"What they've got planned, I don't know. You'd expect they'd have something prepared."</p>
<p>Whether there is a delay until some semifinals or a Top 4 round robin, Wanganui know they have the measure of HSHC B and the Evergreens, having defeated the latter 5-2 in their third match.</p>
<p>However, College Development have been head and shoulders above everyone else - scoring 56 goals and conceeding only 10 - which included a 7-0 whitewash of Wanganui in May.</p>
<p>Wanganui still recovered well in later games and have easily the next best statistics with 55 goals scored and 15 conceded, so Baylis would welcome another regular match with College outside of a finals situation.</p>
<p>"Pretty pleased we sort of managed to maintain [momentum] all the way through. Fly the banner for Whanganui somewhere.</p>
