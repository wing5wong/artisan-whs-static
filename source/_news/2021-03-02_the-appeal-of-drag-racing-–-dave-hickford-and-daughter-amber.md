Dave Hickford says, “I’ve loved V8 cars since I was 17 and got into buying old V8 vehicles.”  That was put on hold while starting a family until 2014, when he bought a HZ Holden Ute. 

It was a 1980s ute with a 400 small block Chev but it was destined to ‘grow.’ While doing drag racing in Masterton “it gave up on me.”  So in 2018 he got Dean Scott from Rivers Speed and Spares to build and install a 540 big block Chev, which produces 750 HP while using 96 octane gas which, you can of course, buy from a petrol station.

He also had the 400 turbo transmission beefed up and it has a 9 inch diff.  These improvements made the ute stronger and more reliable, and last weekend he got 2nd in the Super Street Class at the New Zealand National Drag Racing Series in Masterton.

He will be racing in the Whanganui Street Drags this Saturday, but points out “the road surface, unlike the one in Masterton, does not give you as much traction, so you can’t use all the vehicle’s horsepower.” 

**Seventeen year old daughter, Amber**, has caught the bug and accompanies Dave at most races as a passenger and can’t wait until she can get behind the steering wheel.  But it is not for the faint-hearted.  Amber says, “You need to wear a helmet, have a neck brace and be in overalls.” 

The Holden is also a street legal car – great when you are being taken to school or going on road trips.

Dave will race five times a year in Masterton, in Wellington and in Whanganui.  He was thinking about racing in New Plymouth but is opting out in favour of going fishing instead.

As for the Whanganui event – he is happy just to “have some fun and perhaps smoke the tyres.”  He will have three runs in the morning qualifications and at least another couple in the afternoon.
