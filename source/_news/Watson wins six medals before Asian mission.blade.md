<h3>Whanganui judo exponent Keightley Watson (left) had a solid warmup towards his tour to Hong Kong next month with a six medal haul at the Waikato Bays Open in Rotorua at the weekend.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The globe-trotting 16-year-old met local level competition at the Rotorua Event Centre, winning five golds and a bronze.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Entering multiple divisions, he won the Cadet Open, Cadet +81kg, Junior Men's Open, Junior Men +100kg and Senior Men's +100kg, while coming third in the Senior Men's Open.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">From the Wanganui Judo Club, Watson's brother Callaghan (right in above photo) took bronze in the Senior Boys +66kg, while Marshall Littlefair also got bronze in the Senior Boys Under 32kg.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Keightley Watson, who has been training in the Netherlands and had to take a break from competition in April due to a fracture in his left leg, will compete in two weight divisions in Hong Kong.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Whanganui judo referee Diane Limbrey is also globe-trotting as she is currently in Austria where she represented New Zealand refereeing in the Junior European Cup in Leibnitz</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Limbrey said it is a very strong competition with 580 competitors from 39 countries taking part over two days.</p>
