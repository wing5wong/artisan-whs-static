<p class="element element-paragraph">Oh what a tangled web we weave. Recently I had a chat with three more of the young cast members of Repertory Theatre's production,&nbsp;<em>Ringing Changes</em>, and learnt that a lot of the plot and humour of the play centres on their relationships and switching partners.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Caius Wrigglesworth, who plays Andrew, has a girlfriend, the girl next door, played by Meynell Smith. That's in Act One. In Act Two she has switched her allegiance to Andrew's sister Jessie. In Act One Jessie's girlfriend is Maxine, played by Mikayla Walker but in Act Two Maxine has become Andrew's girlfriend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Andrew is quite a high flyer, dabbling in the stock exchange. He's quite cocky and not very nice at all," says Caius of the character he plays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">These young adults are all doing quite different things in their lives away from the theatre. Caius is studying to become a structural engineer, Meynell is still a school student and Mikayla is a singing teacher.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Are they having fun, enjoying the theatre process? "Yes!" they chorused, "It's just such a fun play. There's a nice energy there with really good chemistry between the characters so we all get on really well. It's all quite good fun. "</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">I wish them all, cast and crew alike, a very successful season.<br /><em></em></p>
