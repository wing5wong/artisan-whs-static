It was no walk in the park when Dee Brough and I went to Kowhai Park to take photos to publicise Repertory Theatre’s new pantomime Peter Pan. 

The pirate ship was overrun with Lost Boys and the pirates were having a tough job fighting them off. First Mate Smee did seem to be enjoying himself as he chased around after the boys, in fact it was hard to tell who was having the most fun — Smee or the smaller children.

Captain Hook, looking rather like England’s King Charles the second with his long curly black wig, waved his cutlass and terrified any ‘hornswagglers’ who might cross his path. When he’s not impersonating Captain Hook, Richard Leith is a Whanganui lawyer who’s appeared in many musical and dramatic productions here. I’ll never forget him playing the title role in Buddy Holly a few years back— he was great.

This panto will be 13-year-old William Herd’s first appearance on Repertory Theatre’s stage. He has previously appeared in two Amdram productions as Dulboot in Bad Jelly the Witch and Peter Pevensie in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.

Other spare time pursuits for William include playing football, cricket and playing the piano. He also enjoys taking his two dogs to the beach.

William is very much looking forward to starting Whanganui High School next year where ‘Smee’ (also known as Paul Keene), is a teacher of digital technology.

Dee Brough took photos of our fearsome trio before the crocodile appeared to chase them away. We do have a crocodile in our Peter Pan production but have no fear — he’s muzzled so only wicked pirates need be afraid.

Peter Pan, the Pantomime is on stage at Repertory Theatre from 7.30pm on Thursday, November 26 to Saturday, December 5. There is a matinee on Sunday, December 29 at 2.30pm.

Lots of fun, music and jokes ... I’m sure you’ll all enjoy it.
