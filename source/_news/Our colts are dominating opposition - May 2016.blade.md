<p><span>CRUNCH TIME: Wanganui High School No7 Dylan Bowater (head gear) meets solid opposition at home on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>BOTH Whanganui teams in the McDonald's Manawatu Colts division continue to dish out lessons in rugby to their rivals after dominant performances on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XV handed out a 50-14 thrashing to Freyberg on a home game, while St John's Club Whanganui Metro beat Feilding Old Boys Oroua 41-24 with a commanding performance in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Metro's Carl Gibson, who co-coaches with Darryl Malcolm, said while the encounter with FOB was very physical, the Whanganui lads showed they were up for the task with forwards and backs combining to produce the win.</p>
<p>"Feilding were quite physical, but our boys were up to it," Gibson said. "Openside flanker Corbin Warren had an outstanding game, while lock Stefan Hannan simply commanded the lineouts to retain ball. Shayden Phillips also stood out at second-five. He was brilliant on defence and made some very telling runs."</p>
<p>WHS coach Charles Osborne nor manager Richard Bennett could be contacted for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WHS remains unbeaten after round five, while Metro has had one narrow 12-10 loss to defending champions Massey White in round three. Metro lead the competition on 17 points, while WHS sits second on 16, but have played one less game after sitting out their bye. Metro has yet to have the bye. Massey White and Massey Ag are tied on 12 points.</p>
<p>"Both Whanganui teams are right up there in the competition, but we have yet to get the bye, while most of the others have had theirs, including WHS. It will be interestimg when we meet," Gibson said. Ironically, a number of the Metro squad are ex-WHS players who have left school.</p>
<p>Metro play Old Boys Marist Lightning Dolphins at Whanganui City College at 1pm.</p>
