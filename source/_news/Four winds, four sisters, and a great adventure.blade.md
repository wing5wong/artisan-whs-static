<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Four Whanganui sisters have made climbing up a 30m mast and sailing around the Hauraki Gulf part of family tradition.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youngest of the lot, Leila Collinson, was fourth down the chain to jump on board the Spirit of Adventure and complete a 10-day ocean voyage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A challenge that was made unmissable after the hype she received from her three older sisters.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 16-year-old said her eldest sister did it as part of a class trip and loved it so much the rest of them couldn't resist following suit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are all really similar and all love the outdoors, after seeing the photos and hearing the stories our minds were all made up."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it would not have been made possible without obtaining sponsorship from community trusts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It wasn't cheap but it was something I really wanted to do so I applied to various trusts and received funding from the Spirit of Adventure Trust, Four Friends Trust, Margaret Watt Children's Trust and Whanganui District Council Youth Committee."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And even though she had been given the full run down from her older siblings, the experience still exceeded expectations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said it was daunting having to catch a flight to Auckland alone and make her way to Princes Wharf with no assistance but within five minutes of being on board she had made a ton of friends.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everyone was so welcoming and the days were just packed with adventure."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said every day was a challenge - from 6.30am ocean swims to climbing a 30m mast and rafting around Great Barrier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But all worth it, you gained so many life skills like leadership, teamwork, independence and confidence."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leila said she would encourage anyone looking to gain these skills and live a once in a life time opportunity to do it.</p>
