What a wonderful evening we had on Thursday night, celebrating the copious amount of talent in our Performing Arts Department.  

Congratulations to our two main award winners: Abby Squire picked up 4/5 ELITE Awards, most notably, Dux Artium 2020 and Grace Swanston won the Principal's Cup for Excellence in the Arts.  

Sasha and Mrs Jones did an awesome job, alongside the amazing Cultural Prefects, to organise the seamless event.  üëè  

Here are our Performing Arts winners and a few images from the evening.  

Thanks to Angus Pitkethley and Aaron Cogan for photographing the evening.
