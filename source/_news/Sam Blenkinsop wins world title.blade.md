<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui-born and bred mountain bike racer Sam Blenkinsop (former WHS student) celebrated one of his best seasons yet with a world title at the Canadian Open Downhill track at Crankworx Whistler on Sunday.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sharing the overall season podium with elite female winner, Australian Tracey Hannah, <strong>Blenkinsop who, on top of becoming the Crankworx Downhill Champion, also earned the title of King of Crankworx 2018.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Kiwi finished the day in fourth place in the Canadian Open, wrapping up a season that included two wins at Crankworx Rotorua, a second in Innsbruck, and a fifth place finish in Les Gets for the Crankworx World Tour title.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And while he expressed slight disappointment at having just missed Sunday's podium, he said to finally clinch the King title after a couple years of coming close was "a pretty sweet way to end the season."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"After Rotorua I felt like I had a pretty good points lead so I was like, 'Well, might as well keep going and try and do as many events as I can,'" Blenkinsop said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To come away with the win at the end of the season is awesome. And also the downhill overall&hellip;It just gets you pumped up and more excited for next year, for all the Crankworx events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I always really enjoy the downhills at Crankworx events. They're always the best tracks, always fresh, and the crowd's always awesome, so it's always a big thing for me to come to Crankworx because it's just so sick."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The King title earns him a bonus $20,000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 27-year-old is part of the strong Norco Factory Racing team and is now off to La Bresse, France for the World Cup competition.</p>
