Three tough games today for our Girls at the Condor 7â€™s in Auckland.  

We lost to Sacred Heart Girls College Hamilton 19-5  
Howick College 31-7 and Manurewa High School 22-7  
Three hard games against top schools. 

If the girls win their last pool game in the morning against St Maryâ€™s Wellington they will get another game in the bowl quarter finals ðŸ¤ž  

All the best team! ðŸ’šðŸ’›
