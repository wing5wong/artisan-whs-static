<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>London-based internationally recognised chef Peter Gordon, a veteran in New Zealand&rsquo;s hospitality industry who has founded restaurants here and overseas, took out the main Supreme Award for his outstanding and ongoing philanthropic efforts &mdash; including through the creation of annual culinary events held in New Zealand and Britain, in which proceeds are donated to various charities.</strong></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gordon has raised more than $16 million in support of Leukaemia research in less than 20 years, much of this was raised through hosted dining events including &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Cooking Dinner&rdquo;.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gordon, who is the head chef of Sky City restaurants The Sugar Club and Bellota and The Providores and Tapa Room in London, said it was &ldquo;incredible&rdquo; to receive the accolade.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;When they first contacted me and said &lsquo;We&rsquo;d like you to accept this award&rsquo; I kind of thought they had got the wrong email to be honest because I&rsquo;ve seen what other previous winners have done to get that,&rdquo; Gordon told the Weekend Herald.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gordon has supported and made significant contributions to charities the Raukatauri Music Therapy Centre, the Restoration of Appearance and Function Trust, Leukaemia &amp; Blood Cancer New Zealand and the New Zealand LAM Charitable Trust and Leuka.</p>

<p data-bind="text: $data">Kea Global chief executive Craig Donaldson said <strong>Gordon &ldquo;embodied what it meant to be a world class New Zealander&rdquo;.</strong> &ldquo;Not only is he an incredibly talented chef, but his ongoing commitment to his philanthropic endeavours shows an immense generosity of spirit,&rdquo; Donaldson said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gordon credits his grandmother Molly for giving him a sense of charity and community, and for teaching him to bake.</p>
