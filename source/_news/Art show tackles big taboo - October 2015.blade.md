<p><span>RAISING AWARENESS: Artist Te Autiti Hikaka-Gilsenan (WHS student) and 6-year-old Violet Mansell, with some of the artworks in the He Taonga Awhina exhibition.</span></p>
<p>Nine Maori artists have come together for an exhibition on suicide.</p>
<p>He Taonga Awhina - The Treasured Gift of Life - is currently showing at Gallery On Guyton.</p>
<p>The professional and emerging artists in the show are Bill Ranginui, Ngatai Taepa, Jade Ormsby, Claudine Muru, Hinemoa Ranginui, Glen Hutchins, Nigel Scanlon and Te Autiti Hikaka-Gilsenan.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of media, including paintings and carvings.</p>
<p>Organiser Hinemoa Ranginui said all the artists were passionate about enhancing the lives of their communities, and hoped their art would help the conversation around suicide.</p>
<p>"Suicide is a significant community health problem," she said.</p>
<p>"The key message is that suicide is preventable, and it's everybody's business."</p>
<p>Ms Ranginui said art prints featuring the artists' designs were for sale during the exhibition.</p>
<p>A percentage from each art print sold would be donated to Te Ora Hou, a Wanganui-based community and youth support organisation.</p>
<p>Ms Ranginui said six of the artists taking part in the exhibition had contributed artwork to a poster, which included a list of places to get help.</p>
<p>"These have been distributed to schools and local support services, and there are also some available for the public at Gallery On Guyton."</p>
<p>Everyone who visits the gallery also has the opportunity to win a poster featuring Tanemahuta, a collaboration between Bill Ranginui and Jade Ormsby.</p>
<p>The exhibition was sponsored by Waka Hourua and Creative New Zealand. It runs until October 17.</p>
