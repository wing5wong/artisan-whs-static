<p class="element element-paragraph">More than 90 young musicians from the Whanganui region competed in the annual New Zealand Community Trust Chamber Music Contest last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui District Contest took place on Friday, June 9 at the Prince Edward Auditorium, Wanganui Collegiate School and was one of 15 district contests being held nationwide.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was adjudicated by bassoonist and composer Ben Hoadley. Ben is lecturer at the University of Auckland, where he has taught bassoon and chamber music since 2007. He is principal bassoonist with the Sydney Omega Ensemble and has worked with orchestras around the world. Ben holds degrees in bassoon performance from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the New England Conservatory (Boston) and a Master of Music with first class honours in composition from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year the Whanganui Contest attracted 29 ensembles involving 94 musicians with six groups travelling from Marton.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The groups range from standard chamber music ensembles with violin or flute, cello and piano, to groups with singers, six hands on one piano, guitar trio and percussion groups, all playing a variety of styles of music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealand Community Trust Chamber Music Contest is the longest running youth music competition in New Zealand and in 2015 celebrated its 50th anniversary.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is the only nationwide chamber music competition for young musicians and composers and is well-known for nurturing young musicians who go on to successful musical careers in New Zealand and abroad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as organising the contest, Chamber Music New Zealand also arranges coaching and open workshops for ensembles with the support of ABRSM.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, Whanganui was lucky enough to be awarded coaching sessions with Doug Beilman, former violinist in the NZ String Quartet. In their sessions with Doug, students learned more about bringing the music to life through characterisation and communication.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year there were 17 composition entries in the original composition section of the contest including one entry from <strong>Whanganui High School student Ben Power.</strong> <strong>Ben's&nbsp;<em>Prelude &amp; Fugue in D Lydian for Piano and Violin</em>&nbsp;was performed by trio The Classical Modes Take Two with Ben on piano.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wellington-based composer, and lecturer in composition at Victoria University, Michael Norris, will select two winning scores (junior and senior) and the winning composers will be announced this month. The winners will be awarded SOUNZ cash prizes and a year's subscription to CANZ (Composers' Association of New Zealand).</p>
