On Saturday 6th of April WHS took 4 students to the Xterra Rotorua festival.

3 students Lennox Brotherton Y12, Hadley Wilson Y12 and Darcy Johnston Y12 entered the Duathlon [](<>)which was a 26 km Mountain Bike ride though the redwoods, followed by a 11 km trail run (2 laps around Blue lake).

The boys did very well, with Lennox finishing 2nd, Hadley 3rd and Darcy 4th in their 14- to 19-year-old age group. What was more impressive was that Lennox finished 3rd, Hadley 4th and Darcy 15th overall, which was a testament to the training they have put in.

Romy Schmeling Y11 entered the short course triathlon finishing a credible 42nd out of 103 competitors and 7th in her age group.

Well done to everyone involved and a huge congratulations to Mr Barnett who also competed in his age group coming 2nd!!
