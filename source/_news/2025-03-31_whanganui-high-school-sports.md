Well done to our boys volleyball team finishing on a high today at the Nationals.

Day 4: we started strong winning our first game of the day against Trident High school. Our second game was a close game against Tawa, but unfortunately losing 2-0 putting us in the playoffs for 7/8th on Friday.

Day 5: We played against Hastings Christian School winning 2-1 placing us 7th in Division 6.

The boys worked hard and hustled hard, leaving everything out on the court. Congratulations to our boys, and wish our yr 13s all the very best for their future endeavours.
