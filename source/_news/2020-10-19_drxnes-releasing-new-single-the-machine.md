Whanganui five piece **Drxnes** will release their new single **'The Machine'** on Tuesday, complete with a new music video made entirely by **guitarist and band founder Isaac Chamberlain**.

Chamberlain told the Chronicle that it had been almost a year since the band had released new music, and that the new single was "heavier and darker" than anything they had recorded before.

"We took lockdown as a little break, and maybe it wasn't a bad thing to have a bit of time off and come up with some new ideas to work on," Chamberlain said.

"Everyone in the band has families, and we were practising two or three times a week, so it was important that we didn't burn out.

"It's about using that energy as best you can, and the lockdown gave us a chance to refocus and restructure what we're actually trying to do.

Chamberlain, whose projects include Machete Clan and Something Zesty, said that the band had been able to grow a "pretty loyal fanbase" in the last couple of years, and he was happy to be able to offer them a brand new track.

"We've only got five songs out at the moment, so it was important for us to release some new content and put a bit more 'bait on the hook'".

"Having Liam Robertson playing bass now has meant that he's brought a whole bunch of new ideas in as well, and he pretty much drives this new song.

"It's definitely a step up for all of us, in terms of ambition as well."

Chamberlain said he had completed the animated music video for 'The Machine' during lockdown, which he had initially thought would have been "impossible" until Covid-19 had provided him with "weeks and weeks" of downtime.

"It's quite 'staggery' animation, which saved me some time.

"The message of the song itself is quite impactful too I think, especially with the video, and it focuses on the capitalistic times we're living in.

"It still feels really Drxnsey though, and I think it's a good step forward for the band.

The new single was the first to be recorded without a metronome, Chamberlain said, after **drummer Ethan Coleman** had laid down a guide track that was "too good not to keep".

"That definitely gives the song a much more human feel, and there are parts that speed up a tiny bit and then pulls back.

"It does feel like it's breathing a bit and definitely adds to the intensity of the parts."
