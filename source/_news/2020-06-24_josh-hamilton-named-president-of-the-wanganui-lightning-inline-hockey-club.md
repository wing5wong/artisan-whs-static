Hi, my name is Josh Hamilton and I am the president of the Wanganui Lightning Inline Hockey Club.

I have played inline hockey for 22 years and each one has been as challenging as the last.

This is my second year running this club, and after playing for so long I decided to step up and give back to the club which has provided so much for me a long with many others.

Ideally I'd love to leave the club in a better position than when I inherited it, which is why I'm using as many platforms to connect with current players, reconnect with old players/club members and look to attract new people to the sport.

If anyone who would like to give inline hockey a try, or who used to play and wishes to have a casual skate around, please dont hesitate to reach out. We would love to have anyone interested to come down and give it a go.

Contact us on Instagram, facebook or email. We would love to hear from you.
