<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>At 17, Whanganui High School student Ana Gilligan is an author, and that's all she's ever wanted to be.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've wanted to be an author since I was seven," she says. "I've been working on a collection of short stories, and it suddenly occurred to me that I could have them published. So, at about 10 [o'clock] one night I put them all together and sent it to a bunch of publishing houses. I heard back from one and I didn't like it. About three months after I'd sent it, one came in the mail last week - an actual publishing contract."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The acceptance letter was from Austin Macauley Publishers, a reputable firm with offices in the UK, US and Australia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They said with optimistic views they think it could sell and they thought it was delightful and insightful," says Ana. "Such a compliment!"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her stories are written with teenagers and young adults in mind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really like to experiment with what I can do, so most of them are out of my genre. They're romance, and I typically wouldn't write that, and they're all based on the idea of soulmates. I'm very fond of them but it's not something I would pick up and read myself.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had the idea and thought, I'm going to write it, and it kept happening."<span style="background-color: #e2e2e2;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ana has decided to publish her short stories under a secret pseudonym.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Getting her stories published doesn't come for free.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have to pay $4000 to get them published," says Ana, but Austin Macauley will do everything else, including marketing the book of stories.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The company has said in the contract that if Ana wants to publish anything else, they'd like first rights.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ana is also writing a novel she hopes to publish under her own name. It's about the writing, but it's also about being a published author.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I want people to fall in love with my characters and get to know them like I do," she says. "They're all very special to me."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ana still intends to go ahead and study biology at university, with a possible career in the field of genetics ... or she may find that her writing takes off.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ana's mum, Dionne, says her daughter has been a reader from an early age, picking up the Million Words trophy at Mosston School in year 6. Her reading is broad and varied, but she likes to be challenged. While she likes a good story, she can be critical of writing styles.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't like reading from first person ... I don't like reading through someone else's eyes, I want to see everything, not just this person's perspective. Like reading The Hunger Games was very narrow, and while you got lots of opinions there wasn't a lot to see." And don't expect to see a lot of romance in her novel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I go to a bookstore and I pick up a book .. it's dystopian, apocalyptic, and then ... she's looking for a man! Or there's a love triangle involved. I cannot stand it!"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ana is an equal opportunities writer - her characters are from a variety of races, cultures and gender perspectives. But first Ana needs to get her short stories published. She is looking at various funding ideas and has set up a funding page on-line.</p>
