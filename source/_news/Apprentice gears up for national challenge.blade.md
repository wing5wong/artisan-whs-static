<p><span>Electrical apprentice Nathan Brown will compete against the country's top electrical apprentices in the Master Electricians Challenge competition.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just really enjoy the work - particularly the variety and the problem-solving aspect of it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The increased understanding of how electrical equipment works has enhanced Mr Brown's sound engineering skills. He still mixes for bands, has volunteered at the Royal Wanganui Opera House and worked on sound for events such as Homegrown.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Brown begins the four-day challenge in Auckland on August 22.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The country's top 10 electrical apprentices will battle it out for top honours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The finalists, five each in the domestic/commercial and industrial divisions, scored the most points out of 150 entrants in regional competitions throughout New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Master Electricians operations manager Bernie McLaughlin said entries for this year's regional competitions had rocketed, with employers and trainers using preparation for the contest as part of their training programmes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That made it tougher than ever to get through to the final 10," Mr McLaughlin said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For the challenge final, the apprentices will face five rounds of two-hour-long modules, completed over three days of competition, interspersed with off-site challenging activities, team bonding and generally an amazing and life changing experience for all involved."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Master Electricians chief executive Neville Simpson said apprentices were in high demand across all trades in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The goal of the challenge, which is in its 16th year, is to promote the benefits of electrical apprenticeships and recognise excellence, quality and innovation in the industry.</p>
