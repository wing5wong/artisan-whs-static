<p><span>Josh Hill, right, pictured here with father Hunter and brother Stave.</span></p>
<p>The mother of the 21-year-old Wanganui man killed in a hunting accident says he "would be devastated to be the cause of our pain".</p>
<p>Joshua Hunter Hill was killed carrying a gun over a fence at Ruatiti near Raetihi on Sunday, police have said.</p>
<p>Mr Hill was out hunting with friends.</p>
<p>He was a member of the RNZAF based at Ohakea and a former student of Aranui School, St Marcellin School and Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>Mum Judy Hill said her son's death was a tragic accident that should not have happened because he was trained in the use of firearms. He had a gun licence and was trained by the military.</p>
<p>"He would not have wished to do anything to hurt his family and I know he would be devastated to be the cause of our pain.</p>
<p>"We are so proud of him, he was a credit to us and he loved his life - he was always doing lots of things."</p>
<p>Mrs Hill said her son was a keen rugby player and always had a lot of friends.</p>
<p>"When he moved to the base at Ohakea, I not only missed him - I missed his friends as well.</p>
<p>Mrs Hill said the family are grateful for the support of the RNZAF - Joshua's brother Stave is also an airman, who was training in Auckland when he heard of his sibling's death.</p>
<p>"They organised a flight to bring him home to be with his family and I am very glad he is here with me and his dad Hunter, brother Sam and Josh's partner Elise."</p>
<p>The family will hold a service at their home in Longbeach Drive on Friday.</p>
