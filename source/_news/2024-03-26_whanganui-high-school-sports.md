WHS Slowpitch Softball 

Yesterday was Finals Day for the slowpitch softball competition.

Well done to the WHS Seniors who beat Cullinane in the Grand Final [](<>)9-4 and Taylah Waitokia earning MVP for the season.

Our WHS Junior team showed great sportsmanship in their game against WGC, winning the game for 5th and 6th in the competition. Well done to Asher Pohl earning himself MVP for that team.

A huge thanks to the coaches of these teams who finish work early on Monday afternoons to support our tamariki. Paul Brewer, Jessie Madams, Stephen Barnes and Rob Gribble - your time is much appreciated.

And thanks to the Whanganui Softball Association for running this awesome competition and Pita Pit for sponsoring MVP/MIP
