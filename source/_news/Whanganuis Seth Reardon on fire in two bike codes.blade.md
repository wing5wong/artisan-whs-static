<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Twice as much race time on his bike is translating into multiple successes for Whanganui Yamaha ace Seth Reardon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The just-turned 21-year-old is currently running with the leaders in two very different bike disciplines and, with races still to be run in both the separate competitions, he fancies his chances of tasting even more glory before the year is out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reardon took his 2019-model Yamaha YZ250FX to finish overall runner-up at the second round of four in this year's New Zealand Cross-country Championships near Mosgiel on Sunday and that result, added to his fourth placing at the series opener near Norsewood in February, has boosted him into the No.2 spot in the title chase.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">And, riding the same bike, the apprentice engineer is a also running fifth overall in the New Zealand Enduro Championships after the first of seven rounds in Whangamata just over a week ago, that series sponsored by Yamaha.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it is Raglan's Jason Dickey who leads the cross-country nationals and, with only three of the four rounds to be counted &mdash; riders to discard their one worst result &mdash; it means there is really only a slim chance that Reardon can snatch then title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All the same, Reardon reckons he'd be thrilled with an overall runner-up finish in the cross-country nationals &mdash; it would be a career-best result for him.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He attributes his recent successes to hard work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been looking good for me this season," said Reardon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have been training very hard this year and it's paying off. I'm in the gym every day and spend lots of time on the bike, riding Wednesdays and at the weekends.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't know why I've been going so well ... I've had no problems; the bike is awesome, so reliable; my fitness is the best it's ever been; I've been practicing my starts a lot ... it all helps.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I got a good start at Mosgiel on Sunday. I was in about third position into turn one, but then eight riders cut me off at the third marker peg, cutting the course, and that dropped me back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a bit of karma just after that because a bunch of them got stuck in a mud bog and I just chose a better line and scooted back past them again and was up to third place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had a great battle with (Raglan's) Brandon Given throughout the race as we fought over the runner-up spot ... Jason Dickey was long gone by then. Dickey is on fire at the moment, but I was happy to finish second. That's my best result at the nationals."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 90-minute junior race at Mosgiel on Sunday was won by Eltham's defending national junior champion Adam Loveridge, with the round one winner from Raglan, Coby Rooks, this time accepting second place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Taupo Yamaha rider Wil Yeoman completed the junior podium at Mosgiel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will be little rest now for Reardon especially, the double championship campaigner preparing now for round two of the enduro nationals on the Kapiti Coast on Saturday, April 6, and then round three of the cross-country nationals in Marlborough on Sunday, April 14.</p>
