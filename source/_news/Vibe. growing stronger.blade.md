<p class="element element-paragraph">The vibe. music festival is returning to Cooks Gardens this year to kick start summer on the right note.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>New Zealand rapper and producer Kings will headline the December 15 event with nomad returning to Whanganui after leading last year's line up.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui District Council Youth Committee-run festival debuted in 2017 and organiser, WHS student<strong> Josie Verhaaren</strong> said there was "definitely" enough success to build a bigger and better event this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Earlybird tickets went on sale on Monday afternoon for a day of entertainment which includes performances from local acts <strong>Late Night Tales</strong>&nbsp;(past/present WHS students), Whenua Patuwai,<strong> Ra Costelloe </strong>(former WHS student),<strong> The Remnant</strong>&nbsp;(WHS students / Regional&nbsp;<span>Rockquest band winners 2018)&nbsp;</span>and dance crew Aotea Empire.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Vibe. mixes music and entertainment with a focus on youth mental health, with a portion of all tickets sales from the non-profit event going to Youthline - which received a $4500 donation last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Green Party MP Chl&ouml;e Swarbrick will speak about mental health while social agencies will be on site to offer information and support.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will also be food trucks on site but people are still able to bring their own food.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Verhaaren said she hoped the festival would remove some of the stigma around mental health and asking for help.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">About 400 tickets were sold to last year's event but she was hoping to sell least 1000 to vibe. 2018.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been really nice to have some of the ground work in place. Last year it was done completely from scratch and we had no prior experience."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Tickets are available through eventfinda or at the Whanganui i-Site.<br />Earlybird tickets are $10 or $25 for a family pass and available until November 5.</strong><br /><strong>From then tickets will be $15 or $35 for a family pass.</strong></p>
