<p class="element element-paragraph">Christmas Day rain made way for more summer-like weather just in time for Whanganui's famous Cemetery Circuit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual motorbike street races in central Whanganui drew another good Boxing Day crowd which was treated to plenty of thrills and spills on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One of the younger fans at the track was 3-year-old Jed Bartley who found a good spot along the finishing straight in what was already his second Cemetery Circuit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He loves anything with motorbikes and loud noises - anything with wheels," his father said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">People perched themselves on trucks, banks and anywhere they could get a view around the circuit's straights and bends as they settled in for a day of racing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A group parked up at the intersection of Wilson St and Ridgway St had a prime spot for the crashes which delayed some of the early races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The group of friends have been coming to their "VIP" spot - complete with grandstand and a barbecue - for about 20 years to watch the bikes.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />"You get the start line, you get the first two corners and you get the finish so everyone likes it," Brodie Carrick said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A lot of our friends race as well. It's just a tradition for us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At the Cemetery Circuit merchandise tent, Millie Prince was selling souvenir T-shirts to punters.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Staff there said numbers were a bit down early on but Tuesday's weather may have delayed people's decision to turn up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While racing wrapped up around 5pm, the fun continued with British DJ Carl Cox - who had a team racing at Cemetery Circuit - playing at Frank Bar later that night.</p>
