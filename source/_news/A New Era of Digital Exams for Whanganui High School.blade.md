<p>Tēnā koutou,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Year 11 to Year 13 students began their respective NCEA Level 1 to 3 examinations last Thursday, while our Year 9 and Year 10 students completed their Junior examinations earlier this week. Of special significance in the Junior examinations is the fact that each examination (English, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies) was partially, or fully, digitally completed by all students. This puts Whanganui High School right at the cutting-edge of assessment readiness within New Zealand secondary schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, 17<sup>th</sup> November, we are hosting the Central Six Junior tournament. The Central Six schools include Whanganui High School and five other schools similar in size to us who we compete and collaborate with on a regular basis throughout the year: Freyberg High School; Taradale High School; Havelock North High School; Kapiti College and Tawa College.</p>

<p>Recently our 1<sup>st</sup> XI Boys Cricket team won the Central Districts Ross Taylor T20 Trophy final against Feilding High.&nbsp; Congratulations to the team and we look forward to continued successes next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sports being played on Friday are; Boys&rsquo; Cricket, Girls&rsquo; and Boys&rsquo; Volleyball, Badminton; Athletics and Touch.&nbsp; All events begin at 10.00am. Cricket and Touch at Springvale Park; Volleyball in Jubilee Stadium; Badminton in Springvale Stadium and Athletics at Cooks Gardens. You are very welcome to attend and support our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are still intending to enroll your daughter or son at Whanganui High School next year, I urge you to do so as quickly as possible. We currently have a limited number of places available for 2018.&nbsp;</p>
