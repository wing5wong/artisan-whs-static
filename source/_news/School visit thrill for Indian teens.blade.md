<p><strong>CULTURAL EXCHANGE: Students from&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Indraprastha International School with their homestay "siblings" from Whanganui High School.</strong><br />PHOTO: Stuart Munro</span></p>
<p>Seven Indian students who spent two weeks experiencing life in Whanganui were farewelled at an afternoon tea on Friday.</p>
<p>The students, from Indraprastha International School in the Indian capital, New Delhi, have been taking classes at Whanganui High School, visiting Mt Ruapehu and taking part in a number of creative and cultural activities.</p>
<p>The students - who were here with their deputy principal, Shalini Jain - were the first exchange students from India that Whanganui High School has hosted. They stayed with homestay families while they were in Whanganui.</p>
<p>Mrs Jain said everyone had had a wonderful time.</p>
<p>"The students have become well-connected to their homestay families, and the culture exchange has been beautiful.</p>
<p>Mrs Jain said some of the students are thinking seriously about coming back to New Zealand.</p>
<p>"They may come back in a year or two, or they may look at coming to university in New Zealand," she said.</p>
<p>The trip has been such as success that she hopes the relationship with Whanganui High School will be permanent, and that a group of students from Indraprastha International School would visit Whanganui every year.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School's international director, Alexandra Ferreti, said it had been "great fun" hosting the Year 10 students at the school.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing them again - hopefully some for a more long-term basis."</p>
