Day two: the girls had a massive day today playing 3 games. The team started the day playing Wellington high school. It was a really close match but unfortunately the girls lost 2 sets to 1. The team then played Waikato dio and Inglewood, winning both games. An awesome day for the team, persevering and coming away with their first wins of the tournament!
