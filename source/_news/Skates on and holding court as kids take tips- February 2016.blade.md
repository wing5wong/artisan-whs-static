<p>LISTEN UP: Whanganui's former NBL Nelson Giant &amp; International Impact camp player Akira Marsters (former WHS student) addresses the hopefuls preparing for Whanganui representative basketball yesterday.</p>
<p>It was summer camp for sporting juniors on both sides of the Springvale and Jubilee Stadium carparks yesterday as basketballers and roller skaters alike picked up tips from the best local minds in their codes.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Basketball Association was running its first open training session to put together up to seven girls' and boys' teams to play representative basketball at the Mel Young Classic in Tauranga and Rotorua over Easter Weekend. They will train over the next three Sundays so the five coaches can get an idea on everyone's level before announcing their teams for the tournament.</p>
<p>One of the coaches, Paul Berridge, was delighted with the turnout of around 37 players from under-11 through to under-19 level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the way the River City Rollers were giving lessons to about 15 girls on the finer points of roller skating in the first of their six Sunday camps.</p>
<p>Overseen by former New Zealand player Mel McGhie, the children were being taught basic movement skills like going down to one knee and stopping.</p>
<p>The Rollers club hopes to return to competitive games this year, playing six including two at home. The first game will be at Jubilee Stadium in March.</p>
