<p><strong>Summer of Success for WHS</strong> - Wanganui Secondary School News - River City Press 20/4/17</p>
<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,</p>
<p>During the final week of the term, we held four very successful mixed year level Achievers&rsquo; assemblies. Students joined together to celebrate the academic, cultural, service and sporting successes of our students since the beginning of the school year. As I also explained during the assemblies, it gave students a little taste of a future House structure format I will be bringing in for 2018. At a later stage this year, I will seek contributions from our students, parents and the wider school community regarding suggestions for four House names of lasting significance to our school and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had an action-packed Summer Tournament week with 10 teams competing throughout the North Island in Softball, Volleyball, 3x3 Basketball, Waka Ama, Rowing and Ultimate Frisbee. The week was a successful one for all teams, with some podium finishes and strong performances on and off the field, court, water and pitch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eleven students competed at the North Island Secondary School Athletics Championships. Our team broke five school records over the weekend with standout performances by Rebecca Baker in breaking two records. Other individual record breakers were Travis Bayler, Maysin Katene and Sophie Andrews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the recent National Swimming Meet, Sarya Lower won five medals, including a NZ title - the best individual effort by a Whanganui High School swimmer in recent history. Alex Forlong and Niamh Hogan were amongst the top 10 placings in their respective events. Our kayakers enjoyed outstanding success in the recent Kayaking Marathon Nationals where they received national titles and placings in their respective events. Congratulations to Liam Lace, Anna Clifton, Lucas Thompson and Jack Clifton.</p>
<p>Tickets for our school production of the Broadway smash hit <em>Rock of Ages</em> are now available at the Royal Whanganui Opera House and are selling quickly. The show runs from 10<sup>th</sup> &ndash; 13<sup>th</sup> May, and gives our students the opportunity to showcase their talents to our community. This will be a show not to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui<br />Martin McAllen<br />Principal</p>
