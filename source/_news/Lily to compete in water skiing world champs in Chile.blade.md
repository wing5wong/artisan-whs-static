<p><strong><span>(PHOTO CREDIT - STEVE CAUDWELL)</span><br />WHS student Lily Meade to compete in water skiing world champs in Chile.</strong></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Lily Meade&rsquo;s success at water skiing was perhaps inevitable. Her father loved the sport, her older brother is also into it and when Lily was only three, the family built a house right next to Lake Wiritoa.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">But Lily didn&rsquo;t start skiing till she was 11 &ndash; and then she took to it like a duck to water. Five months after, she competed at the Nationals and gained a second and a fourth in the under 14 girls events. Her father and brother became her coaches and the next year, Lily got a first in the Nationals. Earlier this year as a 16 year old she competed in the under 17 category and came first in all three events she competed in and also won the overall title. She was one of six female skiers to qualify for Open Women&rsquo;s and achieved a second and a fourth. Currently she is the number one in the under 17 girls category in all of the events.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">In 2014 she was selected to compete in the U17 World Championships which was to be held in the Ukraine but because of the difficulties there it was delayed a year and transferred to Peru. She says that &ldquo;although I didn&rsquo;t get into the medals, I loved the experience and the high standard of competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Lily has been selected to compete in the under 17 World Championships in Chile in January 2017. She is part of a team of six and the international requirement is that at least two of the team have to be girls. She says &ldquo;the intention is that although girls compete only against other girls, the requirement will encourage countries to put as much effort into promoting girls water skiing as they do for boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">You have to be of a suitable standard to qualify for the championships. In the slalom you have to pass around six (full course) buoys at a minimum speed of 52 kph. For tricks you have to achieve 2000 points. She explain one of them &ldquo;a toe 7&rdquo; which is worth 450 points. &ldquo;You hold the rope with your foot and circle around as you haul the rope in. You have to do it all quickly as you are allowed only two runs lasting 20 seconds each.&rdquo; A flip is harder and is worth 500 points.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">In the jump event you have to achieve at least 20 metres. Lily puts it into context by explaining &ldquo;the world record is 78 metres&rdquo; There is a risk in the sport. Lily explains that her boat speed is about 51 kph but because of her movement on the water, she travels at around 70kph. She has canned out &ldquo;but haven&rsquo;t really hurt myself. I did cut the corner too late and ended up sliding off the side of the ramp once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">She is now being coached by New Zealander, Kyle Eade, who broke his neck, when competing overseas. It was feared he would never walk again but now operates his coaching practice in Orlanda, Florida.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Lily has been going each July for a month since she was 12 to be coached by Kyle, having enough maturity to fly by herself. With the World Championships coming up in January, she is going for three months this time, before returning home in October, to resume summer training here. Even though the water and the air temperatures have been cold over the past month or so, Lily has continued training, as long as there is a family member to drive the ski boat. In summer she normally trains twice a day.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">She has received support from Whanganui Future Champions Trust with a grant and considering she needs to take at least six skis with her when she travels, travelling expenses can mount up.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Lily is still a student at Wanganui High School doing level 2 NCEA. She says that &ldquo;most of my subjects are arts based such as Art Design and Photography and I can do much of the work outside of school.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">In the longer term, she is hoping to gain a sports&rsquo; scholarship in an American university, which will allow her to combine skiing with study. She says &ldquo;I am particularly interested in the University of Louisiana in Monroe as they offer scholarships and have a water skiing team.&rdquo; Her results in January will be crucial.</p>
