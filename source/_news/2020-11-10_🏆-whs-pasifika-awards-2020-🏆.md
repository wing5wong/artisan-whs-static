The 2020 WHS Pasifika Awards was a colourful, joyous occasion celebrating our Pasifika students.   

It was hosted by our Heads of Pasifika for 2020, Dennihe Edwards and Jacob Brown, who did a fabulous job.

We were very privileged to have Sosoli Tawadalua (nee Tofu) as our guest speaker who talked about her journey from Whanganui High School to becoming a Black Fern Women Rugby Representative.  She spoke of how following her dreams helped to inspire others around her.

There was lots of entertainment including singing and Pasifika dancing. A Taualuga was performed by our Year 13 leavers to end off this wonderful evening, which included parents and family members joining in.

##### Our Prestigious awards of the night went to:

**Outstanding Contribution to Pasifika, Junior – Seini Baleinukulala**  
**Outstanding contribution to Pasifika, Senior – Matavesi Lewenilovo** 
**Pasifika Bowl for Academic Excellence – Leah Aiono**   
**Seunu’u Mau Leleimalefaga Memorial Trophy for Pasifika Leadership, Female – Dennihe Edwards**  
**Seunu’u Mau Leleimalefaga Memorial Trophy for Pasifika Leadership, Male – Jacob Brown**  

Congratulations to you and all of our recipients who made this night so special.
