<p><strong>FIGHTING FIT: Whanganui siblings Callaghan (left) and Keightley Watson (WHS student) return triumphant from Australian judo tournament, including NZ selection for Keightley.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whanganui teenager Keightley Watson will become the fourth of his family to represent New Zealand when he competes at the upcoming Oceania Judo Tournament in Tonga.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 15-year-old made the New Zealand team after winning silver and gold at the ACT Judo International in Canberra over the weekend.</strong></p>
<p>He joins uncle Wayne Watson and cousins Daniel and Kasey as a New Zealand representative. However, he will be the first Watson to represent New Zealand in two divisions at the same time.</p>
<p>Keightley and his younger brother Callaghan arrived back from Australia with great results.</p>
<p>Keightley fought in the Cadets (15-17-year-old + 90kg) division and took silver then stepped up to the Young men's 100+ weight division (under 21) were he took the gold medal.</p>
<p>Eleven-year-old Callaghan, fighting in Australia for the first time, won bronze in the senior boys (11 years to 14) under 60kg weight division.</p>
<p>International events are open to individuals and clubs, so do not count as country of origin representative tournaments.</p>
<p>The tournament held at Tuggeranong Canberra also doubled as the Australian qualification event for the Oceania Judo Tournament in Tonga.</p>
<p>With near on 500 judokas competing, including a team from the Hong Kong national squad, the ACT tournament was bigger than the Australian national tournament.&nbsp;<br />Keightley and Callaghan now have a 10-day turn-around before competing in the 2017 Queensland International Open on the Gold Coast which will also play part of the Australian OJU qualification for their players, so again will have large numbers of competitors seeking selection.</p>
<p>Keightley's ACT performances gained him selection for the New Zealand judo team to fight at the Ocean Tournament in both the Cadets +90kg and Young Mens +100kg which are to held in Tonga at the back end of April.</p>
<p>Two other Whanganui Judokas from the Wanganui City College Judo Club, Finn Brown (in both the Young Men's &amp; Seniors Men's) and Liam Goodall (Young Men's) have also been selected to represent New Zealand at the Oju.</p>
<p>Keightley may also be competing in the Asian Open International back-to-back tournaments to be held in Hong Kong and Taipei in July this year. He is just awaiting confirmation that New Zealand will be sending teams.</p>
