<p><span>MORE GLORY: &nbsp;WHS student,&nbsp;Whanganui's Ashlee Barlow and her ageing mare Phoenician Poem add to their Horse of the Year title after winning the Supreme National Junior Riding title at the Horse and Pony Show in Feilding last week.</span></p>
<p>WHANGANUI horses and riders continued to keep the River City on the equine map with success at the annual New Zealand National Horse and Pony Show at Manfield Park in Feilding last week.</p>
<p>Racehorse trainer JJ Rayner produced her thoroughbred To The Max to win the Supreme Champion Riding Horse national title with Paula Glasgow from Turakina aboard, while 14-year-old Ashlee Barlow claimed the Supreme National Junior Riding title on her pony Phoenician Poem as well as the runner-up Reserve Champion Newcomer with Raptures Unforgettable.</p>
<p>Rayner said To The Max had raced 16 times as Aladdin Prince both here and in Hong Kong for three wins and numerous placings for just over $70,000 in stake money.</p>
<p>The now 8-year-old had revealed his liking for show horse work when third in the Rising Stars class at last year's Horse of the Year Show in Hastings with Rayner in the saddle.</p>
<p>"Show horse is similar to a dog show in many ways, I guess," Rayner said yesterday.</p>
<p>"The horses are judged on conformation, manners and movement during a workout similar to dressage. It takes a bit to get horses to this level, especially for an ex-racehorse. It's a completely different world for them, but Max has adapted very well.</p>
<p>"I was a bit busy to ride him this year, so Paula was happy to stand in and she's done a wonderful job. We will head back to he Horse of the Year again in March," she said.</p>
<p>Barlow was delighted to win her title, although she still cherishes her Paced and Mannered Supreme Champion Show Pony in their class title she won on Phoencian Poem at the Horse of the Year last season.</p>
<p>"That's a bigger show so it's probably still my biggest performance yet. I have only had Raptures Unforgettable a relatively short time, but has come along nicely. We will be taking both ponies to the Horse of the Year, so it's going to be busy," Barlow said.</p>
<p>A number of other Whanganui equestrians competed at Manfield Park finishing in behind the placegetters.</p>
