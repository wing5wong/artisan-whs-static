<p><span><span>Congratulations to the U19 boys and girls rugby sevens squads for some great performances on the weekend in Taranaki. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Girls won v Patea 24-10, v Opunake 32-0, and narrowly against second-ranked Taranaki team Sacred Heart 22-19. Played their heart out, but there wasn't enough left in the tank for the final against New Plymouth GHS, going down 8 tries to nil. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boys, who have already qualified for nationals, had losses against NPBHS and Hawera, and good wins against Inglewood and Palmerston North Boys' High School.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Well done, you gave your all!</span></p>
