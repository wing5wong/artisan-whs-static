<p>WHS student Jessica Watkin was on fire with the bat for the Central Districts Under 21's in their eight run win over Canterbury in round 3 of the national tournament on Saturday.</p>
<p>Playing on the No2 pitch at Auckland's Lloyd Elsmore Park, captain Watkin stroked 127 not out off 100 balls to guide her team to an imposing 302-3 in their 50 overs.</p>
<p>Watkin struck 19 boundaries and a six in the innings.</p>
<p>Canterbury gave a hard chase but were ultimately short at 294-8, despite an extraordinary 173 not out from 137 balls by No3 batter Allie Mace-Cochrane.</p>
<p>Watkin took two wickets to finish with 2-62 from her ten overs of spin.</p>
<p>Central Districts are playing Auckland today</p>
