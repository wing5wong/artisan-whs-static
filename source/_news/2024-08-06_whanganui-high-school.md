Battle of the Pans

A very early start to the day, lots of cake boxes plus three students anxiously anticipating having to cook in unfamiliar surroundings whilst being judged by chefs sums up the day of the Battle of the Pans. This year it was hosted by Aotea College and we took our largest number of students competitors yet. The static cupcake class is always popular. The cakes are prepared the day before and taken to be judged as are the café cakes. Olivia Cox Year 13 won this class, gaining a silver medal, with her lemon, thyme and rosemary cakes. Jocelyn Mayer Year 13 also gained a silver for her cherry cupcakes.

In the cupcakes Madelyn Connole Year 13, Amaliah Pohio Year 12, Mona Romer Year 12, Lauren King Year 12 all won bronze medals.

In the café cake class Olivia Cox and Madelyn Connole gain silver and bronze medals.

In the hot kitchen pasta class Olivia won silver with a broccoli dish.

In the hot kitchen café sandwich class Olivia won silver with a smoked chicken sourdough sandwich, Lilly Cairncross Year 13 silver with a steak and hollandaise sandwich and Jocelyn Mayer Year 13 won the class with a gold medal for a sausage and pickle sandwich.

Well done to everyone involved!
