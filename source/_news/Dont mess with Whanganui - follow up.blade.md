<p><span>Congratulations to Tony Sundman, Youth Work Coordinator for YMCA Central who led a group (including WHS student Tamara Johnson - right of photo) clean-up of G.F. Moore Drive next to the YMCA. He advises that their next plan is to plant trees.</span></p>
<p><span>Also congratulations to Sonya who lives on Durie Hill. She would pick up litter on the zig zag down the hill as she walked to UCOL. This time she went armed with buckets and says, &ldquo;I wasn't expecting to collect much so I was surprised how much I found in half an hour.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Councillor, Rob Vinsen, advises that &ldquo;the Whanganui District Council offers a monthly collection of all recyclables to elderly without transport and the physically impaired. Phone 349 0001.</span></p>
