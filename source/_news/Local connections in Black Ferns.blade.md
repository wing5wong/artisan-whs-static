<p><span><strong>Former Whanganui High School pupil Sosoli Talawadua (nee Tofa)</strong> and f</span>ormer Whanganui Girls' College physical education head Kristina Sue have retained their spots in the Black Ferns.</p>
<p>Sue, who lives and plays club rugby in Manawatu, and Talawadua, based in Waikato, has been included in coach Glenn Moore's 31-strong squad to prepare to face Canada, Australia and England in June.</p>
<p>Both made their debuts on the Black Ferns tour of England and Ireland in mid-November.</p>
<p>They each have significant sporting pedigree as Sue previously represented New Zealand in touch rugby, sevens rugby, nines league and the full NZ Women's league team.</p>
<p><strong>Talawadua comes from a strong Whanganui sporting family, being the sister of NZ Heartland XV and Steelform Wanganui prop Viki Tofa.</strong></p>
<p>Moore said the majority of the players named were likely to form the Women's Rugby World Cup squad.</p>
<p>"While the World Cup is the pinnacle event we have three very important home tests.</p>

<p>"Players are very excited about it and the home tests are an opportunity for us to try some of the things against the same opposition we will face at World Cup, without showing too much."</p>
<p><strong>The Black Ferns play Canada at Westpac Stadium on June 9, Australia at Rugby Park in Christchurch on June 13, then England at Rotorua International Stadium on June 17.</strong></p>
