<p><span>FOR THE LOVE OF IT: Flautist Ingrid Culliford and pianist Liam Wooding <span>(former Wanganui High School student)&nbsp;</span>will be performing this weekend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"For the love of it" is exactly the reason that flautist Ingrid Culliford and pianist Liam Wooding have put together a richly varied programme of music for flute and piano, and solo piano which they will present in the Concert Chamber of the Memorial Hall this Sunday, at 4pm.</p>
<p>Lasting a little over an hour, the concert programme journeys from the extroverted and melodious Sonata in D by Beethoven's contemporary, Hummel, across a French landscape, including Sonatine by Dutilleux, and works for solo piano by Debussy (L'Isle Joyeuse, and La Cathedrale Engloutie) as well as the celebration of birdsong in Messaien's Le Merle Noir. To complete the programme, the duo will finish with the Prokofiev Sonata for Flute and Piano, one of the major works in the repertoire.</p>
<p>Since completing his degree in piano performance at the University of Auckland in 2013, Liam has been in demand as a soloist, accompanist and ensemble player. Earlier this year he was awarded third place in the National Concerto Competition in Christchurch. He has performed locally as soloist and accompanist and most recently was one of the instrumentalists in residence at the annual CANZ Nelson Composers Workshops.</p>
<p>Liam is about to embark on a Post-Graduate Diploma in Music at the University of Waikato and has recently progressed to the second round of auditions for the Australian National Academy of Music in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Before returning to NZ in 1994, Ingrid pursued a freelance career in London as a flautist, performing in many different ensembles and orchestras and touring in both Europe and the Americas. She has continued to perform throughout New Zealand, has worked as a casual extra with the NZSO and is a recording artist for Radio New Zealand.</p>
<p>It is with great pleasure and just "for the love of it" that Ingrid and Liam present this programme. From the proceeds, a donation will be made to the Mayoral Relief Fund.</p>
<p>Tickets available at the door, adults $20, students $5.</p>
