<p class="element element-paragraph">A United Nations (UN) delegation took place at Whanganui Girls' College yesterday to tackle big issues such as nuclear weapons and peaceful use of outer space.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Six schools attended the junior model UN conference - among them were; Nga Tawa, Whanganui Intermediate, Whanganui City College, Wanganui Collegiate, Whanganui Girls' College and Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">From French berets to Mexican sombreros and ponchos each team dressed accordingly to the country they were representing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">From 10.30am to 2.30pm delegates had three topics to discuss; total elimination of nuclear weapons, international co-operation in the peaceful use of outer space and the safety of journalists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And not only did they have to dress the part but they also had to play it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Students had researched the topic prior to the conference and each country was given one minute speaking time to debate each topic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui branch president of the United Nations Association, Kate Smith, said it was a challenge because they had speak from the point of view of the country they were representing and be careful not to give their own opinion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We tried to keep it formal to give a taste of what the real thing would be like."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's junior mock United Nations conference has been running for 18 years but Ms Smith said this was the most colourful conference yet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The students went to a real effort with costumes this year - the Netherlands team had made their own yellow clogs which was pretty impressive."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each team prepared national dishes of their country they were representing and the food was shared during lunch interval.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Students were also rewarded for their delegations with a certificate and a block of Trade Aid chocolate.</p>
