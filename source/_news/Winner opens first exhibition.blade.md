<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Mikayla Baldwin's art featured on the cover of the Whanganui Artist's Open Studio Guide this year and now there will be an opportunity to see more of her work.</strong></p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui High School student will open her first solo exhibition at Whanganui Fine Arts Gallery on June 15.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The exhibition is the culmination of six months work since Baldwin was awarded the first Young Artist Scholarship by the Whanganui Fine Arts Collective in November last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are extremely proud to be hosting Mikayla's first solo exhibition and her work demonstrates a maturity that is beyond her years," says collective member Jim Norris.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baldwin has been mentored by collective member Lindsay Marsh to prepare for the exhibition and <strong>Whanganui High School art teacher Graham Hall</strong> has continued to encourage her artistic development.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young artist has said she loves non-conformist ideology which she uses to produce her charming portraits of animals, fruit and vegetables clad in classic human apparel.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />"I love creating surrealistic work and letting the viewers interpret each piece their own way," says the 17-year-old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"<strong>Graham Hall</strong> has taught me the technique of drypoint etching and encouraged me to develop the technique."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Baldwin was awarded the main $1000 prize last year and also managed to scoop the people's choice prize of $200.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Fine Arts Gallery, established in 2015, has a commitment to fostering emerging talent as part of their mission statement.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual scholarship was launched last year with support from the Whanganui District Council and the 2018 winner will be announced at the exhibition opening which is also a celebration of Whanganui Fine Arts' third birthday.</p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Mikayla Baldwin's exhibition will be open for public viewing at 17 Taupo Quay from June 16.</h4>
