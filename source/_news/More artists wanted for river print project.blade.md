<p>Print maker and WHS teacher, Graham Hall is putting together 20 metre wood cut print of the Whanganui River.</p>
<p>Print maker Graham Hall wants your interpretation of the Whanganui River.</p>
<p>The Whanganui man in putting together a 20 metre wood cut print which depicts the entire length of the 290km river - from the mountain to the sea.</p>
<p>Mr Hall has carved the path of the river into 42 panels which join together.</p>
<p>Each panel will now be carved by a different artist with their own interpretation of the surrounds corresponding with section of river they have chosen.</p>
<p>Mr Hall has been working on the project for most of the year and is now ready to hand out panels to participants.</p>
<p>"I think I was probably looking at how I could raise printing awareness in Whanganui," he said. "And the river seemed the perfect thing to do.</p>
<p>"I don't think [print] will ever die but it's a process that's not so common these days."</p>
<p>Mr Hill has about 22 people already signed up to do a panel but he needs 20 more.</p>
<p>"The idea is that they need to do a bit of research on the area they have chosen," he said.</p>
<p>"We'll get a cross section of people - we've got young students, established print makers and artists. It's an inclusive process."</p>
<p>Workshops will also be held for those involved in carving a panel.</p>
<p>Mr Hall said the piece would be printed on a press before a public event where it will be pressed with a road roller on November 26.</p>
<p>"That'll be an event itself and we'll have no idea how it will turn out on the day."</p>
<p>He said he hadn't decided on where the print would be displayed but had a few ideas, such as the iSite.</p>
<p>He also wanted to exhibit it at a gallery.</p>
<p>Mr Hall received funding from the Whanganui District Creative Communities Scheme for the project.</p>
<p>"Because I've never done anything like this before it's been a bit of a learning curve."</p>
<p>People can register to do a panel at www.whanganuiriverprint.com.</p>
