Huge congratulations to **Charlotte Hagan** and two other students from Palmerston North Girls High who were crowned; **123 Digital Technologies National Challenge winners for 2020, Secondary Level.**  It was an on-line presentation due to Covid, hosted by Suzy Cato late last year.

The Challenge was to Design and Create an App.  Their very impressive winning entry was a 1st Aid App with visual aids to help people understand how to properly perform CPR and save lives in emergency situations.

**Fantastic effort girls!!**  
They have only recently received their trophies and medals.
