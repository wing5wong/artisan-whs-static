<p class="element element-paragraph">The young folk of Whanganui have a message for the rest of us - wake up, climate change is real and we need to do more than we are.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fynn Rees, 16, is planning to take part in a global student strike next week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rees was a young girl when she learned about climate change and her introduction to the hot topic was quite unorthodox.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She is from a younger generation who have been able to educate themselves using various resources online.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One such resource was the annual letter from Microsoft billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rees was particularly interested in a letter containing statistics on causes of climate change which noted that agriculture produces 24 per cent of greenhouse gasses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A note added to the letter said that if cattle were a country, it would rank third in greenhouse emissions at 5.0 behind China at 10.2 and USA at 5.3.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rees will be attending the Whanganui School Strike 4 Climate, which is scheduled to take place at the punch bowl at Virginia Lake on March 15 starting at 10am.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That's a Friday, meaning students wanting to strike will have to skip some classes at school or miss a day altogether to support the cause.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rees said it is a worthy one and people who deny climate changes and things like global warming need a wake-up call.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is hard for me because my grandma doesn't really care about it, but I think they're a little bit living in denial and a little bit living in the present," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It doesn't matter to them now and they don't think they're going to be around when it really matters. To them it's like 'it's not my problem, I don't need to worry about it'".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">School Strike 4 Climate is a global event known by different names around the world that started due to the actions of a Swedish girl named Greta Thunberg.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On August 20 2018, Thunberg decided not to attend school until the Swedish general election on September 9 following heat waves and wildfires in Sweden.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Thunberg was 15 at the time and demanded that the Swedish government reduces carbon emissions, protesting by sitting outside the Riksdag with a sign every day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her actions inspired many, including Youth MP for Whanganui Ali Gammeter who got involved when asked by national co-ordinator Sophie Handford.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gammeter said there was strong support for the strike on the Whanganui - School Strike 4 Climate Facebook page and is expecting the event to pack a punch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If students aren't turning up to school, that sends a pretty strong message, especially if we get support from politicians as well," Gammeter said.<span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It doesn't matter what your political affiliations are, this is an issue that is going to have really bad consequences for my generation."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gammeter was working on arranging live music for the strike, as well as approaching some confident students to stand up and speak to their peers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All secondary school students are invited to participate in the strike, but the event has certainly received mixed reactions from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12209586" target="_blank">politicians</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12207500" target="_blank">principals</a>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Principals are still deciding how to manage student involvement in the strike.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cullinane College principal Justin Harper said classes will run as usual on the day of the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If we cancel those classes then we effectively undermine the notion of a strike," Harper said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If the students want to protest and strike, they'll need to choose that option against attending the classes they will have scheduled."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cullinane College has a regular system of checking attendance and students not in class would be processed through that system as usual.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Harper said it was clear to him that a significant number of students are passionate about the cause and that the notion of a strike was important.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This means that the students are exercising their right to protest for a cause that they feel passionately about," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I respect the notions of peaceful protest and for young adults to learn that their voice is valuable."</p>
