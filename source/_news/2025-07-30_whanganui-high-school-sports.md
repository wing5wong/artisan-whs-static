Well done to Lucas Munn and congratulations on your medal and placings. 

That's a wrap for the JNZ Development Squad tour of Hong Kong and Macau! Lucas had a fantastic tour, competing and training alongside a truly international group, including athletes from Chinese Taipei, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Mongolia, to name a few. He brought home a Bronze medal from Hong Kong, placed 5th in Macau, and now holds an IJF world ranking of 60th in the world for his age bracket.
