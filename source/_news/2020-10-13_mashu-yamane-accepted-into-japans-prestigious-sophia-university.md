Congratulations Mashu Yamane for being accepted into Sophia University, one of the top private research universities in Japan!  

We are proud of you and of everyone else sitting entrance examinations at the moment.  It is always challenging to test ourselves but we don't know what we are capable of until we try.

Good luck to you all from your International team at WHS. ðŸ˜Š
