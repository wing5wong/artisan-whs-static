<p>The music department was approached by Wanganui Hospice to provide bands to play at a fireworks display for their annual fundraising event on Saturday 16 September.</p>
<p>Little did we know we would be playing on the back of a huge truck in front of thousands? The cold weather did not deter us and the students had a taste of what it is like to gig in front of a massive audience &ndash; You can&rsquo;t teach that stuff in the classroom.</p>
<p>We were very proud to be part of this event and we have already been booked for next year!</p>
