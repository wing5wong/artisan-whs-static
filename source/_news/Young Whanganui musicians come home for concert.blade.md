<p><strong>HOME CONCERT: Cellist Elena Morgan (left) and pianist Max Munneke (right) will perform a mix of modern music and masterpieces next Saturday 22 July at the Whanganui War Memorial Concert Chamber.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Music Society is happy to be able to welcome home two young musicians currently studying at Waikato University.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cellist Elena Morgan and pianist Max Munneke will play at a concert hosted by the society on July 22.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Elena is the recipient of our Kenrick Christie Award for 2013 and Max received the same award in 2014," said society president Christine Soulsby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The award is for students who are going on to study music in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is a source of great pride when our award students return to perform for us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other Whanganui musicians who have taken part in concerts for the society include <strong>Liam Wooding </strong>(photo below), who received the Kenrick Christie award in 2010, Pascal Harris and Hannah-Elizabeth Teoh.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Morgan</strong> is in her fourth year of tertiary studies, currently studying towards a Bachelor of Music Performance with honours under James Tennant at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She previously completed her undergraduate years at the NZ School of Music in Wellington where she studied cello with Inbal Megiddo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Morgan</strong> has been awarded several scholarships including the Wynne Costley Study Award, Whanganui Music Society Kenrick Christie Award, Mitre 10 Gilbertson Young Achievers Award, and a Victoria University Excellence scholarship</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She hopes to continue with study towards a masters degree and explore opportunities overseas.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Munneke</strong> began playing piano when he started at Whanganui High School aged 12.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His love for music got him through the New Zealand Board music exams with the support of his teachers Win Livesay and Ingrid Culliford.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In his final year of high school it became apparent that music would be a viable option for study at a tertiary institution and he completed his AMus diploma in 2014.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 2015 Munneke was awarded the Sir Edmund Hillary Scholarship to study with pianist Katherine Austin at the Waikato University Conservatorium of Music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year <strong>Munneke</strong> has been awarded the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Exchange Scholarship and plans to study in Beijing, China for four months commencing early September.</p>
