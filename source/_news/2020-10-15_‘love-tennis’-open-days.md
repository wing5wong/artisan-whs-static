The Wanganui Tennis Club, at the back of City College, is having open days this weekend from 1 to 4pm and “everyone is welcome.” Dave Butters has been playing tennis since he was 15 and says “it will be a fun event for all ages.” When pressed he narrowed it down to anyone between 3 and 103!

Tennis racquets will be supplied if you don’t have one, so all you need to do is to wear sandshoes/sneakers and comfortable clothing. There is no need to be shy as there will be ‘greeters’ to welcome you, an M.C. telling everyone where to go and when and there will be plenty of signage. 

There are a number of attractions with a free Hells Pizza voucher for the first 200 families who come. You can bribe the kids with a balloon or two and later on with the BBQ. The fun activities, Dave explains, “include a speed radar to tell who has the fastest serve, a competition to hit the most balls into a bucket and returning the balls from a ball machine. (The speed can be turned down on request). There are a number of prizes as well, including a travel prize to Te Anau.

If you are new to tennis or are returning to the game, which Dave describes as “a fun sport for life,” you may wish to join the club and/or to learn how to play better. On Thursdays from 6 to 7pm there will be a free ‘Back to Tennis’ programme. There will also be a special membership offer as well – 50% discount on an annual membership available only this weekend.

Kyle Butters (ex WHS student), Dave’s son and national tennis champion at a variety of levels, will be one of the volunteer coaches there on the weekend. Dave has another proud family boast – his niece is Whanganui local, Paige Hourigan, who is currently in the USA playing in professional tennis tournaments.
