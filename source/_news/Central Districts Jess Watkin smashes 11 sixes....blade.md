<p><strong>Wellington's bowlers had no answer to Central Districts' Jess Watkin who clobbered 200 off 123 balls at the national under-21 tournament in Auckland.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Central Districts' (and former WHS student) Jess Watkin smashes 11 sixes in double-century at national under-21 tourney.</strong></p>
<p>Star White Ferns legspinner Amelia Kerr was among the bowlers carted by Central Districts' Jess Watkin who hit a stunning double-century in the national women's under-21 cricket tournament in Auckland.</p>
<p>Watkin, Central's captain, hit 200 off 123 balls in a remarkable onslaught against Wellington, including Kerr and her older sister Jess, at Lloyd Elsmore Park.</p>
<p>Central racked up 344 in the 50-over match and Wellington could only manage 168 all out in reply.</p>
<p><span>Wellington's Amelia Kerr usually dominates at age-grade level but was outshone by Central Districts' Jess Watkin in their under-21 tournament match in Auckland.</span></p>
<p><span>Watkin had a huge game, chiming in&nbsp;with 3-35 with the ball in her side's 176-run victory to go three-from-three at the tournament.</span></p>
<p>The 19-year-old from Whanganui had hardly set the cricket world alight with the bat this summer, scoring 10 and 36 in her side's first two matches at the under-21 tournament after innings of 4, 0, 3, 66 (off 36 balls), 1 and 2 for the Central Hinds.</p>
<p>But last season's Central Districts women's player of the year showed her hitting ability at No 3, plundering 20 fours and 11 sixes in her knock. She reached her century off 84 balls and clouted her second ton&nbsp;off&nbsp;just 38, and was out next ball after raising her double-century when&nbsp;caught by Amelia Kerr off the bowling of Xara&nbsp;Jetly in the 45th over.</p>
<p>The Kerr sisters ended with near identical figures with Amelia taking 1-62 and Jess 1-64 off their 10 overs.</p>
<p>Amelia Kerr topscored for Wellington with 63 off 63 balls opening the batting but had little support as Watkin mopped up the tail to complete a day she'll never forget.</p>
