<p class="element element-paragraph">It may take weeks to find out what killed former Steelform Wanganui representative Jake Alabaster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The talented loose forward was found dead on Saturday morning, believed to have passed away in his sleep, age 24.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's understood the results from an autopsy in Auckland will take weeks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Members of a shocked rugby fraternity have speculated Alabaster may have been stung while beekeeping and had a fatal reaction.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He had spent some time overseas to recover from niggling sports injuries and returned recently to take up a beekeeping job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He had been working in Northland last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Stunned members of the community took to Facebook to share their grief and condolences for Alabaster's family.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Posted Bronwyn Poulson: "So young"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Said Craig N Sandi Pye: "Condolences to the Alabaster family. My thoughts are with you all at this very sad time"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A post about his death on the&nbsp;<em>Wanganui Chronicle</em>Facebook page has reached thousands of people and been shared on other Facebook pages, with people expressing their condolences to the Alabaster family.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Beautiful boy - just not fair", one woman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another person posted on the Border Rugby and Sports Club page: "... he portrayed everything good about [a] young man playing rugby".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alabaster debuted for the Wanganui senior team in their 2016 mid-year game against the Manawatu Evergreens in Palmerston North, when several veterans were rested, and scored a try despite going into the match with a sore AC joint.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He played hurt because he knew that's what it was going to take," said Border club coach Ross Williams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alabaster was named in the Wanganui Development XV at the end of the season, but injuries hampered what was otherwise looking like a big career in rugby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The case has been referred to the coroner.</p>
