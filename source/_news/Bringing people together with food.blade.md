<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world</strong></p>
<p>Snowboarding in the morning and cooking for a full restaurant in the evenings is Erin Stone's dream come true.</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student has been the executive chef at Stonesedge restaurant in Whistler, Canada for the last three years.</p>
<p>The 35 year old said it started as a passion and eventually became a career with options.</p>
<p>"In my teens I enjoyed cooking meals for my family and did it regularly. I loved trying out new recipes - and that was how it all started," Ms Stone said.</p>
<p>In Ms Stone's last year of high school she took the subjects she was interested in which included Art Design, Photography, Calculus, Science, English.</p>
<p>The top chef said the most important thing she learnt at school was organisation.</p>
<p>"Being on top of things is so important in my job. I always have my work days and weeks planned out."</p>
<p>Ms Stone said she worked for a few restaurants in New Zealand before going travelling. She ended up working in England and Scotland.</p>
<p>Eventually the aspiring chef moved to Canada with her boyfriend and worked in a restaurant for three years until she became head chef. Four years later she helped open Stonesedge in Ontario and was appointed executive chef.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms Stone said there is nothing better than the satisfaction of creating an amazing meal for someone.</p>
<p>"Food brings people together and I love being able to do that. There's such a rush when you're in the middle of service and pumping out all the food to the full and busy restaurant."</p>
<p>Working the evening shift means Ms Stone is able to enjoy the surreal outdoors during the morning.</p>
<p>"I often snowboard in the morning before having to go into work. We have so many places to go for a hike in the summer, I have two dogs so am always outside. Living in the mountains is so different from home."</p>
<p>Looking into the future Ms Stone said she is now in a position with a lot of options.</p>
<p>"I'm beginning to write a blog and then from there there's a possibility of food tube. I would love to have my own small restaurant or cafe one day. I'm working on concepts for that so I have a plan."</p>
