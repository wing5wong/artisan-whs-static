<p>It was a disappointing Manawatu division 1 secondary school finals day for Whanganui High School as both first XI teams were beaten by Waiopehu College on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The matches were played side-by-side in Palmerston North at 6.45pm, and the WHS Girls team was looking strong leading 2-1 at halftime.</p>
<p>However, Waiopehu struck back quickly after halftime with two scores, and although WHS got a late penalty corner attempt, their goal was disallowed and went down 3-2.</p>
<p>It wasn't as close in the WHS Boys game as despite an enthusiastic effort, Waiopehu College were just stronger on the night in their 5-2 win.</p>
<p>WHS's two Central Under 18 representatives were their goal scorers as Ryan Gray got the first and then Joseph Redpath scored from a stroke.</p>
<p>Both teams will now regroup as they head off for Winter Tournament week - the boys heading to Masterton while the girls travel to Napier.</p>
