<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School's James Rountree exceeded his expectations after a strong finish at the Australian Junior Motocross Championships on Saturday.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The now-16 year old competed over six days in two 15-year divisions of the championships, held in the small Tasmania town of Penguin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountee came 10th in the 250cc 4 stroke class on his Yamaha YZF250, coming just behind the official Australian factory-backed riders and only three points off eighth overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five races counted for each division.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 125cc class, Rountree took his Yamaha to 13th overall, coming five points off another Top 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In the third race on his 125cc he managed a sixth place finish," said father Antony Rountree.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Getting good starts was the key &ndash; riders from fifth to 20th place were only separated by one second a lap.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The finals were held over five 12-minute races on a clay based track. The track got very rutty and fitness and technique played a big part."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Helping Rountree get to Tasmania was his supporters in Bike Torque Taumaranui, Balance Chartered Accountants, Harvey Round Motors, Mitre 10 Future Champions Trust, BNT, Alpine Star and Yamaha NZ.</p>
