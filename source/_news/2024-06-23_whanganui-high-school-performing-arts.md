These lads deserve to 'blow their own trumpet' (or cornet, euphonium or trombone!) as they were selected to compete in the NZ Chamber Music Regional Finals in Wgtn yesterday. Only 36 groups NZ wide, were chosen out of a whopping 400!!! (3 finals took place yesterday in wgtn, chch and ackl. Judges now choose 8 today, to compete in the national final) Congrats (from L to R)  to Toby Clark, Mitchell Cosford, Connor Rooke and Bryn Morgan on your wonderful performance! Special thanks to their tutor Bruce Jellyman for instilling such passion and precision
