<p><br />Samantha White says being a mother is the best thing she has ever done.</p>
<p>She was one of many who celebrated Mothers' Day with a fundraising high tea at Whanganui's Grand Hotel. White has two daughters, <strong>Rosie Rendell, 26, and Daisy, 22</strong>;&nbsp;both former WHS students.</p>
<p>Rosie got in early by sending her mother, a teacher at St John's Hill School, a beautiful bunch of flowers on May 10. White said it was a lovely surprise, and her Year 3 students were very interested in the unexpected arrival.</p>
<p>She was teaching the children to make Mothers' Day cards that day, and suggested they use the word "Mummy", which surprised them.</p>
<p>But she said she loves being called Mummy.</p>
<p>"Whenever my children need anything, that's my name."</p>
<p>Younger daughter Daisy, away at university in Auckland, has also been in touch with her mother on the big day.</p>
<p>"We talk to each other all the time. She sent me some very funny memes and said 'Have a lovely time at the high tea' and 'I love you Mum'."</p>
<p>White was happy with the attention from her daughters, and sat at table in a room full of women, talk and the clink of fine china.</p>
<p>The afternoon tea was a fundraiser for Whanganui's Cancer Society, event co-ordinator Ali Hollard said.</p>
<p>"We thought Mothers' Day would be a great opportunity to raise some much-needed funds."</p>
<p>The society sold more than 80 $25 tickets and will raise at least $2000.</p>

<p><br />The Grand Room venue, and the tea, coffee and bone china were donated by Grand Hotel owner Neville Gorrie.</p>
<p>Cancer Society volunteers and supporters turned out to make the food - cucumber and cream cheese and egg sandwiches, scones with jam and cream, apricot fudge and cinnamon swirls donated by the women of new business Cinnamonui.</p>
<p>Entertainment was provided by <strong>Abigail Livesay,</strong> on piano, and Richard Littlejohn playing guitar, harmonica and singing. There was also a small auction.</p>
