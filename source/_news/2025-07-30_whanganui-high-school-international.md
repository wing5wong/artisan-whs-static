Welcome Namiki High School! ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µðŸŒ¿

We are thrilled to host 14 students from Namiki High School, Tsukuba, Japan, who are visiting our  school until the 4th of August.

Their visit is a wonderful opportunity for cultural exchange, language learning, and building international friendships. From exploring our classrooms to climbing iconic landmarks like Durie Hill Tower ðŸ—¼â€”we're proud to share the beauty of Whanganui with them.
