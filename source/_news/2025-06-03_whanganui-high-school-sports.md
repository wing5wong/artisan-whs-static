Hillary Challenge 6 Hour Adventure Race 2025 

This year, we took a team of 8 up to Rotorua on Sunday the 18th of May to compete in the Hillary Challenge Adventure Racing event. We knew the weekend would be very challenging both physically and mentally, with many activities to keep us thinking and on our toes. However, we could not be sure of what exactly would be thrown our way, which proved to only make things more exciting.

The event started in cold wet conditions involving a Mountain Biking Rogaine through the Redwoods. We had 3 hours to collect as many points as we could. We then dropped our bikes at a remote checkpoint and spent 2 hours running through the forest on foot collecting as many controls as we could â€“ then it was back on the bike to the finish checkpoint then a short 1 hour running leg before the 6 hours had elapsed. 

Overall, the event proved to be great fun and a new experience which none of us will forget. We were extremely proud with our result of being placed 18th out of 21 teams. 

Our team of 8 was: Darcy Johnston, Hadley Wilson, Bailey Barnett, Reegan Payne, Hannah Cameron, Hunter Standen, James McGregor and Lennox Brotherton.  Thanks to Mr Barnett!
