<p><span>FRIEND VERSUS FRIEND: Former WHS student, Lou Tyson [left] was in a cook-off against her friend Jethro Gardiner.</span></p>
<p>Getting beaten by her best friend in a TV cooking show was all fun for former Whanganui woman Lou Tyson.</p>
<p>Brought up in Whanganui she's the big sister of Jessica Tyson, this year's Miss World New Zealand runner-up.</p>
<p>The two both left Whanganui to study at AUT in Auckland, and both do some television work.</p>
<p>Big sister Lou studied business. Her day job is in human resources and accounting but she's a TV presenter in her spare time, with programmes Play, The Adam and Eve Show and 2Kaha.</p>
<p>Last weekend she interviewed sailors on board a navy ship and she talks to an up-and-coming British singer/songwriter next.</p>
<p>"It's very busy, but I love it."</p>
<p>She's not sure why she was chosen as a competitor for the first programme in the new Maori TV series Whanau Bake Off.</p>
<p>The contestants are supposed to be celebrities and she isn't sure she is one - her partner, top Kiwi singer and X Factor judge Stan Walker, is though.</p>
<p>Anyway, she pitted her baking skills against her best friend, Jethro Gardiner, in the Maori TV show that started on Thursday night.</p>
<p>It was her friend who chose key lime pie as the food they both had to cook.</p>
<p>They found a recipe on the internet, and stayed up late to practise making it the night before filming was done.</p>
<p>"The call time was 7am and we were up until 3am. We made about three pies that night, trying it different ways."<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>During filming Miss Tyson made the mistake of copying her friend by adding extra cream cheese - but she forgot to stir it properly. It came out in a lump in the finished pie.</p>
<p>Judge Allyson Gofton said Mr Gardiner's pie was better - but not by much.</p>
<p>Miss Tyson's parents, mum Margaret and dad Raymond love seeing her on television.</p>
<p>"Whenever I'm on, they're my biggest fans. They thought the show was very entertaining, with plenty of laughs."</p>
<p>She recommends the pie, too, as being delicious and easy to make.</p>
