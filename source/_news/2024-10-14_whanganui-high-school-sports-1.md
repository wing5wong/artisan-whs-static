Whanganui High School Junior cricketers represented WHS in a Junior Cricket Festival hosted by Collegiate over the holidays. It was a 3 day tournament – held Thursday, Friday and Saturday at Collegiate with schools from Collegiate, St Peters Cambridge, Scot’s College, Wellington College, Hutt International College and Whanganui High School. All schools are very strong in cricket – and although the boys didn’t win any games, they were very competitive and within a few runs each game.  Most of all, they represented WHS very well. Graham Hall spent the three days umpiring all of our games.  Warren Marr coached the boys, along with parent Aaron Toy, and Mum’s Laura Belliss and Bronwyn Toy were the official scorers.

The boys in the team were:

Jackson Belliss (Year 11) 

Oscar Butcher (Year 11)

Liam Cox (Year 10)

Kyan Hoekstra (Year 10)

James Marshall (Year 10)

Bruce McGregor (Year 9)

Liam Meijer (Year 11)

Leighton Slaughter (Year 10)

Matt Smith (Year 11)

Ethan Toy (Year 10)

Noah Toy (Year 9)
