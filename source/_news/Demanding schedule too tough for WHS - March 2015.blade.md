<p>Wanganui High School had a good start to their netball season, with the wider squad of 12 finishing third at the Super School Invitational tournament at Arena Manawatu on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 14-team field consisted of teams in the top 20 schools at the Lower North Island Secondary School tournament last year, including Wanganui Collegiate.</p>
<p>WHS had a friendly with Sacred Heart College just before the event, winning 24-22, then downed Kapiti College (32-26) and Aotea College (43-27) in pool play.</p>
<p>Coach Lisa Murphy said their last pool match and the semifinals were scheduled for consecutive hours, so they had only a 10-minute turnaround to prepare for Napier Girls High School. The jaded team were beaten 39-25.</p>
<p>WHS then went into the playoff for 3rd/4th and emerged with a 37-28 win over home team Palmerston North Girls High School. Murphy was pleased, considering the team had only one trial game and two training sessions beforehand.</p>
<p>She will have the difficult task of trimming the squad to 10 for the regular season.</p>
<p>Collegiate had key players away due to summer-sport involvement and did not advance out of their pool.</p>
