Last Thursday, we took two chess teams to the Whanganui Chess Regionals Tournament. This was a mixed-level tournament between schools from throughout the region, competing in teams of 4, where the winners would move on to the Nationals tournament later in the year. Our teams each played 4 games, including one against each other. 

**At the end of the day, our A Team (Sam Gray, Connor Rooke, Shawn Lamong, and Zach Paikea) came out on top!  Next stop, Nationals!**
