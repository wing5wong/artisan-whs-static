<p><strong>Central led well by Watkin as Otago crumble.</strong></p>
<p>THE Jessica Watkin-led Central Districts Under-21 team continued their good form at the national tournament in Auckland with a five wicket win over Otago U-21 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Playing at Lloyd Elsmore Park in a rain delayed match, CD restricted Otago to 195-6 from their 46 overs, with Otago relying on a strong turn by wicketkeeper Polly Inglis - who stroked 93 not out from 101 balls after her team were in trouble at 55-5 in the 21st over.</p>
<p>Bowling her spinners, Watkin took 2-29 with two maidens from her nine overs, while Taranaki's Monique Rees got 2-23 from six.</p>
<p>Watkin was disappointed to fail with the bat, being judged LBW for one after just six balls, but her team went on with it to reach 200-5 in 40 overs.</p>
<p>Opener Melissa Hansen (75) and middle order batter Melanie Megaw (55no) were the principal run getters.</p>
<p>Whanganui cricket development officer Dilan Raj said after some personal scores in the 30s for the Central Districts teams, both Under-21 and the Hinds, Watkin really wanted to progress her game across all facets. "She's maturing every single day ... becoming a better cricketer."</p>
<p>Central Districts will take on Northern Districts in their next match today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Watson Wanganui Under-15 just managed to hang on for a draw in their two-day Central Districts game with Manawatu on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Set 230 to win, Whanganui lost wickets with regularity, at one point being 106-7</p>
<p>However, No4 batsman Cameron McIntosh held his nerve and made 64 not out from 124 balls, thwarting the Manawatu bowlers, in particular the dangerous Harry Dean who took 6-65 from 22 overs.</p>
<p>McIntosh managed to just bat through with the tailenders, as Whanganui were on 155-9 when stumps were drawn.</p>
<p>Raj said the young man really stuck in there, showing good hand to eye co-ordination. "Going forward he could be one of the guys to go through for Whanganui."</p>
<p>The draw with a first innings points loss meant the team finished fourth in their Central Districts tournament.</p>
<p>"They're a bit disappointed because they really fancied their chances," said Raj.</p>
<p>The team was apparently hit hard by a stomach bug, with seven of them coming down with the illness.</p>
<p>Raj said he fielded an early morning phone call on Wednesday asking about finding possible replacement players, but as it was too late notice everyone had to gut it out.</p>
<p>It finished a good week for the Whanganui teams as the Under 17s came back from their hammering by Nelson to beat Wairarapa, Manawatu and Hawke's Bay in their CD tournament in Napier.</p>
<p>Whanganui missed the final on run rate, which was rained out after they defeated Hawke's Bay in the playoff for third-fourth.</p>
<p>Raj said batting for the squad was still a concern, however it was noticeable after the Nelson debacle that unlike previous years, the team did not go into their shell and recovered.</p>
<p>Allrounder Connor O'Leary has been chosen for the Central Districts Under 17 team, who will play their national tournament at Lincoln University's Bert Sutcliffe Oval from January 13-21. O'Leary is the first local chosen for this CD team since Brett Cameron was the captain two seasons ago.</p>
