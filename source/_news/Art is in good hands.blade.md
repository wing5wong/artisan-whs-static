<p class="element element-paragraph">In Our Hands, the recent competition showcasing visual art created by youth, attracted some impressive entries.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Young people took part in workshops run by local artists from silk-printing to clay-modelling to further develop their skills before submitting their work for inclusion in the exhibition at Arts @ Centre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The work was judged by Whanganui artist and teacher Maria Fredette who said it was a hard but enjoyable task to select the best work from an impressive range of submissions.</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">The winners were all WHS students: Mahina Barritt painting prize and Aranga Molijn drawing prize in the 12-14 age group, Eloise Young painting prize and Mikayla Baldwin for the top drawing in the 15-18 age group.</h3>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Photography was judged across both age groups with Ilan Ben-Ezra (WHS student) being the winner,</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">and the prize for best description was awarded to Xanthe Cohen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jovanna Penn-Reina was awarded the People's Choice prize for her photograph of the Durie Hill Tower.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event, organised by the Whanganui District Youth Committee, began last year and will be an annual event aimed at the youth of Whanganui with a different theme each year.</p>
