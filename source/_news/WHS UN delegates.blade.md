<p>On Friday 30&nbsp;October our school took 5 delegations of students to the Annual Wanganui Junior Model United Nations event at Girl&rsquo;s College.</p>
<p>The points under discussion were the Refugee Crisis in Europe and what needs to be done; the promotion of tolerance be it gender, race or religion; and finally the world drug problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Year 9 and Year 10 students really got into the spirit of the day, dressing up to represent Japan, Sweden, Egypt, Romania and Fiji.</p>
<p>Students were required to prepare presentations about their country, and then to argue at the &lsquo;UN&rsquo; on behalf of their countries and they did their countries proud. &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">They were extremely well prepared and presented thoughtful and well-reasoned arguments.</span></p>
<p>In addition to dressing up, students also had to decorate their tables and bring food for a shared lunch with the other delegates from other schools representing a myriad of countries. The food was interesting, and the tables colourful.</p>
<p>Our students learnt a great deal about how the UN operates, and got a chance to meet students from other schools.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all five teams on your fine effort. It was wonderful to see our students engaged and thinking about world events, and they were excellent ambassadors for our school.</p>
<p>The following delegations received certificates: <br />Romania &ndash; Best Dressed; <br />Fiji &ndash; Best Table; <br />Sweden &ndash; Merit Award for Best Delegation.</p>
