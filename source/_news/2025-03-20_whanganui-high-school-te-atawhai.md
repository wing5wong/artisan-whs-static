Last Friday, Sport Whanganui held their first All Abilities Athletics Day at Cooks Gardens. The emphasis of the day was on enjoyment, teamwork, and personal achievement while focusing on throwing, jumping and running. 

It was a fun day had by all. A huge thanks to Wendy and the team in our Te Atawhai unit for taking our WHS students. And thanks to our YESS Council students, Isla, Bailey, James and Bruce for helping out for the day. An awesome opportunity for them all,
