Whanganui High School competed at the Manawatu Horowhenua Schools Motocross event.

A team of dedicated riders from Whanganui High School braved the tough conditions at the recent Manawatu Horowhenua Schools Motocross event, held at the Gold Coast Club near Levin. Despite the wet weather and challenging, rutted sand track, our students gave it their all against riders from 34 school teams from across the region.

We're incredibly proud to share that our team, comprised of novice and competitive riders, placed 6th overall in the Secondary Schools event! 

A special shout-out to Leah Bullock, who had a great day on the track, earning a 2nd place podium finish in the 12-19 years Women's class!
