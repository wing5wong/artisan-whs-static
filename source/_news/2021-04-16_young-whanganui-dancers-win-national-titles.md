Four young Whanganui dancers returned from the ‘NZ Medallist of the year 2021’ event held last Sunday in New Plymouth, with all of them winning a New Zealand National Medallist title.

They were assessed by a board of Fellow Examiners to find the most technically proficient candidate in each grade, dance and age group with the highest scored medallist in each being awarded a New Zealand National Medallist title. 

The grades are elementary, bronze, silver and gold and the dances are chosen from the Ballroom, New Vogue and Latin American styles. The candidates had to have achieved a mark of commended or higher in their last medal test to be eligible.

**Reeve Watson**, Taliah Pollero and Patrick Daignault competed in the junior category (13 to 15 year old) while Kereama Allen competed in the Juvenile section (12 and under). Their results were as follows:

**• Reeve competed in Junior Gold and won the Waltz, Tango, Slow Foxtrot and the Quickstep in the Ballroom style and was awarded the Gold Medallist title. She also won the Gold Medallist title for the New Vogue dances of Tracie-Leigh Waltz, Carousel, Tango Terrific and Gypsy Tap. In the Latin American style she won the Rumba.**

• Taliah completed in the Junior Silver, winning the Swing Waltz, Charmaine and Tango in the New Vogue style earning herself the Silver Medallist title. In the Latin American style she won the Rumba, Samba and Jive and was awarded the title for this category as well. 

• Patrick competed in the Junior Silver and was awarded the Silver Medallist title for Ballroom, winning the Waltz, Tango and Quickstep dances.

• Kereama Smith competed in the Juvenile Elementary category, winning the Ballroom dances of Foxtrot and Waltz, winning the New Zealand Juvenile Elementary Medallist title.

The dancers said they all wanted to thank their coach, Mark Glastonbury. “We wouldn’t be here today without him.”
