<p>The weather is holding and Wanganui expat and former WHS student Nick Gillespie is on track to win his second Craigs Investment Partners Pin High Wanganui Pro-Am after coming back to the Belmont Links clubhouse at three under par yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>A field of 39 professionals and teams of amateurs are contesting the 5th edition of the 36-hole tournament, sanctioned by the NZPGA.</p>
<p>Among them was Bay of Plenty's Josh Geary, who when the second play is completed today will be off on the plane back to the PGA tour of China, where he sits atop the Order of Merit and seems destined for a berth on the lucrative PGA circuit of the US.</p>
<p>Apart from a brief cloudburst early in the day, conditions stayed cool but clear and it was Gillespie, the 2013 winner, who shot an opening round 67.</p>
<p>Gillespie, who won the title after a play-off with Grant Moorehead in 2013, will be wary of staying on-course today, with Waikato's Brad Shilton only a shot back after an opening round 68, followed by Canterbury's Steven Heyes on 69.</p>
<p>Auckland's Richard Lee and Wanganui's Simon Owen are in a tie for fourth after an even round of 70.</p>
<p>The tournament continues today and is expected to conclude around 2pm.</p>
