<p>MEASURED MOTION: Former WHS student Eva Harkness with her tape measure.<br />PHOTO / Stuart Munro.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The works on show at Edith Gallery in Taupo Quay are the result of 10 weeks' work by UCOL art and design students.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lecturers Kathryn Wightman and Leigh Anderton-Hall gave their students a brief to design and construct their own "drawing machines".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The drawings created by the machines have been used as points of origin to form paintings, sculptures, videos, photographs, posters, etc.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Eva Harkness used a metal tape measure to create her machine and Kristine Lott fashioned hers from a wind-up triceratops with a paint brush attached.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dr Wightman said the first-year bachelor students had all shown great design abilities and independently explored a wide range of ideas and techniques.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each student was required to experiment with three machine ideas and part of the brief was to give a five-minute presentation on their successes and failures.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Machines That Make Marks is on show at the Edith Gallery, 24 Taupo Quay, 10am-3pm week days.</strong></p>
