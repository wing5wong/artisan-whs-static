<p class="element element-paragraph">St Johns Club Whanganui Metro managed to maintain structure as it dealt Kia Toa a 59-0 hiding on Saturday on its way to the Manawatu McDonald's Colts division final in Palmerston North this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The win was fully expected with Kia Toa winless in round two of the competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Fact, Kia Toa waved the white flag after just 60 minutes of play and after discussion with both sides referee Ben Lourie called the match off to allow the visitors to escape an even more embarrassing loss.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The challenge for co-coaches Carl Gibson and Darryl Malcolm was to maintain structure and practice set pieces and combinations ahead of this weekend's final against Massey White.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Massey White have won the Gordon Brown Memorial Cup for the past three years on end going through pool play unbeaten until this season. Feilding and Metro are the only two teams to lower the Massey White colours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Saturday and the Kaierau Country Club the Metro lads ran in nine tries and converted seven. Kia Toa simply had no answer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have struggled at times to field teams and a full bench this season, but we are almost back to full strength and everyone got a run on Saturday," Gibson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We weren't able to train much during the week because of the weather, but just before the Kia Toa game on the day we practiced a few set pieces and combinations. We managed to maintain structure throughout the match and run those moves and some others we hope to bring out in the final against Massey White.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great to see the boys maintain structure because things can get a bit silly when you are winning by big scores.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our games against Massey have all been close and could have just as easily gone our way just like it did a couple of weeks back when we finally did. We know we can beat them and are heading into the final confident."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">More rain is expected in the North Island this week with the heaviest forecast for Thursday, so the prospects of a dry track at Arena Manawatu is almost non-existent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Arena is usually a good track wet or dry and we will just adapt to the conditions - it won't worry us too much."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Blindside flanker and Metro captain George Forster again had a solid game marshalling his troops while also scoring a try. Winger Cajun Botica scored two tries, with others dotted down by Lochie Steedman, Laurence Weber, Brayden Maua, Karihi Potaka-Osborne Whanarere and Tyrone Houltham, while fullback James Dorgan did the kicking.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Apart from three players out for the season we are injury-free and expect to field pretty much a full strength side and bench in te final."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Go-to hooker Sean Morahan is out with a disc problem in his back, starting centre Mike Wakeling is sidelined with rib cartilage damage and regular first five and team kicker Stefan Hannan has left to join the New Zealand Army.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, as proven on Saturday, Metro has the depth to cover these positions.</p>
