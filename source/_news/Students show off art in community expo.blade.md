<p><strong>STRONG MESSAGE: Whanganui High School arts teacher Glen Hutchins with students Shayal Sen (17), Airini Ross-Spooner (16) and Ilan Ben-Ezra (17) mimic Ilan's painting representing "see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil".</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students are putting whaling on the front line with a collaborative art exhibition on display at the Community Art Centre in Whanganui until June 3.</strong></p>
<p>For the second year running, Whanganui High School and Rangitikei College have worked together on an exhibition project with the same brief - and this year the theme is whaling.</p>
<p>Students have independently researched and responded to the concept by creating a large painting which will be assessed and exhibited in a public gallery.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Whanganui High student Ilan Ben-Ezra said they had been planning the project since the start of term one and he was excited to see his work exhibited for the second year running.</p>
<p>"My piece was about how people would avoid whaling as an issue. The three figures are See No Evil, Hear No Evil and Speak No Evil."</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Airini Ross-Spooner's painting told a different story.</p>
<p>"My print is more about a whale protecting our country and our people and guiding our ancestors through their journey," she said.</p>
<p>Shayal Sen created a painting called&nbsp;<em>Whales of the Galaxy</em>.</p>
<p>"Us humans hurt whales on the earth, so I put them in the galaxy, where no one can hurt them," Shayal said.</p>
<p>There are 50 works on display, and each piece will be assessed to gain credits towards NCEA qualifications.</p>
<p><strong><a class="imgWrap" href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/video/news/video.cfm?c_id=1503418&amp;gal_cid=1503418&amp;gallery_id=176157"><span class="vidOver">Video</span></a></strong></p>
<p>High school arts teacher Glen Hutchins said all the teachers were proud of the students&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the art was a great representation of New Zealand whaling history and the contemporary issues that remain.</p>
<p>"It is great to see print-making and painting so alive within our youth."</p>
<p>Arts teacher of Rangitikei College, Vanessa Edwards, said the project created an authentic space for students to see their work beyond an NCEA assessment grade.</p>
<p>"We are teaching to an unknown future and need to build confidence and resilience in our young people to put themselves out there to celebrate their successes and reflect on their failures," Ms Edwards said.</p>
<p><strong>An opening night will take place on Friday, May 19, from 5pm and all are welcome.</strong></p>
