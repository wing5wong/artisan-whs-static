All the very best to Ex WHS Students Maggie Jones and Flynn Johnston as they start a new chapter in their Athletics sporting careers heading to the United States on Scholarships next week.

We wish you both the best and know you will go well and make ever lasting memories.

We caught up with Maggie and Flynn last week to discuss it all.

What university are you going to?

Jacksonville State University, Alabama. (It’s a Div 1 College that is part of the C-USA athletics conference).

What is your scholarship and what degree are you doing?

I will be studying towards a Bachelor of Science with a Biology focus. The course I have chosen is described as a Pre Health degree and after 4 years I hope to continue on to graduate school to continue to study Health. (I’m not sure what area yet). My scholarship is a mix of Athletic and Academic Aid. These scholarships combined cover most of my academic costs. It’s also a massive perk that being part of the track team means that all my costs involved with training, treatment/recovery, travel, clothing, spikes/footwear are all covered by the schools athletics department.

What do you hope to achieve while you are over there?

Along with gaining my science degree I definitely hope to better my track times. There is a huge pool of talented athletes in America so race experience competing at the collegiate (college) level will be invaluable. You just don’t get the depth of athletic competition here in NZ.

What are you most looking forward to?

I’m really looking forward to the overall experience of being a Student Athlete in the States. Living in a dorm, meeting new people, and really just enjoying the whole experience.

What message would you give aspiring young athletes at WHS?

Good things take time so just trust the process and put in the work both in the classroom and on the sports field. And to enjoy the good days but learn from the bad. There are always lessons to be learnt. I am grateful for the opportunities that Whanganui High School offered to me over the last 5 years. The amazing Whanganui High School staff have been extremely supportive in helping me meet the academic requirements needed as part of the scholarship process. Sports were also a huge part of my time at school and I’ve had so many amazing coaches and opportunities at Whanganui High School. A special mention to Greg Fromont for his guidance over the past 6 years.

What university are you going to? Black Hills State University, South Dakota.

What is your scholarship and what degree are you doing?

Bachelor of Kinesiology on an athletic and academic scholarship.

What do you hope to achieve while you are over there?

Graduate with a bachelor's, make many new friends, explore as much of America as I can as well as see how far I can go with my hurdling and creating some unforgettable memories.

What are you most looking forward to?

A whole new culture.

What message would you give aspiring young athletes at Whanganui High School?

Give everything a go. Take any and every opportunity you can and give it your best shot. Don't be left wondering. A huge thanks to our Sports Performance Coach Greg Fromont for the guidance he has given myself and Maggie over the years at Whanganui High School.
