<p>TEAM MAN: &nbsp;Former WHS Kayaker Aiden Nossiter accepts the Junior Team award on behalf of himself and team mate Max Brown at the 2015 Ray White Wanganui Sports Awards held at the Wanganui Racecourse on Friday 20 November.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While kayaker Max Brown couldn't be there, his team-mate Aiden Nossiter once again ascended the stage to accept the Treadwell Gordon Junior Team award on their behalf.</p>
<p>Nossiter thanked the Wanganui Multisport and Triathlon Club and loyal coach Brian Scott for "all the behind the scenes stuff" that helped them finish eighth in the world for Under 23s K2 in Portugal. "He's been a good K2 partner over the 6-7 years I've been kayaking now," said Nossiter about his absent mate.</p>
