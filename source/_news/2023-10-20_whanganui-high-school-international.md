Natasha McKee, our Director of International Students, was delighted to meet scholarship recipient Vu Thi Bang Trang and her parents yesterday at the Education New Zealand Ha Noi Fair. We look forward to welcoming her to Whanganui High School in July next year.

We were thrilled to learn a student who has chosen to study at [Whanganui High School - International](https://www.facebook.com/WhanganuiHighInternational?__cft__[0]=AZXEzW7VcV-jjJTQ-qp7I0UlIbymIYvXPku7fUJZvKIDOo_bKSYCKPhCrA4-tKn4X0TieQRyCDicyP_RI2Cf-RY5RZVlA2LsVfSrjRUNhV5rQ8cvMmBFxEZH05jxxbJolRCFoynnHRQOrOAO7SAXsz2SAKwarANMgZ08xZdoNuJAIYRg120Z6t6vkCKCv1Digl6blJfB0ZTmV41J5JcSSF7P&__tn__=-]K-y-R) has been selected by Education New Zealand as a scholarship [](<>)recipient. Vu Thi Bang Trang (14) will start her study with Whanganui High School in July 2024, once she finishes her exams. Scholarships are awarded based on studentâ€™s outstanding academic achievements and the recipients often extend their study beyond the one-year scholarship period.
