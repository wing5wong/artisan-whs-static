<p>All the best to Coach Greg Fromont, Manager Elaine Baker and our 17 WHS Students in Dunedin this weekend at the NZSS Track &amp; Field Champs!!! Go Hard team!!</p>
<p>Whanganui High schools&rsquo; biggest athletics team to attend the NZ Secondary Champs in many years left today to take on the best talent in NZ over the weekend in Dunedin.</p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>This year we have managed to qualify a team of 17 athletes which consists of 7 seniors and 10 juniors many of whom have been part of high school&rsquo;s development pathway for the last 2 years.</p>
<p>There are 6 relay teams, the Junior girls, Junior boys and Senior boys 4 x 100mtrs and Junior girls, Junior boys and Senior boys 4 x 400mtrs all of whom have a great opportunity of finishing in the top 8 nationally.</p>
<p>In addition to this we have the current national and North Island 1500mtr champ and a number of other athletes ranked in the top 10 in the country in their respective events.</p>
<p>A particular strength this year has been in hurdles where we have 8 athletes competing across 12 events, all of whom have good chances of at least making semis or finals.<br />In total the team will contest 45 events, including sprints, running, jumping, throwing and pole vault.</p>
<p>With an average age of only 15, and the quality of performances by the team going up every year it&rsquo;s a great time to be an athlete at WHS.</p>
