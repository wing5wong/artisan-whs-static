<p><span>TACKLED: WHS second-five Mitchell Millar is brought down in a textbook tackle by a Bush player on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XV are poised for a semifinal spot in the Manawatu Colts competition after dispatching Bush 29-12 in their first home game of the season on Saturday.</p>
<p>Initially, WHS were to host Dannervirke last weekend, but the match was abandoned due to the floods.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">However, WHS deputy principal Chris Friedel said the boys lifted for the occasion on Saturday to send Bush packing and secure third spot on the table with three games to play before the semifinals.</span></p>
<p>"It was a nice win on Saturday and leaves us clearly in third, but it is an interesting competition. There are a lot of big boys and they bring a physical game. We have Massey Ag, Freyburg and Te Kawau to play at home in the coming weeks and they are at the bottom of the table."</p>
