<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Harrier Club hosted their last event for 2017 with the Gavin Collins Half Marathon on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In warm weather conditions, the course started at the Whanganui Multisport clubrooms on Anzac Parade and ran through Kowhai Park, heading over the Dublin Street Bridge and down to the Wanganui Sailing Club on Gilberd St, before heading back on the same route.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Gavin Collins Memorial Cup was claimed by Liam Jones in his sixth half marathon, finishing in a time of 1h 30m 50s.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Spokeswoman Mandy Jones said while this was not a personal best time, it was a good effort for Liam after a period of sickness and then injury.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a great ending to what has been a great season for him.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He won the senior boys 1500m and 3000m at Inter Schools in March and he also claimed the Whanganui senior boys cross country title back in May."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>As Jones is finishing up at Whanganui High School and has university on the horizon, the win may have been his last run with the harrier club after eight years as a member.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On the day, Jones had to compete with Thomas Conder - as they ran together for the first 8km before Jones forged ahead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The younger brother of New Zealand representative Christian Conder, it was Thomas' first half marathon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He has also been a consistent regular member of the club for a decent amount of time as well. Liam and Thomas have forged a great friendship over this this time frame as well," said Mandy Jones.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ashley Christie eventually came through to get second place with Conder finishing a very creditable third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">First woman home was Eleanor Arnst, with runnersup Nicky Scott and Kim Whyte more than ten minutes behind her.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The overall walking race was won by Damien Wood, with a good effort by Robin Howard for second and Colin Ward coming in third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kate Quigley raced well to be first woman's walker, with visitors Heather Yalden and Lynette Brown second and third respectively, before Paula Goudie was the next Wanganui Harrier in fourth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was also some excellent runs Brittney Matthews, Ben Conder, Jessica Johnstone, Lindsay Johnstone, Alice Quigley and Amelia Richmond in their respective age groups.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although this completes the official Harrier club calender, the members will still compete and assist with the annual Pak'n Save 3 Bridges Marathon on December 9.</p>
