<p>DOWNHILL RACER: Cameron Russell (WHS) gets some air on a fast downhill section of the exciting new mountain bike course at Araheke in Whanganui.</p>
<p>The second annual Whanganui regional Inter-School Mountain Bike Championships took place at Pauri Lake on Friday, June 24, and attracted schoolchildren from Whanganui and its surrounding regions, and even a few from Palmerston North.</p>
<p><strong>WHS results:&nbsp;MTB Senior Boys (Yr11-13)</strong><br /><strong>Lochie Steedman -&nbsp;1st&nbsp;</strong><br />Finn Caseley -&nbsp;<span>8th</span><br />Hamish Beissel -&nbsp;<span>10th</span><br />Ben Mottram -&nbsp;<span>11th</span></p>
<p>Wanganui Mountain Bike Club and Sport Whanganui teamed up to run the event, which is aimed at getting Year 6-13 schoolchildren on bikes and giving them the chance to represent their schools in a competitive yet non-threatening environment.</p>
<p>Cherie Prince, Sport Whanganui's regional bike development officer, who this year co-ordinated the event, says the Championships might be viewed as a stepping stone leading to potential future opportunities.</p>
<p>"These Champs might be the first chance some children have had to take part and compete in a regional mountain biking event, and so it's about helping give young people more confidence both in terms of their mountain biking skills, and also potentially to go on and compete at higher levels," Cherie says.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time, the Championships were open to Year 6 schoolchildren (as well as Year 7-13), meaning the event grew from last year - and organisers hope the event will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Nigel McIlroy, committee member of Wanganui Mountain Bike Club and sports co-ordinator at Whanganui Intermediate School (one of the participating schools) says the Championships are a great way to get kids into mountain biking.</p>
<p>"This year's Champs were a pleasure to do - very enjoyable. Opening up the event to Year 6 students proved successful as it was very well supported. Well done to all the young people who took part," Nigel says.</p>
<p>"I was inspired and motivated by participants' ability and strength," Whanganui's Glenn Haden, elite road and mountain bike rider, said. He helped out as a lead rider, riding ahead of the fastest rider to ensure participants kept to the planned route. &brvbar; To learn more about the Championships, or find out more about biking, contact Cherie Prince on (06) 349 2882 or email cherie@sportwhanganui.co.nz</p>
