<p><strong>HANDS UP: The Whanganui kayakers, the majority made up of past and present WHS students, at Lake Karapiro celebrate their successes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE NZCT canoe sprint national championships&nbsp;at&nbsp;Lake Karapiro&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;start of&nbsp;the&nbsp;month saw 20 of Whanganui's sprint kayaking fraternity fronting up to&nbsp;the&nbsp;best in&nbsp;the&nbsp;country.</strong></p>
<p>Coach Brian Scott said across&nbsp;the&nbsp;board all&nbsp;the&nbsp;members competed well and&nbsp;the&nbsp;club showed it continued to hold its own among&nbsp;the&nbsp;top five clubs in New Zealand while staying ahead of&nbsp;thedeveloping clubs.</p>
<p>Reports have already been made&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;four Under 23 stars <strong>Aiden Nossiter, Max Brown, Toby Brooke and Erica Tanner</strong>, who will go&nbsp;on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;NZ age group trials.</p>
<p>Yet Scott said it is&nbsp;the&nbsp;club's other youngsters and its masters who have shown&nbsp;the&nbsp;kayaking club, which is a branch of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Whanganui Multisport and Triathlon Club, has maintained its depth despite being "badly knocked around" by&nbsp;the&nbsp;June 2015 floods.</p>
<p>At each end of&nbsp;the&nbsp;spectrum, Robyn Scott (masters) and Anna Clifton (U13) performed well - Scott winning&nbsp;the&nbsp;K1 500m gold and then teaming with Amie Simpson to take&nbsp;the&nbsp;K2 500m silver, followed by another gold in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K4 500m.</p>
<p>Clifton make two K1 A finals with a best result of sixth in&nbsp;the&nbsp;1200m, before teaming up with <strong>Sophie Brooke, Katie Foster and Jess Thompson</strong> to win bronze in both&nbsp;the&nbsp;Under 14 K4 200m and 500m.</p>
<p><strong>Brooke and Foster</strong> won silver in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Under 14 K2 200m and 500m, with <strong>Thompson and Clifton</strong> finishing fifth.</p>
<p>"As an individual,<strong> Sophie Brooke</strong> shone and was&nbsp;the&nbsp;only individual paddler to really challenge&nbsp;the&nbsp;Arawa [Christchurch] and Poverty Bay stranglehold&nbsp;on&nbsp;this division," said Scott.</p>
<p><strong>Brooke</strong> won bronze in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K1 500m.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;Under 16 division,&nbsp;the&nbsp;relatively inexperienced pairing of<strong> Nanea Schurhammer and Louise Clifton</strong> were surprising competitive in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K2 200m, placing eighth in&nbsp;the&nbsp;A final.</p>
<p><strong>Schurhammer and Clifton</strong> also exceeded expectations when they went up a grade to join leader <strong>Sapere Simon and Abby Hurley</strong> in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K4 200m for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Under 18s.</p>
<p>"Against highly favoured boats&nbsp;the&nbsp;girls kept their technique going, eventually paddling themselves into&nbsp;the&nbsp;bronze medal spot," said Scott.</p>
<p>"In&nbsp;the&nbsp;K4 500m they almost caused another upset when they were lying in a clear third spot only 150m from&nbsp;the&nbsp;end."</p>
<p>The pair eventually faded to finish in fourth place, understandable given&nbsp;the&nbsp;two younger girls had just come from K1 500m semifinals.</p>
<p>The majority of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Whanganui competitors in&nbsp;the&nbsp;boys' Under 16 grade were in their first year of&nbsp;the&nbsp;division.</p>
<p><strong>Lucas Thompson and Jack Clifton</strong> cemented themselves as&nbsp;the&nbsp;crew to watch next year after a bronze medal in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K2 200m and fourth in&nbsp;the&nbsp;500m.</p>
<p>"All other crews were a year older and will be moving into&nbsp;the&nbsp;U18 division in 2017," said Scott.</p>
<p><strong>Thompson and Clifton</strong> were also&nbsp;the&nbsp;mainstays of&nbsp;the&nbsp;K4 boats, teaming with <strong>Cameron Russell and Jack Brown</strong> for fourth in&nbsp;the&nbsp;200m, followed by <strong>Thompson, Clifton, Russell and Liam Lace</strong> winning silver in&nbsp;the&nbsp;500m.</p>
<p><strong>Lace and Thompson</strong> also qualified for A Finals in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K1 200m and 500m respectively.</p>
<p>The Under 18 division was tough for first-timers <strong>Campbell Tanner and Ethan Ross</strong>, who were adjusting to&nbsp;the&nbsp;difference in strength and power.</p>
<p>Both made semifinals in K1, and had to settle for eighth in&nbsp;the&nbsp;K2 200m A final.</p>
<p>It was a similar story in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Under 18 girls' grade for individuals, where<strong> Hurley</strong> paddled well but was unable to make an A final.</p>
<p>After a good season of training <strong>Simon</strong> acquitted herself well and made&nbsp;the&nbsp;A final of&nbsp;the&nbsp;K1 500m.</p>
<p>"To do so she had to knock out&nbsp;the&nbsp;stroke seat paddler of&nbsp;the&nbsp;NZ U18 women's K4 crew in her heat," said Scott.</p>
<p><strong>Simon</strong> ultimately earned a trial for&nbsp;the&nbsp;NZ Under 18 squad after coming seventh in&nbsp;the&nbsp;A Final, coming after 18 months of training.</p>
<p>She then went up a couple of levels to team with Under 23 <strong>Erica Tanner</strong> and race in&nbsp;the&nbsp;open women's K2 against&nbsp;the&nbsp;Olympics-bound NZ team members, including gold medallist Lisa Carrington.</p>
<p>Although outclassed as had been expected,&nbsp;the&nbsp;pair raced well against&nbsp;the&nbsp;other Under 23 crews in&nbsp;the&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;Open K4,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Whanganui team were silver medallists in both 200m and 1000m.</p>
<p>"After absorbing all&nbsp;the&nbsp;age group and open racing, two of&nbsp;the&nbsp;best results came in events that are still considered new to&nbsp;the&nbsp;sport," said Scott.</p>
<p>"These were&nbsp;the&nbsp;age group 6x100m relays and&nbsp;the&nbsp;mixed K4.</p>
<p>"In both events&nbsp;the&nbsp;Whanganui teams performed amazingly well with a second and third in&nbsp;the&nbsp;mixed K4s and then a second in&nbsp;the&nbsp;relay."</p>
<p>The only teams to beat them were&nbsp;the&nbsp;Arawa club, who would take overall club points honours for&nbsp;the&nbsp;weekend.</p>
