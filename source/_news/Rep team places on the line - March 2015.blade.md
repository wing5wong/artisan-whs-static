<p>NO 1 SEED: &nbsp;Sam Russell, 15, at the start of the junior championships yesterday afternoon at the Wanganui Tennis Club.</p>
<p>Seats on the van to Wellington are on the line at the Wanganui Tennis Club this afternoon as the junior championships conclude.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday after school, the secondary schools competition got under way with seven girls in one draw and 25 boys in the other - competing in a 32-player level competition with a couple of byes.</p>
<p>This morning the primary and intermediate competitions will be held, with three girls and six boys taking part, before the remainder of the secondary draw is played out in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Wanganui Christie Cup player Sam Russell from Wanganui High School was the No1 seed in the boys secondary grade, while others like Jaiden Edmonds are strong contenders.</p>
<p>Development officer Gene Ridgway said the biggest contingent came from Wanganui Collegiate, joining a handful from Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>The weekend was also supposed to include doubles and mixed doubles competitions, however Ridgway said no players had listed their preferred partners to put together a draw.</p>
<p>Therefore, the doubles component of the junior championships will be held another weekend.</p>
<p>The singles championships will form the selection criteria for the Wanganui players to attend Tennis Central teams event next weekend.</p>
<p>A boy and girl will be chosen for the Under-10, 12, 14 and 16 grades to play mixed doubles and singles against teams from Hutt Valley, Wellington, Horowhenua, Kapiti Mana, Manawatu, Taranaki, Wairarapa and a mixed team.</p>
