<p><br />Tawhero School applied to the Freemason&rsquo;s Charity Trust for assistance to take the whole school on a day trip to the Army Museum at Waiouru. The school has around 140 students.</p>
<p>This funding requires a Masonic Lodge sponsor and the United Lodge of Wanganui No 468 joined in with a donation of their own from their Benevolent Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Darol Pointon </strong>(former WHS staff member), the Lodge&rsquo;s Treasurer and Trustee, was appointed by them t<span class="text_exposed_show">o arrange with the school and make the presentation, which took place at a school assembly on Monday, May 27. Darol advises that &ldquo;the lodge&rsquo;s portion will be part of the dispersement of funds to be made at their October meeting.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The funding will cover the buses and Museum entry costs allowing the school to focus on the learning outcomes and not having to raise the money.</span></p>
