<p class="element element-paragraph">The More FM Polar Plunge attracted a big crowd of masochists and an even larger crowd of voyeurs eager to see the self-inflicted torture.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The rain held off long enough for everyone to get wet from the feet upwards before retiring to the Castlecliff Club for prize giving, hot soup and sausages.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Paul Brooks joined the onlookers with his camera.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyler McDonald from More FM presented the following prizes at the Castlecliff Club after the swim.</p>
