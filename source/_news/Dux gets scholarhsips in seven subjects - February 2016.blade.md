<p>PREMIER SCHOLAR: Amaan Merchant, pictured with parents Samina and Mohib Merchant, is the highest achiever of several at Wanganui High School.</p>
<p><strong>Wanganui High school students made an impressive showing&nbsp;in&nbsp;scholarship awards for 2015 with students picking up 30 awards but the most impressive achievement went to last year's school dux Amaan Merchant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amaan was one of just eight New Zealand students to receive a premier award for outstanding&nbsp;scholarships&nbsp;in&nbsp;chemistry, economics, physics and statistics as well as&nbsp;scholarships&nbsp;in&nbsp;calculus, earth and space science and music.</strong></p>
<p>High school principal Garry Olver said he is extremely proud of all the students and their teachers for their levels of achievement.</p>
<p>"For a decile 4 school&nbsp;in&nbsp;a regional city, Wanganui High school is showing that academic achievement is attainable&nbsp;in&nbsp;the provinces," Mr Olver said.</p>
<p>Amaan also gives a lot of credit to his teachers, especially his maths teachers, for their encouragement and setting the bar for him.</p>
<p>"They really encouraged me to push myself and there was opportunity to complete levels ahead of time so you could concentrate on other things," he said.</p>
<p>Along with fellow students Julian Schurhammer and Elia Nicolin, Amaan won New Zealand's Next Top Engineering Scientist competition run by Auckland University last year and he has competed&nbsp;inregional judo and debating competitions.</p>
<p>Amaan also found time to dabble&nbsp;in&nbsp;local politics as a member of the Whanganui District Council youth committee and was guitarist with Smokefree Rockquest winners Contraband for the past two years.</p>
<p>He will be studying towards a bachelor of commerce and bachelor of science concurrently and says he will be staying&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Auckland university halls of residence for the first year.</p>
<p>"Most Whanganui students are going to Victoria or Massey to study, but two of my friends will be studying&nbsp;in&nbsp;Auckland," he said.</p>
<p>The Merchant family moved to Whanganui&nbsp;in&nbsp;2008, coming from the United States, and dad Dr Mohib Merchant and mum Samina say they are very proud of their only son, although they will miss him.</p>
<p>There may have been even more scholarship awards for WHS students last year if head students Pratibha Singh and Rhaz Solomon had been&nbsp;in&nbsp;the running.</p>
<p>Mr Olver said Pratibha was selected to go and study on an exchange programme&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Netherlands and Rhaz became ill while attending space camp&nbsp;in&nbsp;the US and took a long time to recover.</p>
<p>Rhaz was one of five New Zealand students selected to attend the astronaut training&nbsp;in&nbsp;Alabama but he was unable to complete it due to illness and took a while to recover when he returned to New Zealand.</p>
