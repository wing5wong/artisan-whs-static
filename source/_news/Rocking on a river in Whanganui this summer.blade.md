<p class="element element-paragraph">Whiskey Mama is a band of five trusty rock veterans well known to Whanganui audiences and they love to foster young talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Guitarist Fred Loveridge says the Rock on the River concert at Caroline's Boatshed on January 6 will give some young Whanganui bands the opportunity to share their music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whiskey Mama will provide the mobile stage and headline the concert hosted by Caroline Norton of Caroline's Boatshed on Somme Pde.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"There is some great young talent in Whanganui and we want to give a couple of high school bands the chance to play with roadworthy performers like ourselves,"</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Ferris</em> and <em>In Business</em> formed at Whanganui High School and competed in Rockquest this year.<br /><br /></strong></p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br /><strong>"They have some great original songs and I think a Whanganui audience will enjoy hearing them play live," says Loveridge.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Norton says she is very happy to host the event at her venue.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have worked with Kerry and Fred often and the suggestion came up in conversation and I love the idea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These young bands are our musicians of tomorrow and I think it will be a wonderful concert."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rock on the River will open at 2pm on Sunday, January 6. The concert is free and Caroline's Boatshed Bar &amp; Eatery will be open for meals and bar service.</p>
