<p><strong>The Whanganui High School students who are off to tournament week.</strong></p>
<p>It is that time of year again as hundreds of student athletes from Whanganui will head out all over the North Island for Winter Tournament Week.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School has 181 students across 11 teams and six different codes who will be competing elsewhere.</p>
<p>They have worked hard all season, both in training and competing in their local competitions.</p>
<p>WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said it had been a strong winter with Phillips Electrical A1 Netball, the rugby 1st XV, 1st XI girls' football, both the boys' and girls' 1st XI hockey and two senior boys' basketball teams making finals.</p>
<p>"WHS also have some talented juniors coming through and competing in our senior teams, which is promising for the future."</p>
<p>The school will keep their community of staff, families, and students updated on the WHS School Sports Facebook page.</p>
<p>The boys' and girls' hockey teams are heading to Masterton and Napier respectively, while the girls' football squad is in Napier and the boys go to Taupo.</p>
<p>The 1st XV rugby squad are off to Hastings while the under-15s go to Wellington. The junior boys' and girls' basketball teams will play in New Plymouth.</p>
<p>The senior boys basketballers go to Palmerston North and the badminton squad head to Hamilton.</p>
<p>The netball tournament is at home this year, at Laird Park.</p>
<p>Wanganui Collegiate is also sending teams to various sporting challenges - including some in the South Island and new destinations for 2016.</p>
<p>The boys' hockey 1st XI travel to Dunedin, with the girls' team heading to Ashburton.<br />New locations see the under-15 boys' hockey going to St Paul's, while the Senior A boys basketballers are in Tauranga.</p>
<p>The under-15 rugby team heads to Lindisfarne.</p>
<p>Playing at home will be the under-15 girls' hockey team, the boys' football 1st XI and the Senior A netball side.</p>
