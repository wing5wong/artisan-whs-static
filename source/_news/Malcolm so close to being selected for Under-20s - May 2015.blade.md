<p><span>CLOSE SHAVE: Former WHS student 19-year-old Sam Malcolm may have just missed the cut for the NZ Under-20 World Championship squad, but was proud to have worn and played in the black jersey.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui teenager Sam Malcolm has gone within a whisker of making the New Zealand squad for the Under-20 World Rugby Championships in Italy, starting next week.</p>
<p>The former Wanganui High School star back trialled for a spot in the squad in Tauranga on Monday and, while he played well, the decision came down to injury recovery in the Hurricanes Super Rugby team.</p>
<p>Confirmation that Hurricanes first five-eighth Beauden Barrett would be back from his knee injury has freed up stand-in No10 Otere Black to join the Under-20 team for the world championships on June 2-20.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was the same position Malcolm was trialling for, even though he is also an accomplished halfback.</p>
<p>"I was disappointed, but so thrilled at the same time to have worn and played in an All Black jersey," Malcolm said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It's been a childhood dream to play in the black jersey. I was happy enough with my trial game, even though I only had two days to prepare with the squad and learn all the moves."</p>
<p>However, the door to the world championships has not been completely closed to the 19-year-old second year Massey University student. "I am on standby in case there are injuries. If Otere is injured, I may still be flown to Italy."</p>
<p>Malcolm will continue to play for his university in the Manawatu competition.</p>
<p>"The goal is to become a professional rugby player and, if I continue to chip away at it, hopefully doors will open."</p>
