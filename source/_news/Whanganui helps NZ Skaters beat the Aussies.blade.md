<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>WHS students Renee Teers (left) and Monique Cleeve (former student) do well at the Oceania Speed Skating Championships in Timaru.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui speed skaters who represented New Zealand at the 2018 Oceania Speed Skating Championships in Timaru over Easter all performed with distinction as the home team regained the Trans-Tasman title from Australia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chase Morpeth and Drew Brennan in the Cadet Boys (Under 15) were most impressive.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The two youngsters were the smallest and youngest competitors in their age group but both came away with a clutch of medals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brennan took a bronze medals in the 5km points race, the 500m and the marathon in an impressive display.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Morpeth earned silver in the 300TT and both Whanganui teenagers were in the gold medal-winning relay team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>In the highly competitive Junior Girls (Under 19) grade, Renee Teers brought home a bronze in the 5km elimination race and the 500m sprint.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>She was a member of the New Zealand No1 Relay team, which took the gold from Australia.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Monique Cleeve threatened the podium all competition, making the 500m final but getting piped at the line by Teers.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Cleeve finally got a well deserved bronze in the 42km marathon behind the Timaru pair of Arianna Snook and Leah McDonald, with Teers fourth for a Kiwi sweep.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Cleeve also picked up a bronze as a member of the New Zealand No2 relay team.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McDonald was the overall Junior Women's Champion after a tough battle with Australia's Giselle Stogdale.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Andrew Jones was up against some class opposition in the Senior Men's class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He picked up a good bronze in the 15km Elimination behind Australians Jaiden Lannigan and Mitchell Ross, being the lone New Zealander left at the finish, although he couldn't overcome the Australian pair's teamwork.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jones got a string of fourth placings in other events but would have been disappointed not to have reached the podium more often, based on his recent form.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's <strong>Rebecca Smith</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) coached the Cadet Girls grade to a win over their Australian rivals.</p>
