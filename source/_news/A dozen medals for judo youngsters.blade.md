<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>It was a 12 medal haul for the six Whanganui judokas who attended the Waikato/Bay of Plenty championships in Rotorua over the long weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The two days of competition once again proved profitable for the Watson family, as oldest brother Keightley, 16, fought in the cadet division, winning both his weight group and the Open weight.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Keightley then stepped up to the Junior Men's competition and again claimed double gold.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Sister Brierley Watson, 14, returned to the mat for the first time in two years, fighting up a grade in the cadet women's division (15-18), where she won the open weight bronze.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>On Day 2, Brierley went back to her normal age and weight group in senior girls, winning the gold in her weight category and Open weight, despite a brief time in training after her 11th hour decision to get back into the sport.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Younger brother Callaghan Watson, 11, was up against 14-year-olds who had their age and height advantage over him, but still made the podium, winning silver in the senior boys 66kg grade.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Watson sibling's cousin (and former WHS student) Kasey Watson, 18, fought in the junior men's weight class of 83kg and the open weight, taking silver and bronze respectively.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as the Watson's, Whanganui's Marshall Littlefair, 10, did well in the senior boys 32kg division, winning bronze despite having his nose taped from an injury while competing on the day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another newcomer was Adam Frieslaar, 9, fighting in the junior boys 36kg grade, winning gold for the weight class against seven other competitors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The next domestic competition for the judokas will be the Auckland International Open, being held at ASB Stadium, July 29-30.</strong></p>
