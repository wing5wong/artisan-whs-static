Whanganui High School take out the Regional Show Quest competition

Last week Whanganui High School won the regional Show Quest competition in Palmerston North against four secondary schools, including Whanganui Girls College and four Intermediate schools. It might sound straightforward, but not when you consider the amount of work put in by senior students in developing their theme, in the endless practises, the gathering and creation of costumes and not to forget the support of the teacher in charge of drama – Devon Adam.

Hunter Whitlock and Zoe Bullock, the Heads of Culture for the school, were the ones who came up with the theme and title – ‘The Women of Ward 5: Hear their Cries.’ It tells the sad story of what happened at Seacliff Mental Hospital, just north of Dunedin, in a fire on 8 December 1942, when 37 women patients lost their lives.

Their performance also covers some of the treatments or mistreatments meted out back then, including lobotomies. (These were surgical procedures severing the nerve pathways in the brain. They are now considered one of the most barbaric procedures in the history of modern medicine.)

Hunter and Zoe were researching natural disasters and tragedies and decided to highlight the Seacliff fire, partially because “it is not widely known. One main reason for the tragedy was that because of underfunding, the staff would lock the doors and windows of Ward 5 at night time, checking only once an hour.”

Once they had created the scenes, they had to search for songs to fit and then to choreograph the show; this is where fellow year 13 student Toby Clark, Head Boy, came in as stage manager. The Music and Dance departments were involved.

Practices for the 72 participants started in the term one school holidays and continued throughout term two, four  times a week. About 180 costumes were needed and they recycled some from previous productions, borrowed some from Amdram, and some were made either by themselves or by one of the teachers. Then they all had to be ironed for the show.

On Thursday, May 30, they were at the Regent on Broadway in Palmerston North rehearsing, and then at 8.30pm, they were on – the last group to perform.

The New Zealand champion school will be selected by the judges watching the videos of all the regional winners.

There will be an opportunity for Whanganui people to watch their performance when High School has its Performing Art Concert at the Opera House, probably at the end of term 3.
