Our senior boys basketball team finished their tournament today in Palmerston Nth. They finished 15th. 

Five of the team had representative rugby today so could not take part in the last games. 

A big thank you to Karney and Julie Herewini who have travelled everyday back and forth to Palmerston Nth with our Junior and Senior teams this week. 

End of an error for our Y13 boys in the team. 

💛💚🏀🏀
