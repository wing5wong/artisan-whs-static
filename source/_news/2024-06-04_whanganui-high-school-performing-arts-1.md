“Contestants adorned in sparkled boots, cowboy hats and sequined dresses met a roaring crowd at Saturday night's Gold Guitar Junior and Intermediate Finals.

The competition, held at the Gore Town and Country Club Stadium, honoured the next generation of Aotearoa's country music talent, with performers as young as 11 taking the stage.

Months of practice and an intense auditioning period made for a pitch-perfect evening - and paid off for two contestants on the night.

Canterbury's Briar Sharp was awarded a haul of Gold Guitars for the Junior category, including awards for best Gospel, Vocal Solo, and Junior overall, while Wanganui High School, Sophie Toyne (Year 10) was crowned Intermediate overall winner.

Both contestants were elated to receive the coveted Gold Guitar trophies and a cash prize, but it went even further for Toyne - the recipient of a comprehensive prize package of any young artist's dreams. It included an acoustic guitar, a fully produced single and video clip, a photoshoot, a publicity package and return airfare to Australia's Tamworth Country Music Festival”.
