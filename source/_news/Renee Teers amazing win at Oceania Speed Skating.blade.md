<h3>Whanganui speed skater Renee Teers was one of the stars of the Oceania Speed Skating Championships in Brisbane, Australia over Easter.</h3>
<p>Although the New Zealand team went down to the Australians 1298 points to 1048 in a close fought competition, Teers played her part for New Zealand by winning the overall Junior Girls Championship.</p>
<h3>In a closely fought class the Whanganui teenager won the 15km Elimination and the 42km Marathon as well as anchoring the New Zealand No1 Relay team to victory.</h3>
<p><strong>Teers sealed her overall win by also placing second to Australian speedster Asha Hickford in the 200mTT and the 1 lap sprint and second to Kiwi teammate</strong> Charlotte Clarke of Timaru in the 1000m.</p>
<p><strong>Teers</strong>' Marathon effort was a particularly cherished win after she led a breakaway group to a half lap lead after 10km but was forced to go it alone for a while before being chased down by the pelaton. She then regrouped to lead home the finishing sprint from Charli Nevin and Charlotte Clark both of Timaru.</p>
<p>Whanganui cadet boys Drew Brennan, <strong>Chase Morpeth</strong> and Josh Valentine had their work cut out in a class full of older and larger Australians. The trio got on the podium with a silver for Brennan and <strong>Morpeth</strong> and a bronze for Valentine in the relays but were unable to crack the Australian domination in the individual events.</p>
<p>Brennan turned in an outstanding effort in the 21km half marathon battling all the way with the Australian leaders and finishing fourth and first New Zealand skater home only 2 seconds off the winner Oscar Skidmore of Australia.</p>
<p>Valentine was equally impressive finishing 7th and second New Zealander home with Morpeth 8th in a field of 15. Being both the smallest and youngest skaters in their age group the trio can afford to bide their time.</p>
<p>While Brennan and Valentine head home for a well earned off season break, <strong>Chase Morpeth</strong> is headed to Colorado USA this week for a round of their National Championships and <strong>Teers</strong> returns to step up her training in preparation for the World Junior Championships in Barcelona Spain in July.</p>
