<p>Mark Stoneman, mayor Hamish McDouall and Karen Hobbs slake their thirst at the new fountain watched by Whanganui High School students at their 'Fun Day' at Cooks Gardens on Thursday 8 December.</p>
<p>It's come too late for Peter Snell but, after 120 years of sporting endeavour, Cooks Gardens finally has a water fountain to help athletes keep cool.</p>
<p>Whanganui's iconic sports stadium - which first saw action in 1896 - had its fountain declared flowing yesterday by mayor Hamish McDouall.</p>
<p>The idea came from Karen Hobbs, of the Whanganui Events Trust which runs the stadium, and the funding came from the PowerCo Trust.</p>
<p>"What a perfect day to announce this initiative," said Mark Stoneman, board chairman of the events trust, as the sun shone down on the venue where Peter Snell famously broke the world mile record in January 1962.</p>
<p>"I'm thrilled that everyone who now uses Cooks Gardens has the chance to enjoy a sip of water or the chance to fill their water bottle," Mr McDouall said.</p>
<p>And 500 students from Whanganui high schools were on hand to enjoy a day of athletics ... and keep refreshed at the fountain.</p>
