<p><span>TEAMMATES: &nbsp;Former WHS student, Wanganui's Chris Sharrock (left) and Indonesian student Ernest Sulivan collect the Taranaki Badminton Open men's doubles trophy at the weekend.</span></p>
<p>WANGANUI athlete Chris Sharrock put his teaching into practice at the weekend to win two titles at the Taranaki Badminton Open.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old, who turns 20 next week, is in his second year studying Sport and Exercise majoring in Coaching and Sports Management at Massey University.</p>
<p>During his time in Palmerston North, where he is also on the committee of the Manawatu Badminton Association, and vice-president of the Massey University Badminton Club, Sharrock met and teamed up with his doubles partners for the Taranaki Open.</p>
<p>He entered the singles, men's doubles and the mixed doubles. After getting knocked out in the semifinal of the men's singles, Sharrock won the men's doubles with partner Ernest Sulivan and mixed doubles, with Rowena Devathasan.</p>
<p>"Ernest is from Indonesia and is here studying at IPC [International Pacific College] and Rowena is from Auckland studying to become a vet at Massey," Sharrock said yesterday.</p>
<p>"I actually knew Rowena before through rep games and national tournaments. She is one of the top women players in the country, so it was great to partner her rather than play against her this time."</p>
<p>The former Wanganui High School student is also a talented cricketer and is a current member of the Wanganui rep side. He also has a strong background in coaching badminton and is the current coach of the Manawatu Under-21 team who finished fourth of 16 at the national age group teams championships.</p>
<p>"Following the teams nationals I was invited to be a guest/assistant coach for the New Zealand Under-19 and Under-15 teams' training boot camp over three days in Palmerston North under national senior coach Peter Jensen," Sharrock said.</p>
<p>His coaching experience dates back to his younger years in Wanganui, though.</p>
<p>"I played rep badminton in Wanganui for seven years while at Wanganui Intermediate School and WHS growing up. In 2012, at 17, I was coaching the Wanganui Under-17s and have been juggling playing and coaching ever since."</p>
