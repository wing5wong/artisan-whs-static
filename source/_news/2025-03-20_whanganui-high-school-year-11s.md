Our year 11s had a great time throughout the tramping and camping unit. They tramped through the Old Coach Road to the Mangawhero campsite carrying all the equipment and resources that they would need for the 2 days. The hike that day was around 22km which was super impressive! The second day consisted of off track navigation using a compass and a map which was great fun!
