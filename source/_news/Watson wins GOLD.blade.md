<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL STARS: Whanganui brothers Callaghan and WHS student Keightley Watson (right) are the golden boys of open international judo competition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whanganui siblings Keightley and Callaghan Watson have yet again dealt to an international field of rivals on Australian soil.</strong></p>
<p>The brothers, both members of the Wanganui Judo Club, returned home from competing at the Melbourne International Judo Open in Broadmeadows at the weekend sporting gold.</p>
<p>Eleven-year-old Callaghan Watson, fighting in the Junior Boys over 50kg weight class took the gold medal adding to the gold he won at the Queensland International Open and silver in the ACT Judo International earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>Older sibling, 15-year-old Keightley won gold in the Cadet plus 90kg grade earlier in the morning then went on later in the day to take gold in the Young Men's plus 100kg division.</strong></p>
<p>Father Ross Watson said his older son was then invited to fight in the Senior Men's plus 100kg class where he won silver.</p>
<p>"Given this is his first year fighting in the cadets, which is his main age division, and taking gold this year in the ACT International Open, Queensland International Open, Auckland International Open and now the Melbourne International Open, we will see if he can continue his winning way in the Sydney International next month.</p>
<p>The travel certainly is showing no ill effects with their fighting in Australia," Watson senior said.</p>
