**Dr Bronwyn Labrum** is the new director of the Whanganui Regional Museum and brings to the position a wealth of experience and range of skills. She has a PhD in History as well as a postgraduate Certificate in Tertiary Teaching. She has been a researcher for the Waitangi Tribunal, an Associate Professor in the School of Design at Massey University and, most recently, Head of New Zealand and Pacific Cultures at Te Papa. She has also written books on New Zealand’s social and cultural history.

Fortunately, Bronwyn was born and bred in Whanganui going to Keith St School and **Whanganui High School**. Her background here was one of the reasons she applied for the job. She also wanted the opportunity “to run the show, to put into play ideas I have developed and to build on the great platform that the museum has built up.”

It is a case of “lifting the profile of the museum further.”  And she would like to do it in conjunction with the Sarjeant Gallery, the libraries on Pukenamu Queens Park and the War Memorial Centre, as well as the Royal Wanganui Opera House, which is close by, transforming the area into “a heritage centre unprecedented in the country. It would be an opportunity to stage an exhibition and offer experiences in more than one site.” She is also interested in working more closely with heritage groups/services such as the PS Waimarie.

In the immediate future, Bronwyn has plans to make the exterior of the Museum building more attractive and appealing, responding to feedback that tells her many visitors focus on the Taupo Quay area and have little to no idea where the Museum is. She says, “Even when you come to Watt Street, you need to come close to the entrance before concluding that you have arrived at the Museum.” 

So expect an external repaint complete with banners, photographs and information displayed boldly on the outside to give visitors more idea of what they will see and experience on the inside.

Bronwyn adds, “We need to reconnect with different groups in our community – teenagers, young adults, families, local iwi.” Her motto is, “The museum is there for the people, not for itself.”

Part of this connection is a focus on new acquisitions related to the city and the region. “Throughout its long history we collected anything from anywhere in the world. Instead we want to focus on being a regional museum and collect items that might have been made here, bought here, used here and preferably with a story about the person or people the item is linked to. We are collecting now for the future.”

“We have a strong collection of early 20th century items but not mid to late 20th century, especially in male and children’s items and, for example, in shoes. We need to have and show these, to stay relevant and reflect a range of histories and experiences,” she explains. A particular area of interest for Bronwyn is in clothing. As a youngster she made her own clothing and when she was first at Te Papa (1996-2000), she had the role of Curator, History and Textiles. The title of one of her books is ‘Looking Flash: Clothing in Aotearoa New Zealand.’

She is planning an ‘Outfit of the month’ display with the first display being a female, famous and interesting, of the 1930s. Personally, I’m looking forward to a male dressed in the 1960s/70s style with winkle-picker shoes and a bright green suit where the lapel stretched across the shoulders and with bell bottomed trousers.

There are also critical positions to fill, including a Natural History Curator, vacant since Mike Dickison left in 2018, and the position of Taonga Māori curator. There is also a need for a part time marketing and communications person.

Bronwyn recognizes that, “we need to seek alternative sources of funding and look for philanthropic people who would be prepared to sponsor an exhibition or an experience.”

Despites COVID and lockdowns over the past year, the Museum has remained a popular place to visit. “Currently we are at 87% of our annual average visitor numbers. In the circumstances I’m pretty pleased with that,” says Bronwyn, who will be hoping to see a steady increase over the next year.

Dr Bronwyn Labrum will be writing a regular column for the RCP on the museum and all its activities, including collecting and exhibitions. Look out for the articles and make the Museum a regular place to visit.
