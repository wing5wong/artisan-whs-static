<p><span>EARLY DAYS: &nbsp;Martin Atkinson (right), newest selection for the New Zealand Under-23 team, back when still playing for Tech College Old Boys at Gonville Domain.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui hockey export and former WHS student Martin Atkinson will grasp the opportunity to join a newly created New Zealand youth team with both hands after his selection in the NZ Futures Under 23 squad to play Australia in a five-test series in November.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old, who came back from Auckland to represent Wanganui in the Central tournament this year and still plays for the Central Mavericks in the National Hockey League under region of origin, will be one of five midfielders in the new look national side.</p>
<p>He scored a goal in the Mavericks final game of the NHL last Sunday, a 5-1 win over Northland.</p>
<p>The 20-man New Zealand U23 team will consist of 10 players who are Under 20, thus eligible for next year's Junior World Cup, plus five players in their final year of Under 21 and five more, including Atkinson, aged 21-23.</p>
<p>Atkinson made the 30-man wider Junior World Cup squad in 2013 while still playing club hockey in Wanganui, however missed selection in coach Grant Edwards' final 18 to go to India.</p>
<p>Since then, he has moved up to Auckland to play club hockey and had set his sights on trying to break into New Zealand senior development team.</p>
<p>Therefore, he welcomed the creation of another tier of youth squad for this Australia series, which will help players underneath the bubble of national selection to keep motivated and working after they turn 21.</p>
<p>"In the previous years, there's been nothing for the players after Under 21, even up to 25, if they're on the verge of that development team.</p>
<p>"The main goal [in this team] is to be seen, really. By all the coaches and all that, and hopefully it will have a tick by my name."</p>
<p>The head coach is Bryce Collins, who will be assisted by Simon Brill.</p>
<p>The son of local hockey stalwart Langley Atkinson, currently coaching the Wanganui High School team, Martin Atkinson said it has been a good two years playing in Auckland.</p>
<p>"I think I've improved quite dramatically. Club hockey here is a step above the Manawatu league.</p>
<p>"The Black Sticks come back and play when they can."</p>
<p>When he is not doing team trainings, which is most of the time, Atkinson hits the gym as much as possible.</p>
<p>With the exception of the younger guys, he knows the majority of this Under 23 team as either former team mates or opponents.</p>
<p>They are expecting the Australian squad to be similar - those looking for selection for next year's Junior World Cup, plus a few promising older players just below the senior test team.</p>
<p>First on the agenda will be raising some funds to help cover the $2500 costs for the trip.</p>
<p>Atkinson is waiting to hear back from people who may have memorabilia to raffle off, while also looking at sponsorships.</p>
<p>The five matches will be played in the capital city of Canberra, November 19-27.</p>
