For many years Whanganui High School’s Vocational Studies department has been endeavouring to deliver Drivers Licences into their student’s teaching timetable. Students in this programme participate in work experience and attend off-site courses to further their career education. While at work placements many students have been offered employment but due to some of them not having their licence it has meant that they have not been able to secure these positions.

This year the department was approached by Jodie and Ernie Te Waaka from Awa Driving and an agreement was reached where they would come into school for one hour every week and teach the year 12 and 13 Vocational Studies students’ the road code. This has been a tremendous success with all but two students going for and passing the various tests for either their Learners or Restricted, making them more employable.

Two Gateway students have work placements with GOME (Grumpy Old Men Enterprise) and the school has formed a wonderful relationship with this group of volunteers. GOME heard about the Whanganui High School drivers licence programme and offered to sponsor several students giving them financial assistance which helped pay the licence fee. 

The students decided they would like to thank GOME for their generosity and met up with them during their “smoko break” last week bringing them a morning tea shout. The students and the school are very grateful to them for their support.
