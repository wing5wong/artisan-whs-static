Whanganui High School’s Visual Arts department has had success in recent prestigious art awards. Year 12 students, **Zoe Bracegirdle and Rose Hird** (for the second year in a row), were selected as finalists for the 2020 National Youth Awards. **Grace Swanston**, (Year 13) has also been selected as a finalist for the Wallace Secondary School Art Awards. Grace’s self-portrait is titled ‘Behind the glass’ and uses the mediums of pencil, water colour, acrylic and coffee. **Grace’s artwork will be exhibited at the Wallace Arts Centre, Pah Homestead in Auckland, from 1 October to 1 November.**

Art designs that students made during our House Activity Week have been recently installed in our school library. These designs portray the colours of the school’s four Houses with regional and national themes, creating an invigorating and inviting space which proudly displays our student talent.

Whanganui High School’s Visual Arts Department has a purpose-built arts facility which has been designed as a future proof-environment, completely redesigned within the last few years to create a flow of workspaces that allow for a range of dynamic teaching experiences. Students move between a range of specialised teaching spaces to work on design, painting and printmaking projects. A dedicated design space of high-end computers allows for an integrated digital approach. The print room houses two large bed etching and woodcut presses, a dedicated silkscreen exposure unit and a vinyl cutter. An extensive collection of art resource books are located in an art library where students move to gather additional resource material. The central hallway has been designed with gallery lighting where student and staff work can be proudly showcased. 

This ambient atmosphere, as well as the experience from our dedicated and skilled teaching staff has helped promote the talented skill set of our visual art students. Future students and their families are welcome to tour through our teaching spaces by ringing the school office on 06-349-0178.
