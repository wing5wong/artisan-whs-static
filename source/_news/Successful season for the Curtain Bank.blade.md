<p><br />The last day for the Curtain Bank is on Tuesday, June 4. It is at the All Saints Hall in Wanganui East, opposite 4 Square and will be open from 2.30 to 5pm. The bank has assisted over 50 families and at least 200 people. Most families had someone under five years old and someone with a chronic health condition.<span class="text_exposed_show"><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The bank received a generous donation of curtains from the Curtain Bank in Palmerston North to start with and since then has received a great supply of curtains from the community including a big donation from Collegiate Motor Inn and a retirement home which was refurbishing their units.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">All curtains are checked and measured and placed in lots of the same or similar size. Danny Lebo says that they have had many volunteers from the community, some helping to unpack donations, others organising or providing advice.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Each recipient is given leaflets about moisture and condensation and what to do about them as well as instructions on how to hang curtains.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Danny says, &ldquo;It is amazing what you can do with no budget. We were given the use of the church hall, the community supplied the curtains and volunteers helped man the bank.&rdquo; There was an opportunity for people to give donations and Danny says, &ldquo;These will be used to run a workshop or bring in a speaker.&rdquo;</span></p>
