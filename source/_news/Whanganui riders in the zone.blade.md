<p>Two riders from the Wanganui Petre Pony Club stepped up the pace after qualifying for Zone Games earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>Ella Kingston</strong> riding Miss Eve and Adrienne Swan on Sonrise Essence finished a creditable third in the Junior Pairs when competing against nine pony clubs from throughout the lower North Island at Stratford.</p>
<p><strong>Kingston</strong> and Swan had qualified for the step up to Zone level at a Wanganui Petre Pony Club-hosted Area Games earlier in the season.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, club secretary Debra Kingston upcoming events such as the show hunter series (18 June) and Petre mini show (15 October) were ideal vehicles to showcase the benefits of membership.</p>
<p><strong>"All riders and spectators are welcome to come to any of our events and I would invite people keen on horses to join our facebook page. We always welcome new members and people can join as non-riders and work toward horse ownership if they choose," Kingston said.</strong></p>
