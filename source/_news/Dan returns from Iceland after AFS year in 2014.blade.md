<p>Daniel Kari came to Whanganui from Iceland in 2014 for a year at Whanganui High School under the AFS banner. He loved the experience, especially his host parents, Simon and Jenny Mead, that he returned early this year for another three-month stint.</p>
<p>Looking back at his time at High School, Dan praises &ldquo;the well organised international department&rdquo; and the trips he went on with them including the Tongariro crossing and<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;to Mt Taranaki. He says, &ldquo;Students here have a much wider range of subjects to choose from.&rdquo; As he was here mainly for the experience, he chose subjects such as drama, food and nutrition and two classes of dance.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">It was understandable that Dan wanted to experience dance classes here as he started dance tuition when he was only four. He explains, &ldquo;In Iceland it was mainly ballroom and Latin but dances like hip hop here.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Soon after he returned to his hometown of Kopavogur (part of the larger capital city of Reykjavik), he started teaching dance, along with selling suits and working as a chef. He remained in touch with Simon and Jenny, who had introduced him to dance teacher Mark Glastonbury, as both of them were keen dancers.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">He decided to come back to Whanganui but asked Jenny to keep it a secret. Mark picked him up from the airport and just before the Mead&rsquo;s house, he hopped into the boot. Mark told Simon he had a motor bike engine in the boot and could he take it out. Dan loved the expression on Simon&rsquo;s face when he saw him.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Dan had helped Mark at his Glastonbury Dance Studio, partnering some of the girls including one from Lower Hutt, who came to Mark every week. Dan would practise with her for four hours on a Sunday.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">He learnt English at school from aged 10, although students start at age six now, he adds. A year in Whanganui did wonders for his fluency. He is grateful for the huge support he has received from his parents and from Simon and Jenny. The parents of the students at the Dance Studio are also &ldquo;very nice people.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Another trip back to Whanganui is on the cards for next year, although airfares are not cheap. His return trip to London cost him $2650 and to get to Iceland can cost from $80 to $3000 extra.<br /></span></p>
