The annual Bike Wise Whanganui programme returns for February. As part of the month there is the ‘Aotearoa Bike Challenge which asks you to do 10 minutes or more of riding your bike as often as you can over the month. Go to www.aotearoa.bike for details and to register.

One incentive to do your riding is the ‘Tour de Whanganui’ sponsored by Velo Ronny’s. Complete four stages on the river trails during February and go in a draw to win prizes including a bike. Download a record sheet from www.veloronnys.co.nz.

There are programmes to encourage your kids to gain bike riding skills and for you to ‘Get Back on your Bike.’

There are group bike rides to do including a ‘Guided Art-themed Ride’ on Monday, February 8 at 6pm. It stops at various art sculptures along the way. Another is ‘Ride to the North Mole’ on Wednesday, February 10 and ‘Ride to Upokongaro Café’ on Sunday, February 28 starting at 10am. For all these rides and others you can contact Michelle if you need a bike. So no excuses! Her details are michelle@letsgowhanganui.org.nz.

If you prefer to watch bikes or hopefully watch bikes as well as ride them, you have some options. There is ‘The Big Bike Film Night on Friday, February 19 from 7pm to 9.20pm at the Davis Theatre. They promise the “best cycling films from around the world.” Tickets cost $13 to $18.

Then there is the Rivercity Wheelrace run by the Whanganui Cycling Club at Cooks Gardens. It is the 72nd  running of these races. Free entry to spectators.

The Kiwi Kids Bike Race – actually three of them - start on February 28. These are for kids from 3 to 13 years.

For those who look forward to the ‘National Go By Bike Day on Wednesday, February 10, when a free breakfast is served up to all who arrive by bike from 7 to 9am, the pancakes are on again  at the Cornmarket Reserve, corner of Dublin and Pitt Street. If you are having doubts about your bike, there will be free bike checks, courtesy of Green Bikes. 

Last but not least is the annual ‘Frocks on Bikes’ event on Saturday, March 13 at 3.30pm. Dress up in your finest frock, suit or superhero costume and join in a fun adventure around town for just a gold coin entry. All wheels without engines are welcome.
