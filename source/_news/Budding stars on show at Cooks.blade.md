<p><span>MULTI TALENTED: Promising track runner Paris Munro proved she was also a dab hand at high jumping during the Whanganui High School Junior Track and Field Championships at Cooks Gardens yesterday.</span></p>
<p>Budding track and fields stars were on show during the annual Whanganui High School Junior Track and Field Championships at Cooks Gardens yesterday.</p>
<p>WHS sport co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said upwards of 600 Year 9 and Year 10 students descended on the venue - some in a more serious frame of mind aiming to achieve higher honours.</p>
<p>"It's all about participation, but it also gives us the chance to spot track and field talent early," Murphy said yesterday.</p>
<p>"Each of the disciplines have a benchmark to hit and the top 10 in each that reach the mark move on to our senior competition next Wednesday. From there we select our team to compete in the Whanganui Secondary Schools Track and Field Championships.</p>
<p>"It's very important at this age to identify early talent so that it can be taken through to senior level and developed."</p>
<p>All the traditional track and field disciplines were on offer yesterday including sprint and staying tests on the track, while long jump, high jump, triple, javelin and discus were on the menu in the field. On the fun side gumboot throwing and a tug-o-war proved popular with the masses.</p>
<p>Cooks Gardens moved into school championships mode late last month where Cullinane competed with at least three school records broken. Whanganui Girls' College followed last Thursday, while Wanganui Collegiate have had their all action Inter House Team Match on Saturday. The WHS seniors have their chance to shine on Wednesday next week.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Schools Championships are scheduled for Wednesday, March 15, which is the qualifying meet for the North Island Schools in April.</p>
