Many people relax during their summer holidays, chilling with friends and travelling with family members. 

Instead, I attended the Rotary National Science & Technology Forum, meeting 173 other high achieving students from across the country and learning more about the different university courses and careers available in the ever-growing science and technology industry. 

During this 2-week program, we visited different universities within Auckland and were given insight from the lecturers and professors into many different modules. Through these I got a taste of what course my future could take and the possible study pathways I would like to look further into. Accompanying these academic modules were competitive rounds of volleyball between the different colour groups (well done to purple for winning the competition!) and early morning activities, my personal favourite being the ‘Elite Boys Club Walking’. Outside of the modules, we got to enjoy a beach day and different fun activities that Auckland has to offer, like rock climbing, laser tag and escape rooms. 

The greatest thing by far about this camp was definitely the people; whether it be those you’ve been with from the very beginning, or the coincidental elevator trips to collect laundry together while making brief conversations - the people made the forum truly fantastic. 

I had an amazing time at the forum - here’s to the new wisdom I gained and the memories I made with some of the best people I have ever met that’ll last with me for a lifetime! 

I would like to express a massive thanks to the Whanganui Rotary Club for the partial sponsorship of this opportunity, your help was greatly appreciated. 

I’m always grateful for the guidance of Mr Crook – thank you for your coordination!
