In terms of Manu Korero because we were on stage with Teri-ellen I wasn't able to capture her performance however I am waiting for the recordings and photographs to be released by the organising committee. A brief summary though, Teri-ellen's stand was calm, composed, structured and well delivered. She rose to the challenge and if there were any nerves going on for her, she managed them well as it did not show. We didn't place but Teri-ellen walked away with a rich cultural experience in Te Ao Maaori, seeing rangatahi like herself and others to potentially aspire to. A big thank you to her whaanau who have been alongside us throughout the whole journey.  It was a team effort. 

 

Te Roopuu o Te Puna Ora definitely made their presence known at this years Paerangatahi Kapa Haka competition. Their stand was precise, sharp and well composed. The stage was full of young rangatahi from both WHS AND WCC, some experienced and others their first stand. Being a new group and having to perform first presented some challenges and although we did not place in the top 3, the real winner as told to us by our amazing tutors are our schools coming together for whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, manaakitanga and of course to keep our Rangatahi engaged in Maaori performing Arts, and Te Ao Maaori whaanui. 

 

We are still humbled to have received the invitation 6 weeks out from the competition, we are proud of the stand our kids made on that stage, and of course that would never have been possible without the grace, beauty, waiata and kapa haka skills and qualities of our Whaea Teresa Tepania and the precise skills and expertise particularly in Mau Rakau, Haka and Burpees of Matua Taniwha Mihaka. 

 

E kore too taato puna aroha e mimiti mo taatou, engari he Puna e ora ai ana mo ake tonu atu!

 

Tuu ki runga Te Roopuu o Te Puna Ora i runga i te ngakau mahaki, ao mai poo mai!
