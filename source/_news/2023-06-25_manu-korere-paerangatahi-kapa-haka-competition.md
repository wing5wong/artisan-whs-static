The Manu Korero competition was held in Palmerston North on Friday 23 June. Teri-ellen Karipa’s performance was calm, composed, structured and well delivered.  She rose to the challenge and walked away with a rich cultural experience in Te Ao Maaori A big thank you to her whaanau who have been alongside us throughout the whole journey.  It was a team effort. 

 The Paerangatahi Kapa Haka competition was held on Saturday 24 June. This was the first time our Whanganui High School and Whanganui City College Te Roopuu o Te Puna Ora were performing and competing together.  They drew first to perform and this presented some challenges.  Unfortunately they didn’t place but the real winner was our schools coming together for whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, manaakitanga and of course to keep our Rangatahi engaged in Maaori performing Arts, and Te Ao Maaori whaanui. 

 A big thank you to Whaea Teresa Tepania for her precise skills and expertise in teaching our group, particularly in Mau Rakau, Haka and Burpees of Matua Taniwha Mihaka.
