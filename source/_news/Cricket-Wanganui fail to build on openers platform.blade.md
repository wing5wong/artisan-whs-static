<p>Wanganui opener Jess Watkins lines up a shot on her way to a half-century against Hawke's Bay in the regional under-18 girls cricket tournament.</p>
<p>A solid foundation laid by Wanganui openers Jess Watkins and Harriett Williams was not enough to chase down Hawke's Bay in the regional girls under-18 cricket tournament.</p>
<p>The visitors scored 192/7 from their 30 overs in yesterday's morning clash at Tasman Tanning Victoria Park, Sophie Pyott top scoring with 69.</p>
<p>In reply Wanganui couldn't score fast enough to run down Hawke's Bay's total.</p>
<p>Watkin and Williams put on 56 without loss in the first 10 overs before Williams fell in the 11th over for 5. When Watkins fell for 54 six overs later the scoring slowed, with Wanganui finishing on 124/5.</p>
<p>Wanganui were to play Manawatu in the afternoon game yesterday. Playoffs begin today.</p>
<p>In other morning games St Albans chased Manawatu's 104 all out in 23 overs for the loss of five wickets while Taranaki, who scored 171/3, hammered Wairarapa who were all out for 84.</p>
