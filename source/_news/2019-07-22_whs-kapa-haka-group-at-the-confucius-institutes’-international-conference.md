Tēnā kotou katoa,

On Thursday, 27 June I had the privilege of being part of our school support team in Opunake as Roman Kotuhi-Brown (Year 10) won the Rāwhiti Ihaka Junior Māori section of the Whanganui/Taranaki regional Ngā Manu Kōrero competition.  Roman will now compete in the national championships in Palmerston North on 12 September.

On Wednesday, 3 July I travelled to Wellington with 24 student members of our Kapa Haka group, Lynaire Simon (Kapa Haka tutor), Sean Brown (Māori Dean), Cherie Cowan-Puru (Kaiāwhina) and Beck Ding (Chinese teacher and International Dean).  Whanganui High School is a Confucius Classroom school and our Kapa Haka group had been invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the Confucius Institutes’ International Conference – Hunter University Council Chamber, Victoria University of Wellington.

The opening ceremony on the morning of Thursday, 4 July was an absolutely fantastic experience for all involved.  Our students performed at a high level to the world-wide head of Confucius Institutes as well as a wide range of people from Chinese Universities, Australian and New Zealand Universities.  Our students and staff received excellent feedback from the various university representatives as we mixed and mingled together at the conference morning tea after the conclusion of the opening ceremony and speeches.

Ngā mihi nui,
