Pippa McKee competed in the Artistic Roller Skating, 2021 East Central / West Central Regionals on 10 and 11 April.

Pippa hadn't competed in 3 years on that floor in Upper Hutt and was very nervous, but elated and proud when she received two Silver Medals! 👍

🥈  Cadet Figures  
🥈  Cadet Solo Dance & Freedance

Great effort Pippa, congratulations! 👏👏
