<p><span>Well done to our WHS girls sevens rugby team who had some great games today in New Plymouth in the qualifying round for Condors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Girls ended up 2nd equal but missed qualifying for Condors on a goal differential. Awesome work girls!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to Denning Tyrell (coach) and Marie and Papa Aki Vaiao (manager) for looking after the girls and to the parents who went to support.</span></p>
