<p><span>KICKS MATTER: Mitch Millar's boot helped the Wanganui High School 1st XV into the Manawatu Colts final with a 24-22 win over Linton.</span></p>
<p>A big week few days for the Wanganui High School 1st XV starts this afternoon when they play cross-town rivals Wanganui Collegiate. But, perhaps, a bigger match lies on the horizon with their Manawatu Colts Gordon Brown Cup final against Massey White in Palmerston North on Saturday.</p>
<p>The high school side earned their place in the decider after a tight 24-22 win over Linton in Saturday's home semifinal. WHS had prepared well for the match and they were quickly into their work. A good run from Blair Osborne, with an offload to Daniel Kauika, created the first try; converted by Mitchell Millar.</p>
<p>Kauika was in again soon after, with the home side creating space and moving the ball well.</p>
<p>But third-placegetters Linton showed heart to haul WHS back in with two tries before halftime, cutting High School's lead to just two points at the break.</p>
<p>Then the visitors snatched a 17-12 lead with the first try of the second half.</p>
<p>Tom Gibson regained the lead for WHS, scoring in the corner, for Miller to add the extras, before Linton hit back with an unconverted try.</p>
<p>Corbin Warren finished the scoring to end the match at four tries apiece, the boot of Miller the difference.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Collegiate-Wanganui High School match kicks off at 2.30pm at Collegiate.</p>
