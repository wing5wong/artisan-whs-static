<p class="element element-paragraph">Seven students from UCOL Whanganui's School of Design have used the paint medium to explore aspects of their personal lives.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The works are on display in the atrium at Whanganui UCOL and each student has produced work that reflects their own experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lecturer Lorraine Webb gave her second year students a brief to research the work of two established artists from a list that includes Kura te Waru Rewiri, Katharina Grosse, Kristine Moran, Michael Simpson and Ngatai Taepa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The students were required to use acrylic or oil paints on flat or three-dimensional surfaces exploring themes of culture and emotions, myths and legends, public places, city maps, etc.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mina Bourke chose Kowhai Park as the subject for her series entitled&nbsp;<em>Kowhai Toanga</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I chose to use bright acrylic paints to illustrate the recognisable features of the park but I have experimented with the perspectives."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sonia Forsey's works are black on white and her partner and son are the subjects although only the lower parts of their faces are visible as they stand clutching new-laid eggs in their backyard.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wanted them to look like black and white photos."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The project is intended to develop the students' exploration and manipulation of materials, scale and surface.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Hybrid Painting works are on display in the UCOL atrium during campus hours.</strong></p>
