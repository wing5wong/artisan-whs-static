<h4>A Paid Union Meeting on Tuesday 25 June 2019</h4>
<p><br />Tēnā kotou katoa&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have received notification from the Secretary for Education and the PPTA General Secretary that Paid Union Meetings are happening throughout New Zealand between 24 and 28 June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been informed by the PPTA General Secretary that all Whanganui and Manawatu secondary school teachers who are members of the PPTA will be attending a Paid Union Meeting at 1.00 pm on Tuesday, 25 June in Palmerston North.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers who are members of the PPTA will need to leave school by 11.50 am to attend the meeting in time.&nbsp; As a consequence, we will be unable to provide teaching instruction to all our students from 11.50 am onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will, however, be able to provide <strong>supervision</strong> and limited teaching instruction by a small group of non-union teachers to students who wish to remain at school after 11.50 am on Tuesday.&nbsp; Students in this situation will need to meet in the Library at 11.50 am to receive further instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that our school buses are running at their <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">normal times</span></strong> due to the need to transport primary and intermediate age children at the usual times after school finishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Martin McAllen<br /></em><strong>PRINCIPAL</strong></p>
