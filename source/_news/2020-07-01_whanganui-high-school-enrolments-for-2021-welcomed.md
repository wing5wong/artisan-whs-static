Students, staff and whānau at Whanganui High School consistently put in the hard mahi together to ensure we are able to regularly celebrate outstanding academic, cultural and sporting successes.

All students are given the opportunity and support required to reach their potential in all aspects of their education through our school values of **LIFE** – **L**earning (Ako); **I**ntegrity (Mana); **F**ellowship (Manaakitanga); **E**xcellence (Kairangi).  We provide a future-focused education which enables all students to succeed.

Our graduating students will have the following attributes and skills:

•	The ability to communicate effectively with others;  
•	Be trustworthy, honest, reliable and dependable;  
•	Be respectful, caring and empathetic;  
•	Be open-minded and enthusiastic for learning new skills;  
•	Be independent, motivated, confident, persistent and resilient;  
•	Value cultural diversity – be inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds;  
•	Be literate and numerate;  
•	Have self-discipline.

Students at Whanganui High School enjoy a diverse range of high-quality educational opportunities; access to our dedicated and well-qualified teachers (and support staff); a fully inclusive and welcoming learning environment.

Students and parents are very welcome to visit our school and meet with me at any time.  Ideally, new enrolments for 2021 should be received at Whanganui High School by Friday, 3 July.

We are looking forward to welcoming all our new students and whānau to Whanganui High School at the beginning of the 2021 school year!
