<p>Globe-trotting Whanganui heavyweight judoka Keightley Watson has made the podium again with two medals at the 2019 Sydney Judo International.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following on his success in Canberra the previous weekend at the ACT Open, where he was jetlagged after just flying in from the Netherlands, Watson won the Junior Men's 100kg+ division.</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">In the Senior Men's 100kg+, this time Watson had to settle for silver, losing to the Australian and Oceania No1 ranked heavyweight Liam Park, who he had beaten in the semifinals the previous week.</h3>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Younger brother Callaghan Watson also competing in Sydney over the February 23-24 weekend and took bronze medal in the Senior Boys 66kg+ weight division.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>This time there were five competitors in the Junior 100kg+ competition, which is for Under 21's, including a member of the New Caledonia national squad, who had not been in Canberra.</strong></p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Watson proved too strong for Benjamin Allatt, David Put, and Sung Min Lee to win the gold.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 10-fighter Senior division, Watson defeated Paula Monta in the first round, and then won rematches against Allatt and Min Lee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He then matched up against with Park in the final, but this time the roles were reversed and he was narrowly beaten.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Ross Watson said both Canberra and Sydney had been a good gauge as to his son's ongoing improvement in last 12 months from training in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are still things he needs to work on, "but by far, he has more solutions on the mat now than before when competing because of it," said Ross Watson.</p>
<p>Keightley Watson will have no down time since arriving back home, as preparations begin for the Asia-Pacific Championships, being held April 20-22 in the United Emirates at Fujairah, where he will represent New Zealand in the 100kg+ Senior Men's team.</p>
