The local Roundtable Service Club recently assisted James Gray (17) a Whanganui High school pupil, to allow him to represent the New Zealand Junior small bore rifle team against Scotland and Australia in a postal competition this year.

James presented Roundtable President, Glenn Kearse, with a photograph as thanks. It shows James receiving his Silver Fern and NZ Representative Pocket as well as doing a shoot.

The ribbon and bar he's wearing donates this yearâ€™s international competitions. 

James will compete in the Brisbane Oceania Games in 2021 when he moves up to A Grade competition.
