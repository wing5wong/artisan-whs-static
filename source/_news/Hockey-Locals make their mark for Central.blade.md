<p><span>Former WHS student Martin Atkinson and WHS student Jordan Cohen in their Central Mavericks gear at the 2017 Ford National Hockey League tournament in Wellington last week.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Central squads with their Whanganui representatives came fifth and sixth at the conclusion of the 2017 Ford National Hockey League tournament in Wellington at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Expat Whanganui player and 2016 Black Stick Martin Atkinson was joined in the Central Mavericks by Jordan Cohen, stepping up from the Central Under 18 squad and at 17-years-old is believed to be the youngest ever local representative in the Central seniors for the NHL.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's Junior Black Stick <strong>Emma Rainey</strong>, who was MVP when the Central Under 18 women won their national title earlier in the season, took her place in the Central Mysticks lineup.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both <strong>Rainey and Cohen</strong>, along with Tech College Old Boy's <strong>Ryan Gray</strong>, have been selected for their New Zealand Under 18 training squads.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Wellington, <strong>Atkinson</strong> would be joint top goalscorer for his team with seven goals in six games, having reached 40 caps as one of the veterans in the Mavericks squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, coming off the bench, <strong>Cohen got two goals at his senior debut tournament</strong>. Starting the previous Saturday, the Mavericks were stung 3-0 by Auckland in their opening game, but rebounded to hammer Northland 7-1 on the Monday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Atkinson got two goals and picked up a green card, while Cohen made his five minutes off the bench count with a goal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Central completed Pool B in good shape with a 2-0 win over Canterbury on Wednesday, with Atkinson getting the winning goal in the 56th minute.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Entering the quarterfinals on Thursday, Central led the Southern Dogs 2-1 after 19 minutes, but gave up two second half goals to lose 3-2.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That set up another game with Northland on Saturday, and Central continued to run rampant with a 10-0 thrashing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Atkinson scored a hat trick of goals, with Cohen getting another only two minutes after the Black Stick had competed this trifeta in the 42nd minute.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That put Central into Sunday's playoff for fifth against Midlands, where despite the Mavericks leading 3-0 after 34 minutes with Atkinson's seventh goal on a reverse sweep from the top of circle, the floodgates opened at the end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Midlands scored four times in the last 12 minutes to win 4-3.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Goals would be very hard to come by for the Mysticks in the women's competition, where four of their six games would come down to a penalty shootout.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rainey got two goals for the team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She scored in the 14th minute of the opening Saturday game against North Harbour, who replied four minutes later and with a 1-1 deadlock at fulltime, North Habour won the shootout 3-1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Central were stung again on the Sunday when they were well beaten 4-1 by eventual champions Midlands, with their chances not helped by two yellow cards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Tuesday, Central were run down by Northland, who drew 2-2 with them after 53rd and 58th minute goals, and then won the fulltime shootout 3-1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Entering the playoffs, Central continued to have no luck as even with <strong>Rainey</strong> scoring immediately after Auckland's goal to tie the match 1-1 in the seventh minute, no further points were added and despite a better effort, Central lost the shootout 3-2 on the last attempt.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But not giving up, <strong>Rainey's</strong> team finally had the fates on their side against the Capital Cyclones, who had three green cards and two yellows drawn against them in the 1-1 draw, with Rainey coming off the bench this time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mysticks were able to call on all their shootout experiance to finally win it, 3-1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That put them into the playoff for fifth with Canterbury on Sunday, Rainey again on the bench, and in a very exciting match, Canterbury pulled their goalie when trailing 2-1, but Central got the turnover to feed their captain Kayla Whitelock to scored the matchwinner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Local representative hockey continues as the Wanganui Under 15 and Under 13 boys and girls teams will be heading away to their own tournaments in the coming week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They will play in Hawkes Bay, Auckland, Timaru and Invercargill respectively.</p>
