We had a successful ‘Showcase’ evening for our Senior Dance students. Students performed their Term 1 assessment routines to whanau showcasing what they have worked on throughout Term One. The majority of these routines were learnt at our successful combined schools workshops earlier in the Term. This evening allows students to experience performing to a live audience lifting their level of performance and developing their confidence throughout the year. We look forward [](<>)to another ‘Showcase’ in Term 3.
