<p>WANGANUI hockey is in excellent health with six teenagers selected for Central North Island under-18 duties at the nationals in July.</p>
<p><strong>Five of the six - four boys and two girls - have direct links with Wanganui High School and are regulars in the local competition.</strong></p>
<p>Joseph Redpath, Ryan Gray, Ben Pilet and Lee Moir have been selected to join the Central North Island under-18 boys squad, while Beth Norman and Emma Rainey have been named in the girls' team.</p>
<p>All, apart from Norman, are WHS players, although Moir now plays for Tech Old Boys since leaving school.</p>
<p>Norman came through the Collegiate programme and in the Saturday division one women's competition plays for College in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The four boys play for Tech on Saturdays, while Rainey lines up for Collegians.</p>
<p>Kylie Penn from Hockey Wanganui said having six players named in the Central teams was significant and a major achievement.</p>
<p>"Each year we may have one or two, but to have six is unusual and an excellent achievement," Penn said yesterday.</p>
<p>"Central has done okay at the nationals and look particularly strong this season.</p>
<p>"They played a warm-up match against Capital at the weekend.</p>
<p>"The girls drew one-all, but coach Jan Dixon said Central had several chances to take the game. The boys won something like 9-2 - a real thrashing."</p>
<p>Dixon and her husband are sheep and beef farmers in Turakina and she has a strong hockey background in Waikato during her playing days.</p>
<p>"We are pretty much in a rebuilding mode with the girls, but the boys are really strong this year with a number nationally recognised. Beth was also named in the Central under-21 team and we have some very good players. Neither team will be lightweights at the nationals," Dixon said.</p>
<p>Eight Central players have been named in the wider men and women's squads for the 2016 Junior World Cup.</p>
<p>Next year, Junior World Cup squads will be confirmed from which teams will be selected to compete at the Men's Junior World Cup in New Delhi on December 1-11 and Women's Junior World Cup in Chile on November 23-December 2.</p>
<p>Travelling to the nationals in North Harbour to compete between July 5-11 is an expensive exercise with each player having to front up with $1000 and another $300 each toward the team's required $5000.</p>
<p>All six players are seeking sponsorship and for that donation business houses or individuals can have their names appear on the warm-up gear of both teams gaining nationwide exposure.</p>
