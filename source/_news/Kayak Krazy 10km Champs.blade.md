<p><strong>Well done to our WHS students who finished strong at the National 10km Series for Kayaking which was held in Rotorua on Saturday 27 August.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Foster - 1st overall U14 women 5km.</strong><br /><strong>Jack Clifton - 2nd overall U16 mens 5km.</strong><br /><strong>Liam Lace - 1st overall U16 mens 5km.</strong><br /><strong>Cambell Tanner - 3rd overall U18 mens 10km.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Great results!</strong></p>
<p>47 paddlers took to the water on Lake Okareka, Rotorua, for the final race of the Kayak Krazy 10km Series on Saturday 27 August. &nbsp; There was a sharp blustery wind cutting through the lake so the course was changed to keep paddlers in as close to the sheltered shore as possible. &nbsp;The odd squall made things a bit unpleasant but thankfully these weren't too persistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 10km paddlers started first followed by the 5km younger paddlers a minute later.&nbsp;</p>
