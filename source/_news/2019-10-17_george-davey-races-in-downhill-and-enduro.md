WHS Year 9 student George Davey is a passionate mountain biker who races in Downhill and Enduro. 

His best results are 2 times overall winner for the U15 Wellington Enduro series, 5th place in U15 Enduro North Island school champs and 5th place in U15 at NZ Downhill round 1 in Rotorua last year.

George has never raced in the South Island before and he couldn't wait to represent WHS down in Dunedin.

**On Friday 4 October George raced the Enduro at the School Mountain Bike Champs in Dunedin where he placed 4th out of 67 in U15 and was 1 second off 3rd place.**

On Saturday he raced the Downhill. The conditions were wet and windy and George placed 17th out of 58 in U15.

Outstanding results George! 💛🚴‍♂️💚
