I first starting paddling for Te Ringa Miti Tai Heke Whanganui Waka Ama Club when I was at Intermediate and am still paddling/steering today. Itâ€™s definitely a whanau/family sport as my dad, brother, sister and I all paddled at the NZ Sprint Nationals a couple of weeks ago at Lake Karapiro, Cambridge. 

The event is huge and is one of the largest growing water sporting events in New Zealand with over 3500 paddlers competing over the seven days from Midgets (5+) to 70+ year olds.  One day is also set aside for 1-man/single racing which also is quite popular.  Teams will compete across all ages in singles, 6-man and 12-man racing which is always exciting to do and watch.

Our club is based at Putiki. This year we travelled away with five senior teams with some making semi-finals and finals. Every two years there is also the opportunity to qualify at nationals to compete at the World Sprints which is held all over the world, but due to covid that is currently on hold.
