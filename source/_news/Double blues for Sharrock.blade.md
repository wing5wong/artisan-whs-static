<p>DOUBLE BLUE: Whanganui rep cricket team wicketkeeper (and former WHS student) Chris Sharrock was honoured for two codes at the Massey University Sporting Blues Awards on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Whanganui sportsman Chris Sharrock had a night to remember at the Massey University Sporting Blues Awards on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sharrock achieved a rare feat being awarded the "blues" in two sporting codes - badminton and cricket.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Universities Blues Award is the highest sporting accolade given in the New Zealand tertiary system. It is part of a tradition dating from 1922 in New Zealand and earlier in England, where the colours of Oxford and Cambridge Universities came to be a symbol for sporting excellence.</p>
<p>Oxford "blues" were only awarded for what was then regarded as "real" sports, such as rowing, rugby and cricket. Athletes in other codes could only aspire to "half blues". One Irish University purportedly awards top athletes "pinks".</p>
<p>"Obviously things have changed over the years and sports like badminton are now included, thankfully," Sharrock said yesterday.</p>
<p>His badminton "blues' was awarded for his win in the men's and mixed doubles at the Taranaki Open, a win in the mixed doubles at the Manawatu Open and runner-up in the men's double at the same competition.</p>
<p>In April this year Sharrock was ranked No5 in New Zealand men's and mixed doubles.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Active Physio Wanganui representative cricket team wicketkeeper, the qualifying period for the Massey awards runs from October to October.</p>
<p>Wanganui had far from a glittering season, but Sharrock was able to count his unbeaten century against Horowhenua last year.</p>
<p>'Thankfully that counted. An unbeaten century wasn't bad for a wicketkeeper coming in at No 9. I'm pretty chuffed to have received two awards on the night. It's pretty rare and I was the only one on the night to be awarded two," Sharrock said.</p>
<p>He is in his final semester of his Sport and Exercise degree at Massey University majoring in coaching and sport management.</p>
