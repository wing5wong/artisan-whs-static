Last week our Year 12 Health class ran a Wellness Week which involved fun activities to help promote positive mental health.  Each day they organised different events at first break including; yoga, volleyball, learning to juggle, basketball, jump jam/dance session etc.  All students involved received a recognition and went into a draw to win canteen vouchers.

On Friday they cooked up a sausage sizzle for all participants during the week.  

The level 2 Health class wants to thank all the students who got involved.  It was great to see so many doing activities to promote positive mental health and wellbeing!  

Congratulations to MOAHU winning the form class quiz and AWAMA who were second - only 1 point separated the two!
