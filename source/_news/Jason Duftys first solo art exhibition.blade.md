<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Whanganui artist Jason Dufty says he was delighted when Bill Milbank invited him to exhibit his first solo show at his Bell St Gallery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've never done a series of works before," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My work is usually standalone pieces so I'm grateful to Bill for encouraging me to do this because I've really enjoyed it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Disappearing Shanghai</em>&nbsp;is based on Dufty's experiences of living in the Chinese city and exploring the ruins of the historic buildings as they are swallowed by the development of modern architecture.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I regularly went out exploring the changing city and took lots of photos.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was both fascinating and sad to see the way people were being moved from places where families had lived for generations."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Members of the tight-knit communities will receive modest government pay-outs and be dispersed into remote corners of Shanghai Dufty says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The people are resigned to it he says and use the expression "Mei banfa", meaning "Such is Life."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The works in the exhibitions are combinations of oil on canvas and Dufty has experimented with collage which he says is a new medium for him.</p>
<p>Of Ngati Hei iwi, Dufty was born and grew up in Auckland where he attained a Bachelor of Graphic Design from AUT.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After doing freelance graphic design work and travelling in Asia and Europe during the late 1990s, he established boutique design company Housewife and Raymon which he ran until 2007.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 2008, he completed a Post Graduate Diploma of Education and taught visual arts in Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My wife Kellie is from Whanganui and we moved back here with our two daughters in 2017."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dufty is teaching design and visual communication at Whanganui High School and shares a studio in the historic wool store on Heads Road with fellow artist and teacher Glen Hutchins and photographer Lewis Gardner.</p>
