<p><span>Woohoo!!!!! Our 1st XI Boys Cricket team won their T20 regional semi final game today at school against Horowhenua College. WHS went in to bat first and made 115 runs with Harry Lillington making his debut back in cricket and scoring 30 runs. Jess Watkin 4-4 off 4 overs, Tim Roebuck 2-4 off 4 overs, Joe Redpath 3-17 off 3 overs getting Horowhenua all out for 38. Some fine batting and bowling from WHS saw an easy win. They now go to Palmerston Nth next Thursday to play in the Regional T20 top 4 final. WHS play Hawera High first up at 11am and if win that they play winner out of Kuranui College and Feilding HS game in the grand final at 2.30pm. Well done team!!</span></p>
