The local branch of National Council of Women held an award ceremony for the Wynne Costly Literary Research Scholarship recently. This is the second year that this Scholarship has been offered to students. The research topic requirement was to write about a New Zealand woman or women who have or still are contributing in a distinctly definable way to society.

The assignment is intended to fit into NCEA subjects and curriculum currently taught in schools, with a Junior category for Years 8 – 10 and a Senior category for Years 11 – 13.

**In the Senior section, the winner was Abigail Sewell from Whanganui High School, second place went to Rochelle Lowe also from Whanganui High School.**

In the Junior section the winner was Pascale Bowie from Collegiate School.

The overall winner and recipient of the Wynne Costley Literary Research Scholarship Cup was Abigail Sewell. Her essay was on New Zealand Women in World War One and the opportunities for change this period of time provided women. She argued that while it did not create sudden equality, it can be considered a stepping stone for women’s rights.

Wynne Costley was a teacher at the former Wanganui Technical College and then for many years at Whanganui Girls College where she was Head of the English Department. She taught English, Latin and French. She had an avid interest in History and Social Justice, particularly in the development of student awareness of the impact of social changes in the world. She was a long-time member of National Council of Women.
