      The Best Delegation team were Russia. Benjamin White, Olivia Bardell and
      Eve Parker-Groves impressed not only with their grasp of the important
      issues, but also with the near life-sized replica of a Cold-War style
      weapon that was made especially to add authenticity for the competition.

Once again our WHS students have done well at the Junior Model United Nations day. This year 28 teams from the district debated resolutions around Climate Change and Nuclear Disarmament. It was fantastic to listen to our students discuss these important issues, they had prepared well and their ideas and responses showed an excellent level of preparation.

The day is always fun because not only are the students considering vitally important issues, and learning to listen and negotiate, but they also get an opportunity to dress up, share food and immerse themselves in the culture of their chosen country.

This year the WHS group representing Russia were voted Best Delegation. This requires that the whole team works collectively to speak authoritatively on the issues, and requires a lot of preparation The WHS group representing South Korea received the Merit Award in this category as well.

This year, in an unprecedented result, the Best Delegate award was split four ways, and two of our students received this award: Benjamin White (Russia), and Calum Sinclair (South Korea). This is the second year that Calum has won in this category.

In addition, the WJS team representing The Netherlands were voted Best Dressed Team, and our girls representing Egypt received the Merit award in this category.
Well done to everyone. This is a big time commitment, and our students did us proud.
