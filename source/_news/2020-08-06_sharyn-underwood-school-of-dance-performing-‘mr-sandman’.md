Sharyn has been putting on dance recitals at the Opera House since the mid-1980s with recitals every other year since 1995. Her recitals are great spectacles showcasing the talents of her students, giving them an opportunity to perform in a full theatrical venue.

Like all her shows, ‘Mr Sandman,’ which will be performed on Saturday/Sunday, August 1 and 2, is very much Sharyn’s own creation. You might have heard of the song ‘Mr Sandman, Bring me a Dream’ made famous by the Chordettes in 1954. Mr Sandman is a folklore figure created by Hans Christian Anderson. He is the magical character who supposedly brings dreams to all by sprinkling sand across their eyes as they travel from wakefulness to sleep.

As such, it is a great source for a show celebrating the influence of dreams; for in our dreams we can go anywhere, we can be anybody and we can do anything. As Sharyn says, “Come with us to follow our dreamers as they drift in and out of their world of sub consciousness.”

The show covers jazz, contemporary, musical theatre, lyrical and hip hop forms of dances with a mixture of sound tracks, which should appeal to a wide variety of people.

Sharyn has been supported by four other ex and current students to put the show together. They are:  

• Joana Simmons, an ex-pupil who is a professional dancer and choreographer in Melbourne. She was to be a participant but because of COVID-19 is unable to do so.  

• Nikita McDonald, another ex-pupil, who is currently at the Ettingshausens School of Performing Arts in Sydney. She returned to Whanganui pre-lockdown and is now waiting to return. She will be performing.  

**• Abby Squire and Emma Henare, both current students, have also contributed significantly with the with the choreography.**

The show was originally planned for the beginning of April and it has been quite stressful for Sharyn and the participants to get it back and running. Sharyn says, “It has been a challenge but an enjoyable one.” Organising such a show is a massive exercise.

The shows are both from 5pm to 7pm. There will be about 150 dancers involved. It will be a fun-filled show suitable for all to enjoy with some excellent dancing.

There is also a junior showcase show at 2pm on the Sunday aimed at pre-schoolers and younger students. It will be for 45 minutes and entrance is with a gold coin donation.
