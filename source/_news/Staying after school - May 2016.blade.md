<p>Wanganui High School long serving school board member Murray Woodhouse.</p>
<p>Getting an enthusiastic greeting from school children and their families is one of the reasons Marton Junction School board member Tony Hancock continues to serve the school although his youngest child is now 19.</p>
<p>He has served four three-year terms on the board and says all the current members have been there for at least six years which is great for continuity but some are ready to move on and he thinks there are four or five new people willing to stand.</p>
<p>He thought about resigning a few years ago but stayed on to support new principal Vanessa Te Ua when she started in 2012.</p>
<p>An Air Force engineer with a 5ha property that he likes to "potter about" on, Tony says he does not begrudge the time he spends supporting the school.</p>
<p>"I still really enjoy being part of the school and get a kick out of seeing kids achieving," he says.</p>
<p>Tony reckons any parent has something to offer a school board as long as they are there for the right reasons.</p>
<p>"As long as they have the best interests of the school and all the children at heart, they will be an asset.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you hear people saying things like 'I don't like that teacher so I'll join the board and get rid of them' sort of thing.</p>
<p>"That is not a reason to join and a person like that would not be any use on a board."</p>
