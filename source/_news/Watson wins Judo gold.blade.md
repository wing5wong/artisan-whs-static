<p><strong>Wanganui Judo Club exponent Kasey Watson picked up one the biggest victories of his career with gold at the Auckland International Judo Championships at the weekend.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Watson won the Cadet Men's Under 73kg competition, his effort the result of hard work with two training sessions every day - early morning and then the afternoon.</strong></p>
<p>"This is a big tournament - 11 countries competing, close to 300 competitors," said father and coach Wayne Watson.</p>
<p>"It was all clean throws too - no mucking about."</p>
<p>Watson will get straight back into his training routine to prepare for the Sydney International tournament next week.</p>
