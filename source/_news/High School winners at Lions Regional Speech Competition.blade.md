<h4 class="text_exposed_root text_exposed">Year 12 students from Whanganui High School, Emelye Brown and Arafia Khan, were winners at the recent Lions&rsquo; Regional Speech Competition, which covers Whanganui, Taranaki and Manawatu.</h4>
<p>It was held at Wanganui Intermediate School and was supported by many Lions club memebers.</p>
<p>The first requirement was to give a prepared speech and follow that up with an impromptu one, having been given 1 minute to prepare and two minute<span class="text_exposed_show">s for the speech itself. Contestants were kept in separate rooms until it was their turn. The topic for the impromptu speech was &lsquo;what is your favourite pet and why&rsquo; and as long as you defined the topic, you interpret it in any way you wanted.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">For the prepared speech, Arafia spoke on &lsquo;The Power of You&rsquo; and covered the power of difference, the power of acceptance and the power of YOUth. Emelye spoke on &ldquo;The Loneliest Whale in the World&lsquo; &ndash; about orca whales in captivity and something she is passionate about.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Arafia came third and received a thick diary and pen while Emelie came first receiving a glass trophy, and a trip to the Lions International Youth Camp later this year in Rotorua, worth $600. Representatives will be there from around the world. Emelye will also represent the region at the Lions National Speech competition in Christchurch in August.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Emelye is considering a career in law and Arafia in either business or medicine.</span></p>
