<p>Congratulations Annika!!&nbsp;<br />Fantastic news about your bright rowing future in Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="_5mfr"><span class="_6qdm">üëè</span></span></p>
<p>(the following is part of a message sent to Mrs Su'a, Dean of the International Students at the time Annika was studying here last year)</p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p><br />Hello Mrs Su'a,</p>
<p>I wanted to thank you again for the great time I had at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p>Especially I wanted to tell you that with the help of the coaches and the training at Aramoho I got into the Hamburg-Team which probably allows me from next year on to start for Germany.</p>
</div>
<p><em>Regards Annika Salwiczek</em><br /><em>Former International Student</em><br /><em>Whanganui High School</em></p>
