Whanganui Athletic Football Club (WAFC) players have been red-carded, but this time it’s all for fun and the revenue is going straight back to the club.

Senior player and long-time club member, **Steve Burney** (WHS old boy), has created the club’s very own set of collectible trading cards, featuring current and past players of the club. The card’s predominant colour is red, in keeping with WAFC club colours.

The cards include the players’ name, shirt number, team name, position and attack and defense statistics. They should become a unique piece of club memorabilia, as well as providing an innovative fundraiser for the club.

Most of the 1st and 2nd team players are featured on the cards, plus some of the 3rd team, a handful of Cosmos players and some ‘classic’ players. There are now 45 player cards to collect and just over 250 cards currently in supply with stocks to be replenished.

The collection includes ‘classic’ cards to recognise past members who have shaped the club. As the project grows, the cards will feature women and juniors.

Steve views the cards as a catalyst for club camaraderie, “People get a chance to trade their mates and get to know the other players in the club – young and old.

Steve has funded the first print run of cards personally, but also with the generous support of H&A Print. The cards are on sale at the 
WAFC clubrooms at Wembley Park, for a $1. They are sold free of packaging but a sense of randomness is preserved with buyers receiving the next card off the pile.

WAFC has 16 junior teams with around 160 juniors registered for the upcoming season. Registrations are still open.

Steve is seeking parents or supporters to help capture the on-field action by photographing players for the card profiles. He has also generously offered to assist other clubs with their own trading cards.
