<p><span>WHS had a great experience this week with hosting and billeting 49 rugby players from a school in South Croydon, London named Whitgift School. They are on a NZ/Australia tour and came to WHS for two nights. Our rugby and netball families billeted the boys and our 1st XV and 2nd XV played games against Whitgift on Tuesday in pouring rain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whitgift won both games , but our boys enjoyed the experience playing against international teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you to our families that took the billets in for two nights and looked after them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to&nbsp;hosting them again in the near future.&nbsp;</span></p>
