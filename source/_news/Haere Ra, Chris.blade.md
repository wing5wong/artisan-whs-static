<p>SCHOOL SUPPORT:&nbsp;Jacqui McKenzie (left), Natalie Campbell, Diane Calman, Nola Todd, Ross Brown, Mikaya Teki, Jackie Hazelhurst and Jack Southee represented Whanganui High School at the funeral of popular doctor Chris Cresswell.<br />Connor Cresswell was Head Boy at Whanganui High School last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GREEN THEME: Chris Cresswell's favourite colour was worn by many who gathered to honour him on Saturday.</p>
<p>Words like peace, love and unity were uttered many times in English and te reo Maori at Pakaitore/Moutua Gardens in Whanganui on Saturday.</p>
<p>Around 1000 people gathered there to farewell Dr Chris Cresswell, who died while mountain biking at Matipo Park on December 31.</p>
<p>Dr Cresswell 49, was acting head of the emergency department at Whanganui Hospital as well as a loved husband, father, son, brother and friend to many in the community.</p>
<p>The gathering began with a powhiri followed by tributes and waiata from Whanganui Iwi members.</p>
<p>Iwi representative Ken Mair said Dr Cresswell's work in the community was exceptional.</p>
<p>"In his work as a doctor as well as his courage in standing up and advocating for causes like climate change, he was always humble and respectful."</p>
<p>The predominant colours at the gathering were green (Dr Cresswell's favourite colour and representative of his political affiliations as well as his love for the environment) and blue worn by his medical colleagues.</p>
<p>There were also bright butterflies and sunflowers representing the peaceful protests and action groups that were an important part of his life.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School head students Jackie Hazelhurst, Mikaya Teki and Jack Southee wore their school uniforms in support of Mr Cresswell's son Connor who was 2016 head boy at the school.</p>
<p>Connor paid tribute to his father with a reading of the Dylan Thomas poem&nbsp;<em>Do not go gentle into that Good Night</em>&nbsp;while his cousin Angus chose to be "upbeat" in his homage to his uncle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Looking round the people gathered here, I reckon it is safe to say the my uncle was a bloody weirdo and you should all be as quirky as you can to honour his memory," said Angus.</p>
<p>There was also celebration of Dr Cresswell's sense of humour with a rendition of the Monty Python classic&nbsp;<em>Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</em>&nbsp;led by kevin Ray.</p>
<p>Dr Cresswell's older sister Nicola Dickie, said that she, her brother, and their younger sister Pip got on well both as children and adults.</p>
<p>"I am glad that we did not waste any of the years we had with fighting," she said.</p>
<p>Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei had travelled from Dunedin to honour Dr Cresswell who was a member of the party and outspoken in his views on climate change and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>"He was deeply inspirational," said Ms Turei.</p>
<p>"I loved the way he always took life by the horns and enjoyed what he did."</p>
<p>As a member of Whanganui Peace Action group, Dr Cresswell travelled to Auckland to protest against the visit of an American nuclear warship and an arms conference last month.</p>
<p>"He was always respectful in the way he spoke to people in those situations," said fellow protester Denise Lockett.</p>
<p>"The police were arming themselves with long batons and Chris said 'please don't use those guys - they hurt people' and that was how he was, he always used reason."</p>
<p>Whanganui Mayor Hamish McDouall said he admired Dr Cresswell's ability to bring people together and encourage others.</p>
<p>"He touched us all with his love of life, his incredible charisma and strong principles," he said.</p>
<p>Coast Care co-ordinator Graham Pearson said he was always impressed with the time Dr Cresswell made to show his support for community projects.</p>
<p>"He was a doctor but he always tried to be an ambulance at the top of the cliff kind of guy," said Mr Pearson.</p>
<p>"He had to be at the bottom of the cliff too of course but he encouraged people to eat well, exercise and enjoy the environment as well."</p>
<p>The Order of Service included five eulogies delivered by family, friends and medical colleagues including former head of emergency department at Whanganui Hospital Dr Athol Steward.</p>
<p>Rihi Karena led the singing of waiata&nbsp;<em>Te Aroha</em>&nbsp;and Chris Harrex gave a reading of&nbsp;<em>Our Deepest Fear</em>&nbsp;by Marianne Williams.</p>
<p>Nicola Dickie said her brother loved Dr Suess' book on the perils of corporate greed&nbsp;<em>The Lorax</em>&nbsp;when he was a child.</p>
<p>"I think he really lived by the lessons of that story and became the Lorax," she said.</p>
<p>After the commital and commendation by celebrant Pam Erni, family and friends continued their celebration of Dr Cresswell's life at the Cosmopolitan Club in Ridgway St.</p>
