<p class="element element-paragraph">Organised by Sport Whanganui, interested parties can visit their website to submit an entry form in any of the 11 categories for players, administrators, coaches, teams and clubs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As this is the first year where all entries are to be submitted online, staff at the Sport Whanganui offices beside Cooks Gardens are available to help should anyone need assistance.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The deadline to submit a nomination is Friday, October 15, with the awards ceremony being held a month later at the Wanganui Function Centre.</p>
