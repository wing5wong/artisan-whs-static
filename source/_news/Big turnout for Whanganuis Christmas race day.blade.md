<p class="element element-paragraph">It was horses not reindeer at Whanganui racecourse on Saturday, but the festive spirit was still pumping.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual Christmas at the Races meeting - Whanganui's biggest race day of the year - proved more popular than ever, with almost 4000 people enjoying the event.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">In glorious sunshine, punters enjoyed a flutter, and families enjoyed the fun in a memorable meeting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The feature race, the Cambridge Thoroughbred Lodge Wanganui Cup, was taken out by All In Vogue, with Leah Hemi a class act in the saddle and owners Peter and Min McDonald enjoying another big win - this one worth $50,000.</p>
