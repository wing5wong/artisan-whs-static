<p>The ten Whanganui members of the Hurricanes Heartland Under 20 team celebrate their win over Hawkes Bay Under 19 in Napier on Saturday.</p>
<p><span>Former WHS students <strong>Dylan Bowater and Ethan Robinson</strong> get the points for team to beat Hawkes Bay Under 19.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were due success for all their efforts, and the Hurricanes Heartland Under 20's with their ten Whanganui players earned victory as they came from behind to beat the Hawkes Bay Under 19's 10-8 in Napier on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Expectations were high that the players collected from around the Hurricanes rural catchment could win their final Central Region Shield match, after they were competitive in losses to the Wellington and Manawatu Under 19 squads, who had beaten Hawkes Bay by wider margins.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It wasn't looking that way early as Hawkes Bay scored a try and kicked a penalty in the first and final minute of the first half to lead 8-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, Hurricanes Heartland came back with their Whanganui captain <strong>Dylan Bowater</strong> scoring a try while second-five <strong>Ethan Robinson</strong>, the Whanganui vice captain, converted it and added a penalty.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Darren Larsen said he was most impressed with the composure in the final ten minutes for the side to hang onto their slim lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Bloody good result, for getting the victory for the boys to experience the win together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The thought process was still around performance. But there was still a definite edge about knowing we could receive a result."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui players all did their part, with props Blade Jones and <strong>Shaquille McKay</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) playing the opening half while hooker Dylan Gallien came off the bench at halftime.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lock Hamish Bennett and flanker <strong>Chris Breuer </strong>(former WHS student) did the full match - Breuer switching to lock - as did winger Harry Symes, while halfback <strong>Cameron Davies&nbsp;</strong>(former WHS student) played 55 minutes and winger Shaquille Waara gave it everything until having to come off with bad leg cramp in the last ten minutes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the last three weeks, Larsen said he saw definite progression from the squad, who would meet up on the Friday before their games for a training run, which was based on doing the same calls and plays as the Hurricanes in Super Rugby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Each week we just wanted to be better."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Larsen said he has a triangle of performance - talent, worth ethic and character - with the team ticking every one in their win on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The season honours continue with 15 of the 25 squad members now going onto the New Zealand Heartland XV to contest the Mitre 10 Jock Hobbs Memorial Under 19 Tournament in Taupo, which starts on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's been the building block of what the [Central] competition's based on," said Larsen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Among them will be <strong>Bowater</strong>, Bennett, Gallien, <strong>Breuer</strong>, and Symes, as well as their Air Chathams Wanganui Under 20 teammate Gordon Coogan.</p>
