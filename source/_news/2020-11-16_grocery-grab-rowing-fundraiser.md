#### Rules and Conditions for Whanganui High School Rowing/Pak n Save Grab Prizes - 6 December 2020

2 x 1st prizes will be drawn.  
Both are 4-minute Grocery Grabs worth up to $500.00.  
The prizes will be drawn and winners notified on Thursday 3 December  
If a winner cannot be contacted within 48 hours, then a re-draw for that prize will occur.  

**Tickets** can be purchased from the rowers themselves or Lisa Murphy.

##### Rules and Conditions

1. The Grocery Grab will take place at Pak n Save Wanganui, 167 Glasgow St, Whanganui. The time of the event will start at 8am on Sunday, 6 December 2020. Both winners of the prizes must arrive half an hour prior to the start time for a briefing and welcome.
2. If a winner is unable to attend for any reason, they are permitted to appoint someone else to take their place, and they must notify Whanganui High School Rowing Committee Member Lisa Murphy (0276669884) of the change 24 hours prior to the event. Failure to do so may result in the forfeiture of the prize. Each participant must notify Pak n Save Wanganui of any special needs or requirements he/she has that may impact on the participant undertaking the Grocery Grab e.g. whether wheelchair access or a support person is required.
3. Winners will toss a coin to who goes first and second and must follow a pre-determined map/direction as set out by Pak n Save Wanganui management. Due to the supermarket being open for general customers at the same time, the map/directions must be followed to minimise disturbance to other shoppers.
4. Each participant will get 4 minutes to collect as many groceries as possible to the maximum value of $500. Only items in the trolley when the 4 minutes are up are included in the prize.
5. The participant may not select more than 1 item of the same product.
6. The Grocery Grab excludes all tobacco, alcohol, electronic goods, grocery vouchers, phone cards, lotto products, DVD’s, cosmetics valued at over $50, pharmacy items and gift cards.
7. The total of the trolley of groceries will be calculated at a designated check out on completion of the 4 minutes. If the value is more than $500, the participant can choose which items they will remove to get the total down to the $500 prize value OR pay the difference in the actual value of the goods and the $500 prize value. Should the trolley value be less than $500, this will be the total of the participant’s Grocery Grab. If there is a short fall, this cannot be claimed in goods or cash at all.
8. By entering this competition, you agree to the following:
