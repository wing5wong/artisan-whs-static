<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School student Rose Hird is the winner of the youth award in the 2019 Whanganui Arts Review for her self-portrait&nbsp;<em>Rōhi</em>.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 15-year-old's work was selected for the WDC Youth Committee Youth Recognition Award by judge Andrew Clifford, of Te Uru Waitakere Contemporary Gallery in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I based it on Rita Angus' painting&nbsp;<em>Rutu</em>," says Hird.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I thought about the symbols and techniques she used and how I could create my own self-portrait."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Angus' 1951 work was painted with oils while Rose has used acrylics and added her own symbolism.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She has depicted herself wearing the scarf that symbolises her Scouts New Zealand membership and while the Angus painting depicted a white lotus flower, Hird's one features a red rose.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Obviously it's my name and I like the flower as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The name Rose is Rōhi in te reo Māori and the rose in Hird's painting sit behind her head like a halo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She has also included a scotch thistle in the foreground which she says symbolises her Scottish heritage and is a nod to her grandmother, who came from Aberdeen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hird was one of a record number of young artists to submit her work to the open age art competition this year.</p>
