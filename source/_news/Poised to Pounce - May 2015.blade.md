<p>POISED TO POUNCE: Rebecca Baker (green, left), Wanganui High School runner, stalks the early leaders before clearing out to win the Year 9 Girls' event in Waiouru last week.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Regional Secondary Schools Cross Country last Thursday took place with military precision.</p>
<p>Hosted by the Waiouru military camp, eight secondary schools relished the exciting and challenging courses set by trainers at the army camp. The 116 students who participated seemed to really enjoy the experience, even in the chilly mountain weather.</p>
<p>The schools gave a huge "thank you" to Ruapehu College and to the army camp for hosting such an awesome event.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wanganui High School's&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Rebecca</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Baker</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;ran a great race at the Waiouru camp to easily win the Year 9 girls' race.&nbsp;</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Baker</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;also won the WHS Year 9 cross country the week before which was held at Bason Reserve. The Year 9 boys' event featured Travis Bayler coming third for WHS, with schoolmate Sam Luff right behind in fourth place.</span></p>
<p>In the senior girls' race, Emma Rainey was third and Ryan Gray finished fifth in the senior boys' event. WHS is looking forward to seeing these students excel in the sport.</p>
