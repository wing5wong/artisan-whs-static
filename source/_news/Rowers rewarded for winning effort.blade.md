<p class="element element-paragraph">Four promising young rowers who tested their mettle against current world and Olympic champions on the Whanganui River on Sunday have received $100 cash prizes from the Whanganui Mitre 10 MEGA Future Champions Trust.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Racing in the Billy Webb Challenge against the likes of Mahe Drysdale, John Storey and Chris Harris, the four youth rowers were the winners of their C-class age groups.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>WHS student Levi Carroll (Men's U20) finished the 5.7km race in 24m 17s</strong>, while Jamie Harris (Women's U20) completed it in 27m 15s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Of the Under 17 rowers, Blake Hogan (Men's) crossed the line in 25m 11s, and Siena McLean (Women's) was done in 29m 44s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Trustee and naming sponsor Hayden Gibson said the trust was proud to support high achieving youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We see the Billy Webb event with double Olympic champion Mahe Drysdale involved as a really inspiring opportunity to promote the goals of the trust and support some upcoming young rowers."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next funding round for the trust closes on March 31.</p>
