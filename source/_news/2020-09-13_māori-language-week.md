Tihei mauri ora!  
Tuia te rangi e tū nei  
Tuia te papa e hora nei  
Tuia te here tāngata  
Ka rongo te pō  
Ka rongo te ao  
Tihei mauri tu ki runga!

Behold the breath of life!   
Let the heavens above  
and the earth beneath  
and all mankind be as one  
throughout the long night  
and into the dawn of the next day.  
May the same breath lift our waning spirit!  
<sup> (Morvin Simon, 1984)


Tēnā koutou katoa,  

This week is Te Wiki o te Reo Māori/Māori Language Week and here at Whanganui High School we will be supporting this kaupapa with a range of different activities for Tauira and Kaiako.  

First break Monday-Thursday in Te Wehi gym we will be running ngā taonga tākaro/traditional Māori games, like poi toa, rakaunui and many more, for anyone who would like to take part.  

Every morning this week there will be a pātai in the notices with prizes up for grabs. All you need to do is write your answer and name on a piece of paper and drop it into the drop-box in the Student Centre.  

There will be spot prizes given out for those speaking Te Reo Māori around Kura.  

“Kia Kaha te Reo Māori”
