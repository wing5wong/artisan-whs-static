<p><strong>Charlotte Taylor placed 3rd, Olivia Caird placed 1st, receiving the overall&nbsp;winning school award from Phil Healy director of Kai Catering at UCOL.</strong></p>
<p>Secondary school students had a cracking good time in the Whanganui UCOL kitchen on Friday while competing in the annual omelette competition.</p>
<p>Twelve students from Whanganui City College, Whanganui High School, Whanganui Girls' College, Te Kura o Kokohuia and UCOL U-Skills competed.</p>
<p>They had 20 minutes to prepare, cook and serve two identical cheese omelettes using two or three eggs and at least one type of cheese as well as a choice of fillings.</p>
<p>The omelettes were judged by UCOL chef lecturer Damian Peeti, cookery diploma student Katisha Miller and Stellar chef Phil Healy.</p>
<p>Dishes and chefs were judged on originality, organisation, cleanliness and presentation.</p>
<p><strong>First place went to Whanganui High School student Olivia Caird for her sweet omelette containing raspberries, ricotta cheese, lemon curd and French sorrel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Olivia and her team-mate, Charlotte Taylor, secured first place for WHS overall</strong>, and Sarah Macnab and Katie Pull from Whanganui Girls' College came second equal, while Whanganui City College's Arapeta Latus gained third place.</p>
<p>Mr Peeti said the teams competed well and there was good camaraderie in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"I think it would be great to look at combining the school teams and sending a Whanganui team to the national competition next year," he said.</p>
<p>Katie Pull and Sarah Macnab were last year's winners for WGC and went on to bring home gold and silver medals from the Taranaki/Wanganui Hospitality Competitions at the Western Institute of Technology in New Plymouth.</p>
