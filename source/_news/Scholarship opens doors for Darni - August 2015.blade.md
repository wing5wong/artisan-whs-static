<p>PASSION: Former WHS student Architect Darni Struijck completed her thesis with help from Kelly and Associates.</p>
<p>Applications are now open for 2015 AMP Scholarships and, because there are no age limits, almost anyone is eligible.</p>
<p>Wanganui architecture student Darni Struijck received the $5000 Kelly and Associates regional scholarship last year and put it towards the cost of completing her thesis at Victoria University.</p>
<p>"The scholarship came at the perfect time for me, because I was studying part-time and working for a Wanganui architect and I needed to put more time into completing my thesis," she said.</p>
<p>Darni's thesis was on accessible architecture, a passion she developed while growing up with a disabled brother and noticing the limitations he faced.</p>
<p>"My parents liked to travel and they took us to visit interesting buildings around New Zealand, so my interest in architecture was fostered along with my awareness of a lack of accessibility in many places.</p>
<p>"We visited a lighthouse in Gisborne once and my mother and I decided to carry my brother up to the top, but we only made it halfway and we almost fainted with the effort."</p>
<p>Darni has now completed her degree and works for Wellington architecture company Jasmax, where she is learning about commercial architecture.</p>
<p>"I'm on a steep learning curve here and I am really enjoying the work.</p>
<p>"I don't get the opportunity to incorporate my ideas for accessibility at this stage but I am building my portfolio."</p>
<p>Kelly and Associates, a family-owned insurance advice business serving Wanganui, Rangitikei and surrounding districts, are not able to offer the regional scholarship this year but Wanganui candidates are eligible to apply for national scholarships.</p>
<p>AMP chief executive Jeff Ruscoe said: "AMP has one of the largest scholarship funds of its kind and over the last 17 years has provided over $2 million to help more than 160 Kiwis achieve and do their thing. From golfers to fashion and shoe designers, dancers, scientists, dog sledders, canoeists, BMX world champions, cancer rehabilitators and underwater cameramen - the list really does go on and demonstrates the diverse range of people the AMP Scholarships help."</p>
<p>"With up to $200,000 available this year through the AMP Scholarship programme, there's nothing stopping you from applying." Applications are open until September 28 and can be made by visiting doyourthing.co.nz.</p>
