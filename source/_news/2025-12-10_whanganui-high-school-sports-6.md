This year saw a record 269 schools participate with WHS success putting them up with the power school's in the country in terms of their performances. A major focus of the programme is relays which bring in a team component and challenge the depth of the schools squad.

Whanganui High school fielded 21 athletes across the grades who came home with 36 Personal bests, including school records and one NZSS best.

Attention now turns to the 2026 NZ Secondary school Champs to be held on home soil in Whanganui, where the school is looking to field its biggest ever team and achieve more success.

Well done to the team and our amazing coaching staff - Greg Fromont and Elaine Baker. 💚💛
