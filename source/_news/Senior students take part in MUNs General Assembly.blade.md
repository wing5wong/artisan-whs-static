<p><span>INDIA'S DELEGATES: Whanganui High School students Ben Power, Nanea Schurhammer and Ali Gammeter make India's case at the Model UN General Assembly.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Global warming, nuclear disarmament and the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar were the focus for students attending the Model United Nations General Assembly in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Twenty-eight senior students from Whanganui Girls' College, Whanganui High School, Wanganui Collegiate and Nga Tawa took part in the debate about world issues on Friday at Whanganui Girls' College.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event was organised by the Wanganui branch of the United Nations Association of New Zealand. President Kate Smith said the senior group was much smaller this year because many students who participated in previous years had now left secondary school and interested junior students had not yet moved up to the senior classes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>The students, in teams of two or three, represented UN members Germany, Vietnam, Greece, Thailand, Haiti, Seychelles, India, Norway, Japan and Malaysia. They had researched the country they represented and its position on the issues and dressed in costumes reflecting that country's culture.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>The Model UN sessions reflect the formality of a real UN conference, with delegates required to address others with respect at all times and having the opportunity to lobby other nations to support their position on an issue.</span></p>
