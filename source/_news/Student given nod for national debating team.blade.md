<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Alister Hughes, 17, is the only member of the five-strong team who is not from Auckland or Wellington.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alister is a non-travelling reserve, meaning that he will only travel to Bali for the world competition if one of the other team members is unable to take part.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was chosen after competing for Whanganui High School in the central North Island competition, where he was chosen as best speaker and selected for the central North Island team. He then competed in the national Russell McVeagh Schools Debating competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Year 13 student has been involved in debating for the past five years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I started debating because I'm interested in ideas. I wanted to go beyond what we learn at school."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alister said the news that he was in the national team was "unbelieveable".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wasn't expecting it at all."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But Stuart Miller, one of Whanganui High School's debating coaches, said he was not surprised at Alister's selection.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's an excellent debater," Mr Miller said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said the school had gone through a purple patch with debating for the past decade, with a number of students called up for the national team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Successes like these encourage other students to become involved in debating," Mr Miller said.</p>
