<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>With the general election just two weeks away, reporter Anne-Marie Mcdonald speaks with some of Whanganui's youngest and oldest voters.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Caius Wrigglesworth, 19, Penny Lilburn, 18, McKenzie Tunua, 18, and Jack Southee, 18, will be voting for the first time at this election. Caius is a draughtsman, while Penny goes to Wanganui Collegiate, and <strong>Jack and McKenzie are students at Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All four have enrolled to vote, and they intend to vote - but they haven't yet decided who to vote for.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So, as young people preparing to vote for the first time, what's important to them this election?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The environment and conservation stand out as major issues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I know there are a lot of other important issues like the economy and housing," Caius says. "But for me, at least, I feel like we're not paying much attention to conservation. We still have that idea in our heads that New Zealand is such a green country; but in reality, we're letting it go."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">McKenzie agrees that conversation and environment are important, but likes aspects of both major parties' policies in this area.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack is also concerned about the environment. He's also interested in policies that have long-term benefits rather than short-term gain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm talking about things like climate change, and actually implementing things that will address that; also incarceration and rehabilitating people back into society. Obviously our current prison system isn't working because people are still committing crimes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's been a lot of talk in this election about Labour raising taxes. But I think with a lot of the big issues, like roading, housing, the environment, there is an expectation that government will pay for these things because we all reap the benefits of them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Home for Penny is a farm near Hunterville, so she is concerned about Labour's proposed tax on the use of water for commercial purposes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For people who use irrigation it could cost up to half of their annual income. I think Labour do have some good policies around the environment and conservation, but because of the water tax policy I couldn't see myself voting for Labour."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All four agree that voting is important.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whether you vote or not, everyone is affected by what the government does," Caius says. "So you might as well vote."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm only 18 now, but by the time the next election comes around I'll be 21, and that's when government policies will really start to affect me," Penny says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think older generations vote for what benefits them in the short-term," McKenzie says. "But people of our generation will be living with decisions made by the government for much longer."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><img src=http://c1940652.r52.cf0.rackcdn.com/59b59fe7b8d39a35a5000b08/VotingJack-Southee-only.jpg alt="" /></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack says while voting is important, many young people think their vote doesn't count.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's easy to think that you're just one vote, and that's really insignificant and won't change a thing. But the way I see it is that you can't complain about what the government is doing unless you vote."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But they admit a lot of their friends have no interest in politics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In my group of friends, there's two others who are interested," Penny says. "The rest are enrolled, but they're not interested, and they won't vote."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Caius thinks a lot of young people are apathetic because of the medium through which politics is presented.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People of my age aren't going to watch the debates on television, or listen to the radio. They might see something on Facebook, but they're not going to click on the link to read it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All four believe more needs to be done through schools to teach young people about politics and voting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've really learned nothing at school," McKenzie says. "Everything I know about politics has come through my own research, or talking to people."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack believes politics should be a compulsory subject at school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Schools do implement compulsory subjects, so it could it done. I think it's what needs to happen. If it was an optional subject, only those who are already interested will take it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All four are enthusiastic about Labour's plan to introduce civics and driver's licence classes in school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really think this all needs to start at school. We need to look at how we are educating the next generation," Jack says.</p>
