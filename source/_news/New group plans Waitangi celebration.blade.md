<p>New group Whakawhanake Ltd is organising an event for Whanganui for Waitangi Day this year, former WHS student Kiri Wilson says.</p>
<p>It will be from noon to 5pm at Pakaitore/Moutoa Gardens and include music, food stalls and activities for children.</p>
<p>The group is Miss Wilson, Tamahaia Skinner, Daniel Solomon, Hawea Meihana and Rongomaitawhiri Ah Ching.</p>
<p>"Whakawhanake is a kaupapa that enables us to participate and contribute into meaningful spaces that affect our people," Whakawhanake's statement on Facebook says.</p>
<p>This is the first event the group has held, and it stepped in to fill a need. It received no funding, but members can draw on resources and contacts from their other activities.</p>
<p>"This is a time when we can all come together and do something really good for our community without worrying about who's paying," Miss Wison said.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to have a fundraising food stall or to sing or perform on February 6 can contact her on 027-369- 4840.</p>
