<p><span>The Whanganui hockey girls wait to embark on their journey to the U15 National Championships in Timaru where they are subsequently unbeaten after four pool games.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui boys went on a goal-scoring spree at their National U15 Hockey Championship in Invercargill yesterday blasting West Coast 10-nil to secure a quarter final spot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Feeling a tad disappointed with a nil-all draw with Canterbury on Wednesday, coach Andrew Spence said his team were hungry of victory against the Coasters.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They really wanted it today," Spence said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"After the nil-all draw on Wednesday they were a little disappointed. They felt they were a little bit better than Canterbury, but just couldn't put the ball away - they certainly didn't have any problem today."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The win puts Whanganui into the quarter finals and they will now play North Harbour today, a side Spence expects to be competitive.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"North Harbour will be competitive, but I believe if we play anything like we did today, we&nbsp;can beat them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui under-15 boys have been runners-up of several occasions at this tournament and last year finished fourth - a winning turn this year would not surprise coach Spence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the Whanganui girls continued on their unbeaten way at the U15 Championships in Timaru beating Thames Valley 4-0 to find a place in the quarter finals after finishing top of Pool A.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their game on Thursday, possibly against Auckland, is a late affair kicking off at 5.15pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In four games Whanganui girls have only had two goals scored against them, while slotting 17 themselves. That speaks volumes for not only their attacking skills, but their defence as well.</p>
