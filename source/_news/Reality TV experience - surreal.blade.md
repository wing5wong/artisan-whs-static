<p>At one point during Jack Judd-Nuttall's brief reality TV career 28,000 people were searching for his name on Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>The former Whanganui man said being a reality TV star was a surreal experience, but one of the best of his life. He hasn't been tempted to repeat it yet - despite offers.</p>
<p>In New Zealand he first appeared on TV2 last week, in the dating show&nbsp;<em>Meet the Parents</em>. In it young singles get to choose between potential partners by asking their parents questions.</p>
<p>Answers to those questions can be embarrassing for the potential partners. As a potential suitor Mr Judd-Nuttall couldn't see the reactions of the women - but the audience could.</p>
<p>Young Jack was brought up in Whanganui, played sport and went to Whanganui High School. At university in Palmerston North he got a degree in sport and exercise, then returned to Whanganui to teach physical and outdoor education at Whanganui High School for about five months.</p>
<p>After that he winged away to London, where he worked first as a primary school head of physical education and then as a classroom teacher.</p>
<p>He got involved with reality TV by chance. A housemate saw a Facebook post asking for outgoing single people to appear in a show. She tagged Mr Judd-Nuttall.</p>
<p>"Within the day I had a call from one of the ITV recruiters and the interviews and videos etc went from there," he said.</p>
<p>He thought being on a dating show might be risky for a teacher, but decided to try it "for a laugh".&nbsp;</p>
<p>He didn't realise how big the show was going to be. It was aired on national prime time TV and hosted by celebrity Holly Willoughby.</p>
<p>He was treated like a celebrity himdelf for a couple of days. He had to lock down all social media and then leave it to someone else to monitor until the show appeared.</p>
<p>There was a big viewing party in London before that, "with what seemed half of Wanganui watching with us," he said.</p>
<p>He wasn't paid for his appearance by ITV, but said he receieved loads of free clothes, hotels and transport. The experience was mainly sold to him "as a gateway to more TV".</p>
<p>The woman he eventually chose to date did cash in by selling stories to newspapers and radio - including information that "wasn't supposed to be released".</p>
<p>Mr Judd-Nuttall found himself on screen again in&nbsp;<em>Gogglebox</em>, a show about people watching other shows, in his case&nbsp;<em>Meet the Parents</em>.</p>
<p>He's had a couple of offers to do more television work, but nothing has tempted him so far.</p>
