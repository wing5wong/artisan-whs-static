<p><span><br />On Wednesday evening, WHS took a team of five Year 9 students to the Manawatu Readers Cup held at the Feilding Civic Centre.</span></p>
<p>It was an evening of quiz questions on six novels, which had the WHS team of Georgia Hiscotte, Hazel Chant, Cara Bensemann, Sophia Bedwell and Mira Meijer battling with fifteen other schools for the Manawatu Readers Cup. After the competition for the first three books, two team members left early for the Performing Arts evening, so the remaining three had to contest the last three books without a full contingent. They made a remarkable effort to increase their lead and to tie for first place<strong> </strong>with Wairarapa College at the end of the competition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result the contest became a tiebreaker with Wairarapa College. Despite a hard-fought finish, the tiebreaker went against the WHS team who were runners-up on the night. Prizes were a selection of popular books. These were also given out for the team&rsquo;s win for the Best Mascot and special mention for the team name: &ldquo;Metaphors be with us&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all team members!</p>
