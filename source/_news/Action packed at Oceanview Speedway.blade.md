<p class="element element-paragraph">A sunny, windy afternoon made for difficult conditions at Fast Lane Spares Oceanview Family Speedway on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But once the final chequered flag was shown, everyone could reflect on another excellent speedway meeting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sidecars made only their second appearance of the season for the Karl Barritt Memorial, with a quality field of six bikes entered.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former 1NZ Russell Stuart and Andrew Parker started as favourites, but a brush with the wall that almost dislodged Parker in heat one ruined their chances.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That race, and the second heat were won by the 2018 winners Mark Whye and Jacob Cooper (96P)</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whye/Cooper combination took a handy lead into heat three, and although beaten by Stuart and Parker, they took the trophy with 17 points out of a possible 18.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Glen Murray and Ann Plummer (21P) were rewarded for their consistency with second place, and Stuart and Parker finished third overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Trev's Concrete Stockcar Shootout produced some entertaining racing right from the first heat when Damon Baxter (7V) and Taylor Lampp (992W) had a lengthy cat and mouse battle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">West Coast champion <strong>Callum Sturzaker</strong> (15V) eliminated Lampp in the next race, and lasted for five rounds until mechanical problems brought his challenge to a halt.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Newcomer to the class Mizaan Lees (58V) entered the fray with two rounds remaining, and made an immediate impact beating Nathan Black (67V), then taking out the final against 61V Dion Black.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Lees' tactical nouse will not have gone unnoticed, and he has made an impressive start to his stockcar career.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To end the evening, Baxter took his maiden win in his new car in the Elite Mechanical Stockcar feature race.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">An excellent field of 17 Superstocks turned on some fast and noisy action for the crowd.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Foxton driver Zane Dykstra (38P) took out the opening heat, then Dion Mooney took his first chequered flag in his new car in the second heat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Darrel Wallace (557P) took out the feature race, ahead of 53V Shaun Smith.</p>
