#### Karate catch up  
On Easter weekend a few WHS students representing Wanganui Kyokushin MOKNZ competed at the 2021 Match Fights in Napier.  

**Oscar and Emily Benson** both won their match fights performing very well with confidence and good technique.
  
**Jake Hood** fought the two big boys from Auckland both 40kg heavier than Jake and his first time competing against men. He narrowly lost his first fight, and I had him scoring a knockdown in his second fight but the referee didnâ€™t award it, and lost by decision.

#### Judo  
A few WHS students representing the Wanganui Judo Club competed in the Wellington Area Open Championships at Kapiti College, 17-18 April.

* **Jayden Ivory won Bronze**, Senior Boys U60kg.

* **Jake Hood won Bronze**, Junior Men U90kg, after five tough fights. He only had 3 weeks training, a month after his Karate bouts at the National Match Fight Karate Championships in Napier.

* **Callaghan Watson won Gold**, Cadet Men +81kg Division and stepped up to fight Junior Mens where the competition was a lot harder against stronger and experienced fighters.  
**Callaghan also won Gold**, Junior Men U100kg.


Former students also excelled, including the one and only;
  
* **Keightley Watson**..  
Gold - Senior Men +100kg

Gold - Junior Men OPEN

* & **Finn Brown**..
