<p>A Wanganui hair salon is celebrating after winning one of New Zealand's most prestigious industry awards.</p>
<p>Protege Hairdressing won the New Zealand Salon of the Year Supreme Award at the Kitomba/New Zealand Association of Registered Hairdressers Business Awards in Wellington at the weekend.</p>
<p>Protege also took out a clutch of other awards including Employer of Choice, Excellence in Marketing, and Boutique Salon of the Year. The salon was the runner-up in two other award categories.</p>
<p>For co-owners Tiffiny Spencer and Kate Watson, winning the Supreme Award was the realisation of a dream they have held for six years.</p>
<p>The pair, who trained together in Wanganui, opened Protege nearly six years ago and their goal was to one day win the New Zealand Salon of the Year award.</p>
<p>Last year, was the first time they entered the awards and they won the Best Newcomer award. To go straight from that to best salon was "pretty amazing".</p>
<p>"We're very excited," Tiffiny said.</p>
<p>Just entering the awards took four solid months of preparation. Salons are judged, not on their styling ability, but on business practices.</p>
<p>"It looked at systems and procedures, policies, communication, feedback from staff and from clients. It's very black and white - that's what we loved about the awards. You're either doing things right, or you're not," Tiffiny said.</p>
<p>Four judges from the industry assessed each entry. This year's judges were Charmaine Guest, Kristal Sargent, Kayla Juhasz and Belinda Robb.</p>
<p>In their report, the judges said Protege demonstrated "outstanding success" across all areas of the business.</p>
<p>"This is a highly productive salon that has strong leadership, sound business practices and, most importantly of all, soul. It was a pleasure judging this entry."</p>
<p>Tiffiny and Kate said their success comes down to one thing: hard work.</p>
<p>"We love what we do. We love hairdressing, and we really love our team. We are like a family and we look after each other," Kate said.</p>
<p>The salon employs a close-knit team of six, five of whom have been trained by Tiffiny and Kate.</p>
<p>So, where to next for Protege, now that they've achieved their big goal?</p>
<p>"Extending ourselves professionally and growth within our team is always a goal for us," Tiffiny said.</p>
<p>"That's going to be true for us whether we are winning awards or not."</p>
<p>Kate and Tiffiny said they plan to throw a celebratory party.</p>
