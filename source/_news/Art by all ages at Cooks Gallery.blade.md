<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Variety sums up the work on offer at Cooks Gallery over the two weekends of Artists Open Studios.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The efforts of a large group of society members is on panels, walls and easels and reflects a vast amount of talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a departure from past exhibitions, each artist has been allocated a bay in which they can show their work and paint if they wish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're all enjoying the participation. It's just great, there's so much of it," says society publicity officer Judy Webby. "It's more personalised, because people can ask questions while the artist is working."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">About a dozen artists are represented in the exhibition, displaying work in oils, watercolours, pastels, acrylic, pen and ink and ceramic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Judy's own work is on a grand scale and she has started a landscape which she will work on throughout Open Studios.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's mostly about the mountain because I can't get it out of my system," she says. "The bigger it gets the more challenging it is."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lorraine Halliwell has a mixed media display of watercolour and pastel with small cards supporting her work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Richard and Doreen Cotgrove share a bay, where Richard's oil paintings and Doreen's needlework are on show. Richard's work is all over the world, having been sold in Japan, UK and the US, as well as New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">John Singleton displays his versatility in two and three dimensions. He says he paints in a "glazing" way, removing paint to produce the colours and shades he needs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both John and Richard started life in England where they trained as toolmakers. They met through the Art Society.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One of the bays bears a mixture of work from various artists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the rear of the gallery is the Whanganui District Council Youth Council's Young People's Art Exhibition,&nbsp;<em>New Aotearoa</em>, also on display over the Artists Open Studios weekends.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's for young, local artists to get their work displayed in a way that can be seen by the public in a larger scale event like Open Studios," says Youth Councillor Ara Molijn. "It's open to ages 12 to 24 and we're running it as a competition in age categories."</p>
