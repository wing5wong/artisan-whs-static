On Wednesday 21st January, we held our annual Have A Go Day for all our new year 9’s and new students to Whanganui high School. The students got to play some multi-sport in the Te Wehi gym, experience some of what our Sports Performance programme has to offer, check out our Fit Club, gain a whole bunch of information about all the sports on offer and go for a tour of the school. 

We had 180 students for the morning! Our biggest attendance to date. Such a great initiative . A huge thanks to Mr Greg Fromont and our past student and newest SPP coach Nat Kirk, as well as our Sport Prefects for their time
