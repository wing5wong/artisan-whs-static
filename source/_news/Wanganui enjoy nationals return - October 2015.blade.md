<p><span>BIG LEAGUE: Wanganui's <strong>Sammy Murphy (WHS)</strong> looks to shoot over the Kapi Mana defence at the national championships in Auckland, watched by centre <strong>Haley Addenbrooke (former WHS)</strong>&nbsp;and goal attack Rachael Lynch.</span></p>
<p>It was only a fleeting chance to test themselves on the national stage but the first Wanganui senior representative netball team in 15 years enjoyed every moment of it in Wellington this week.</p>
<p>After picking up two wins from four games in pool play, the Wanganui side were drawn through to the 9-12th section of the play-offs on Wednesday but despite much effort they could not get past Counties Manukau, Kapi Mana and Taranaki.</p>
<p>After around three years, Netball NZ is now likely to do away with the 2015 Lion Foundation National Championships, with Wanganui coach Lisa Murphy saying they are instead going to focus on high performance programmes for Under 23 players.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately this is disappearing, which is disappointing for the grassroots."</p>
<p>This was the first year Wanganui had developed enough players who it was believed could make up a competitive squad, and the victories earlier in the week against Hutt Valley and Hawke's Bay confirmed that.</p>
<p>Wanganui finished 12th overall of 17 centres, while neighbours Taranaki and Manawatu were 11th and 13th respectively, and Hawke's Bay were in a play-off for 16th yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>"Our centres around us, it's great to see Wanganui still up there with them," said Murphy.</p>
<p>Therefore, discussions are underway for the Central Zone area, part of the Pulse catchment, to possibly have their own inter-centre regional senior tournaments, which Wanganui could enter. On Wednesday night against Counties-Manukau, Wanganui faced a south Auckland team unlucky to miss out on the Top 8, and it showed in their physical style.</p>
<p>Wanganui lost 70-42 with the big blow being key goal keep <strong>Kelera Kuruyabaki (former WHS)</strong> being left on crutches with a sprained ankle.</p>
<p>"That sort of did make a big difference in our defensive end," said Murphy.</p>
<p>"They've never given up, even when we've been down on the court."</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon, Wanganui faced Kapi Mana and were beaten 66-54, although the final score did not reflect the closeness of the game with Kapi Mana keeping their strongest line-up on throughout the four quarters.</p>
<p>Te Atawahi McDonnell moved into the defensive circle to partner <strong>Suzanne Guilford (former WHS)</strong>, who Murphy said grew into the role after being a shooter with her Kaierau club and not having been on defence since her schooldays.</p>
<p>Wanganui's final game was yesterday against Taranaki and the tired team were beaten 65-39.</p>
<p>Taranaki had the talented Jessica Tuki, the former Silver Fern and ANZ Championship player, who switched from defence to the shooting circle and dominated at both ends.</p>
<p>Murphy used her entire line-up as everyone was tired after five days of games.</p>
<p>Looking back, Murphy said midcourters <strong>Hayley Addenbrooke&nbsp;<strong>(former WHS)</strong><span>,</span></strong> and Karaihi Peina were dynamic all week, as was Sophie Collins at wing defence.</p>
<p>Shooter <strong>Sammy Murphy&nbsp;<strong>(WHS)</strong></strong> was strong under the post, while <strong>Renee Butler (WHS)</strong> and Rachael Lynch interchanged at goal attack after Lynch recovered from an ear infection earlier in the week.</p>
