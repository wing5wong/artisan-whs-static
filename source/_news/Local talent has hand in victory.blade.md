<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealand Heartland XV and their five Whanganui players had a great start to the Jock Hobbs Memorial Under 19 tournament with an injury time win on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Heartland defeated Auckland Development 19-16 when first-five Tomas Hanham-Carter broke the deadlock with his fourth penalty goal after the 70 minute mark in Taupo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Part of Mid Canterbury's Heartland Championship squad, Hanham-Carter scored all of his team's points, being on the end of a well-constructed try in the corner after multiple phases in Heartland's best attacking period of the game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scores were deadlocked 6-6 at halftime, then Heartland scored 10 points in the 12 minutes after the break to lead 16-6, before Auckland Development came back to level the match.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Assistant coach Justin Lock said the team, who were still learning each others names, had done well considering the Aucklanders had six games together as a playing group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You can't coach heart, and these boys have got buckets of it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's <strong>Dylan Bowater</strong> captained the side from blindside flanker, having previously led the Hurricanes Heartland Under 20's who made up the bulk of the New Zealand squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hamish Bennett was at lock while Harry Symes was on the wing, looking for work as the ball did not often come his way.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dylan Gallien came on as reserve loosehead prop, as did <strong>Chris Breuer</strong> as reserve lock, with Lock saying he was outstanding in the second half.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Normally a loose forward, <strong>Breuer</strong> had to cover lock as fellow Whanganui player Gordon Coogan injured his knee at training on Saturday and has returned home.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Heartland will now face Southland in their next game tomorrow afternoon, after the southerners caused a minor upset with a 32-28 win over Taranaki.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A lot of [preparation] stuff we were looking at was about Taranaki, then Southland got up late," said Lock.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winner of the 4pm match will go onto Saturday's final for the Michael Jones trophy in the second-tier competition, against either Hawke's Bay or Counties Manukau.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The beaten sides from those two games will also face each other.</p>
