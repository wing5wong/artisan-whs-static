<p class="element element-paragraph">It is Whanganui sporting community's glittering evening to get together under one roof when the winners of the 2017 Ray White Whanganui Sports Awards are announced at War Memorial Hall tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Organised by Sport Whanganui, there were around 63 nominees for the main categories this year, with a guaranteed fresh Supreme Award winner at the end of the night, as the 2016 winner, Olympic Games silver medallist Rebecca Scown, is not among the contenders this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In this non-Olympic year, it opens the door for the judges to consider a new raft of potential nominees from a host of sports, with several categories better represented than in recent years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The hosting of the World Masters Games in Auckland and Taupo in late April, early May, meant there is a considerably bigger field with nine nominees who had success either there or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Multiple time winner Krystine Davies will stack her success in the world speedskating championships up against rowers from the Aramoho Whanganui RC contingent, who were dominant on Lake Karapiro.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With more Masters nominated, there was also an uptick for the coach of the year category, recognising those who had helped people get to the games, as well as successes in power lifting and boxing through new names in Kyle Murray and Kylie Albert.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Club of the Year sees decisions having to separate the likes of rugby clubs like Marton and Ruapehu - the Senior and Premier club champions respectively - from the active Rangitikei Netball, the ever growing River City Boxing Club, and the breeding ground for stars which is the Whanganui Multisport Club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For junior team of the year, Hockey Wanganui was well represented by two nominations, alongside the continued success of the Whanganui High School Mixed Touch team and the record-breaking efforts of the Collegiate Junior Relay squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Senior team of the year also has a mix where judges weighed the outstanding National 4WD season of driver Hamish Auret and co-driver Paul Barnes, against the "Heartland Invincibles" of the 2016 Meads Cup winning Steelform Wanganui, with the multiple medals of AWRC's senior coxless quad, not to mention the club title winning Kaierau netballers and Ruapehu rugby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Unsurprisingly, the national junior sportsperson category has the largest nominee list with 13, which just as understandably makes it the hardest to pick a winner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nine different codes have put someone forward, with stalwarts like Emma Rainey (hockey) and Jessica Watkin (cricket) being weighed against the more recent success of weightlifters like Amorangi Piataata Rayner and Dante Karangaroa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The international junior group is a little more exclusive with five nominations, but they are all worthy from top martial artists like Erica Elers (karate) and Finn Brown (judo), through to world championship level attendees Chase Morpeth (speedskating) and Brent Meade (waterskiing).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lawn bowlers Peter Belliss, who has a whole trophy case of Whanganui awards, and Reen Stratford match up against cyclist Glenn Haden and AWRC's finest in Luke Watts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a Scown-less international sportsperson group, there was some real standouts with former supreme winner Kerri Gowler matching up fellow rower Chris Harris, while those with the biggest exposure on national television would have to be Le Man's winner Earl Bamber and rugby stalwart Peter Rowe, who was on-field captain for the NZ Provincial Barbarians in the final quarter against the British &amp; Irish Lions in Whangarei.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The judging was done in October by the committee of Philippa Baker-Hogan, Keith Smith, Grant McKinnon, Ian Glenny and Jared Smith.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the rules, nominees must be affiliated to a Regional Sport Organisation (RSO), club, or appropriate sports body within the Whanganui region.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The other key factor to note is the qualifying period for achievements is actually from October 1 of 2016 through to September 30 of this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This often comes into account for the judging committee for teams or athletes who have their greatest successes in early spring tournaments, often occurring just outside the September 30 time frame and therefore being requested to resubmit for next year's awards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Guest MC for this evening will be 26-game All Black Matthew Cooper, now part of the Sky TV sports commentary team and the CEO of Sport Waikato.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cooper is highly regarded as a public speaker, joining the evening with its buffet dinner and music.</p>
