Congratulations to The Boiz, WHS Gold and I’d Hit that for making the Grand Finals in their grades. And good luck to our other 9 teams… go have fun for the last games of 2025 💪

Also, a huge thanks to all the students who have volunteered as referees and scorers. The games couldn’t run without you 💚
