What a season for our WHS Boys Cricket First XI, securing 3 trophies in 2024. The courage and grit displayed from the boys was immense to win the Whanganui [](<>)Men’s P2 T20 competition, Whanganui Men’s P2 40 Over competition, and the Ross Taylor Bat down in Palmerston North.

WHS started strong in the Whanganui Men’s P1 45 Over competition, with a memorable victory against Collegiate's First XI.

Their victory against Collegiate was particularly impressive, with a strong batting performance by Logan Symes, Nick Burroughs, Harry Burroughs, and Ryan Meredith. Combined with stellar bowling by Charlie Meredith and Regan McRae, WHS prevailed in a tight final over, securing the win. They continued their success by winning the P2 T20 competition in a dramatic final against the Renegades that went to a super over.

Heading to the Ross Taylor Bat in Palmerston North, WHS put in a solid performance, finishing with a net run rate that just edged out St. John's College for the win. Lastly, in the P2 40 Over competition final, a strong partnership between Nick Burroughs and Harry Burroughs, along with key bowling performances by Charlie Meredith and Drew Brennan, helped WHS secure the trophy by 4 runs against Marton Saracens. What an incredible effort and series of achievements for the Boys Cricket First XI this season! 

A huge thanks to coach Steve Meredith for his support and dedication he gives to our 1st XI.
