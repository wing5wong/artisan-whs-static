<p><strong>Great couple of days for our Junior Netball A1 &amp; A2 teams plus 4 tennis players this week hosting Wanganui Park Secondary School from Shepparton, Melbourne.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>The students and families billeted the Aussie students for two nights. </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to all the families that took the billets into their houses.&nbsp;</span></p>
