<p>THREE-WAY SPLIT: Te Reo Paki, Sammy Murphy and Kelera Kuruyabaki battle for possession under the net in last night's Wanganui championship final.</p>
<p>Kaierau found their A game at Springvale Stadium last night to control Wanganui netball's Premier 1 final, coming home 43-37 to deny a valiant High School team a third successive championship.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau team led 8-3 at the first break and had a commanding 25-12 lead at halftime.</p>
<p>Eight unanswered goals at the end of the third quarter and start of the fourth gave Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School hope of a remarkable comeback, but Kaierau steadied the ship to claim their first title since 2012.</p>
