A HUGE Thank you to Mitre 10 Mega and Columbus Cafe for their sponsorship in a fancy new BBQ for WHS Rowing 

Also thanks to Crazy Pumpkin and Mad Butcher [](<>)for supplying fruit, veges and meat for our rowers away at North Island club Champs in the weekend.

We really appreciate local businesses supporting our athletes!
