<p>WHANGANUI secondary schoolboys will again do battle for a place at the national Condor Sevens rugby finals in Auckland during the one-day qualifying tournament next month.</p>
<p>The Wanganui College 7s tournament at City College on October 19 decides the team to represent the River City at the Condor Sevens nationals in Auckland.</p>
<p>Last season, eight teams fought it out with Whanganui High School emerging winners. They then travelled to Kelston Boys College in West Auckland in December where they won the lower tier consolation shield.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Rugby Union has again called for secondary schools in the region to register for the qualifying tournament.</p>
<p>WRU development officer Justin Lock said the October Wanganui College 7s qualifying tournament was for boys' teams only, while the region's girls needed to qualify through the Taranaki union.</p>
<p>Last year seven Whanganui girls teams attempted unsuccessfully to win a spot at the Condor nationals. This year girls sides have the chance to qualify at a Taranaki event on Sunday, November 6.</p>
