<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Classy Whanganui kayakers Toby Brooke and Jack Clifton <strong>have made seamless transitions to ocean ski racing winning their age group divisions in the Vaikobi King and Queen of the Harbour race in Auckland.</strong></h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Already adept at national level in kayak racing, the pair excelled in Auckland with</strong> Brooke (1:38:33) taking third in open line honours and first in the under-23 division, while Clifton won the under-18 class in his first ever ocean ski event.</h4>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Given the forecast 20 knot northeaster, the race directors chose a 23km route known to the locals as the "Gnarly Northerner" from Whangaparaoa Peninsula on Auckland's north shore to finish at the Takapuna Boating Club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was tough conditions which makes it quite technical," Brooke said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The race was won by defending champion Andy Mowlem, who paddled away from the rest of the field, finishing in 1:34:54, a massive 3 &frac12; minutes ahead of second placed and fellow Aucklander Sam Mayhew (1:36:59).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The real race was for second place and was a tremendous dice between Mayhew, Brooke and international legend of the sport, South African Oscar Chalupsky. Chalupsky is a 12-time winner of the world's pinnacle of ocean racing, the Maui Jim Molokai Challenge in Hawaii.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were all pretty close in the same area for the last 10km, but I managed to hold out Oscar for third overall - he's a bit of a legend, but getting older now,' Brooke said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the women's race, Rachel Clarke dominated, coming in 7th overall in the single skis with Rebecca Cole and Danika Mowlem second and third respectively.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Just turned 22, Brooke finished sixth in the K1 1000 and third in the 5km open divisions at the National Canoe Sprint Championships in February, but has taken to ocean racing like the proverbial duck to water.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's the off season for kayak racing now and this was my second ocean race. I finished fifth overall in this event last year and it was Jack's first time ocean racing, so pretty cool for him to win his age group," Brooke said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are similarities in technique, but I enjoy ocean ski racing. It's giving me endurance for when I get back to kayaks. I'm keen to race in the Canadian national ocean ski championships this year and then there's the Gorge Downwind in the United States."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brooke and others at the Whanganui Kayak Club have been coaxing their canoe coach Brian Scott to return to his surf lifesaving roots to gain more experience on ocean paddling.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Brian has a lot of experience and knowledge with his surf lifesaving background and we get out at South Beach at the weekends. We are also running beginners sessions at the Kayak Club at 10am on Saturdays and 3.45pm every Monday and Wednesday and welcome newcomers with a view to coming out to South Beach at some stage," Brooke said.</p>
