<p><span>COSTUMIERS: WHS teacher Linda Hardcastle (left) and Marion Campbell. <br />PICTURE / HARMONY MAY.</span></p>
<p>Busy ladies, Linda Hardcastle and Marion Campbell, had time to talk to me about their work as costume designers and creators while at Repertory Theatre measuring cast members for their Red Riding Hood costumes.</p>
<p>When Linda's four children won parts in&nbsp;<em>Bugsy Malone</em>, Linda offered to help out with the costumes. Earlier experience in creating costumes began when she made costumes for the children's Christmas plays.</p>
<p>"I also made costumes for 'book days' at school, when they dress up as their favourite characters."</p>
<p>What were the most difficult costumes to make?</p>
<p>"Well, I once had to make two hedgehog costumes, each with 250 prickles. The felt prickles all had to be sewn on individually." I concluded that this lady is not only highly skilled but also extremely patient.</p>
<p>When Whanganui High School needed butterfly costumes for their stage challenge production Linda designed them. "The problem was that the wings had to float when they moved their arms. I managed to design wings that would do that," she smiled.<br />"Yes, but she didn't think about how much sewing was involved in each one," added her right hand lady, Marion.</p>
<p>Linda is quietly proud of the fact that Whanganui High School has won the first prize for costume at the National Stage Challenge every year so far. She has good reason to be proud.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Les Miserables</em>&nbsp;was their favourite show to costume.</p>
<p>"I loved making Madame Tenardier's ball dress. Marion and I thought about what could be the most horrible colour combinations. We decided on a purple and orange dress with red bows. Really, it was everything about that show that I loved," laughed Linda.</p>
<p>"The music's lovely and my four children were all involved in it."</p>
<p>Marion and Linda have many costumes to make for&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>.</p>
<p>General factotums Morris and Boris change characters and costumes frequently which makes a lot of extra work for wardrobe mistresses. I have seen some of the costumes and Grandma's big spotty bloomers alone are worth a trip to see.</p>
