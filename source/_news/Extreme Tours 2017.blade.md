<p>During the Easter Holidays the Whanganui High School Outdoor Education Department combined with the International Department to run an <strong>&ldquo;Extreme Tour&rdquo; to the South Island.</strong></p>
<p>The trip was for 13 days and started in Nelson, Greymouth, then down to Fox Glacier, Queenstown, Lake Tekapo, Christchurch, Kaikoura then home to Wanganui.</p>
<p>Some of the activities included &ndash; Sea Kayaking in the Abel Tasman National Park, Quad biking, walking on the longest swing bridge in NZ, Tramps through bush and wet land areas, looking at Glaciers, Puzzling World, Luging, Ice Skating and Hot pools, High Ropes, Jet Boating, and swimming with Dolphins.</p>
<p>It was a full on time, but one that was very enjoyable because of the great group of students that we took. Well done everybody for surviving the &ldquo;Extreme Tour&rdquo; and I am looking forward to running another one next year.&nbsp;</p>
