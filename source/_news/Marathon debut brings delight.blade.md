<p class="element element-paragraph">Nick Berry completed his very first marathon on Saturday - and he won it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 27-year-old Tauranga man was one of 221 people to have completed the Tauranga International Marathon's main event and was the first person over the marathon finish line, completing the 42.2km distance in two hours, 37 minutes and 42 seconds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Though tired and a little sore straight after the race, Berry says taking a win in his first marathon felt "really good".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With a background in cross country running and triathlon at high school level, Berry decided to start getting back into it over the last three years with "a bit of surf lifesaving", also completing half marathons and half Ironman events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it was after completing the Coast to Coast event last year - though unsatisfied with his performance due to not getting his nutrition right - he decided to focus on running.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He says running is easier to juggle around every day commitments and it's what he enjoys most.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's always been my best discipline."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said he knew he wanted to be competitive in Saturday's marathon but given it was his first he had no idea how it would end so his game plan was to "run it the way I wanted to run it".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That plan obviously proved successful.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Starting along Papamoa Beach Rd, Berry described the marathon course as "an amazing" one, which really took "it out of your legs", especially pacing around Mauao.</p>
