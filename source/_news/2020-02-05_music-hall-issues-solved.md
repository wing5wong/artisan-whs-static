“The best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men gang aft a-gley.” So wrote Robbie Burns, and it’s true.

It’s also true that hastily cobbled music halls oft gang astray too. Fortunately, thanks to the kind hearts of noble people things get sorted.

It was frustrating. How dare one of our models become ill, how dare the Opera School hold their final concert on the same night that we’re staging a music hall? It was all very worrying but despite all that, thanks to helpful people, all problems were resolved.

Frances Brown, who contributed her unique baking expertise also helped our models backstage with their quick changes as did Annette McCormack. Frances Robinson also helped the girls backstage and later washed countless supper dishes following the interval.

Carol Teutscher willingly gave of her time and talent yet again when she painted three lifesize figures of our models in period costume. Mike Boag took the painted boards to the Men’s Shed and they cut out the outlines which Mike and Cathy Gribble erected on the veranda roof, eliciting much comment from passers-by.

So . . . on behalf of Rep, thanks to all the good people who made our music hall possible and restored my faith in human goodness. It’s good people like you that make it possible for the good ship Repertory Theatre to continue to sail merrily along. Cheers!
