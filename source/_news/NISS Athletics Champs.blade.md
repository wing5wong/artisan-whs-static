<p><strong>Eleven Whanganui High school athletes qualified for and competed with distinction at last weekend&rsquo;s North Island secondary school athletics in Inglewood. The team of 11 was part of a Whanganui secondary schools team and most were competing at this top level for the 1<sup>st</sup> time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High school group smashed five school records over the weekend with the standout performances being the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> placings in the 800mtrs (2.18) and 1500 metres (4.45) Intermediate girl&rsquo;s finals by Rebecca Baker breaking both school records.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition to this Sophie Andrews threw a school record (40.67) in the Intermediate Girls Hammer for a great 5<sup>th</sup> placing, Travis Bayler took 6<sup>th</sup> placing in the intermediate boys 400mtrs in a school record 52.55sec, and Maysin Katene broke the school record in the Junior boys 300mtrs.</strong></p>
<p>All these athletes are Junior or Intermediate so the future for them and the other athletes competing for high school looks very bright.</p>
<p><span>Well done to the WHS team, Coach Greg Fromont and Manager Elaine Baker.</span></p>
