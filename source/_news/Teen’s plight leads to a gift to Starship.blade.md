<p data-bind="text: $data">A Wanganui teen who was urgently flown to Auckland&rsquo;s Starship hospital for liver surgery last year has been taken to heart by local company Wanganui Finance.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Manager Barb Turner and her assistant Jackie Dowman ensured that their annual charity donation went to Starship last year.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">They gave $1500 to the Starship Foundation.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Barb said their decision was made after hearing the story of 14-year-old Tyler Pomeroy, youngest son of client Becky Stanley.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Last year Tyler&rsquo;s health had started declining rapidly with a huge weight loss, nausea, lack of appetite and fever.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">At first Wanganui doctors were perplexed and worried.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">His mum Becky Stanley said that it wasn&rsquo;t until they saw the results of the scan they knew what was wrong.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Tyler was diagnosed with a liver abscess which they said was very rare and they even thought it was the first ever in New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Even though they were flown to Auckland and were staying in Ronald MacDonald House there was still a cost to the family, she said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so wonderful that people donate to Starship.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Becky will never forget arriving at Starship for Tyler&rsquo;s&rsquo;s surgery and the sudden panic.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Tyler didn&rsquo;t have enough blood for the surgery to go ahead, she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d lost so much weight and blood. He had to be transfused immediately which held the urgent surgery up by two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Becky said after surgery she and Tyler had to stay on in Ronald Macdonald House until he was cleared to go home.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Everyone was was so good to us. We&rsquo;ll never forget it. And Tyler is making great progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Barb said that Wanganui Finance not only worked with mostly local people, it cared about the community and an annual donation was always made to a charity that helped the community.</p>
