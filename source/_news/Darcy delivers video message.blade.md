<p><strong>Darcy Britton has made a video to let others know to look up when he's coming.</strong><br /><em>VIDEO / Stuart Munro</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A blind Whanganui High School student is on a mission to protect the shins of his classmates as well as his cane, known as Shirley.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Darcy Britton has<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6s19hY_uRs&amp;feature=share" target="_blank">made a video</a></strong>&nbsp;to raise awareness about his cane and the fact he can't see students who he says will too often have their heads in their phones.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just did the video to bring awareness that when I'm walking around the school I can't see them ... they have to look out for me a bit, so I didn't keep breaking canes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He's on to cane number seven - they've all been called Shirley. And the video seems to have worked.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everybody gets out of my way now. I haven't had any more canes broken since the video.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Their heads were in their phones ... I can't see them, they can't see me. They're just too busy looking at their phones.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The name Shirley came by as a bit of a joke between Darcy and his mentor.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My mentor, one day she goes 'oh what's your cane's name?' I was like oh Shirley ... just thought I was being smart," Darcy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then she always said to me 'how's Shirley?' and I would say 'oh rather skinny'. She always asked me and so it just stuck."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Darcy always had restricted vision but went blind about four years ago.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I never had full sight ... had about 40 per cent in my right eye and 10 in my left. No peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They tested me for diabetes and that. I didn't have diabetes. I was almost 14 and I went blind and then they said something happened in my life and they said [I] went blind through hysterical blindness, which is trauma."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It wasn't until further tests were done and a brain tumour was found.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was in counselling and that ... I started getting dizzy and bloodshot eyes. When they looked at my eyes they said the cells are dead. When they took me for a head scan they said I had a tumour that was the size of a small fist and I had about four months to live."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He spent about three months in hospital after that but he's managed to live four years after the diagnosis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Darcy said learning to get around with Shirley has been just one of the things he's had to figure out since going blind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Learning Braille's pretty hard .... mostly cooking because you're burning the elements ... you have to be careful around that. That's probably one of the hardest things to do."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At school he likes automotive and music. He wants to work on small motors when he's finished with school like a motorbike mechanic or a lawnmower mechanic.</p>
