##### Youth Week is a nationwide festival of events organised by young New Zealanders to celebrate the talents, passion and success of local young people.

Youth Week recognises the amazing contributions and achievements of young people in New Zealand. The week inspires us to value, support, and affirm the diversity of young people in our society. We want Aotearoa to be a country where young people are vibrant and optimistic and are supported and encouraged to take up challenges.

Events are designed to encourage young people to take on challenges, share ideas and focus on the positive aspects of being young. The week also recognises the youth workers, youth service providers and others working with and for young people.

Each year Youth Week has a different theme designed and voted on by young people across the country. This year the theme chosen is “We're speaking. Are you Listening? E korero ana mātou. E whakarongo ana koutou?”
