Held 9–17 May 2020, Youth Week is a nationwide festival of events organised by young New Zealanders to celebrate the talents, passion and success of local young people.

Each year Youth Week has a different theme designed and voted on by young people across the country. **This year the theme chosen is “We're speaking. Are you Listening? E korero ana mātou. E whakarongo ana koutou?”** Ara Taiohi is the kaitiaki (caretaker) of this nine-day extravaganza.

We’re really keen to get as many young people involved in shaping Youth Week as possible. One of key ways that young people can be involved is through designing the Youth Week poster (and voting on the final choice!).

The winning poster will be printed and distributed nationally to over 2,000 locations, organisations and individuals. We are looking for are posters which are exciting, engaging and represent the theme of this year’s Youth Week!

We have developed a document to support the use of Level 2 VISUAL ART (ART223) 2.3 Design Assessment Activity).
