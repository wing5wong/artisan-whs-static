<p class="element element-paragraph">As nervous fans waited with bated breath the tall figure of Joseph Parker got off the plane and walked into the small Whanganui Airport terminal to silence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He spread his arms wide and mentioned the cold weather outside before people started coming up to shake his hand and ask for photos.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While taking photos with fans, Parker was smothered by four-year-old fan Brylie who wanted a hug from the champion boxer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's the first time Parker has been to Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't go out a lot. I don't travel too much. But when I do travel I see the amazing support and love that we get. It's just great to give back," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Great to come and see them and actually meet them. Meet those who support us from afar when we're fighting overseas or Auckland."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Parker was given a quick explainer in flying by Air Chathams general manager, Duane Emeny, who was the pilot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My flight was good. I sat up in the front and the pilots Duane and Andrew showed me how things were controlled up there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was an enjoyable flight ... little bumps towards the end but it was good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Parker will first head to Putiki Marae for a powhiri where there would also be representatives from the Samoan community.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He will visit <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> and later in the week spend a couple of days in the bush learning about hunting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I love fishing so the only other thing missing is the hunting. So I'm looking forward to actually getting out there doing some hunting, camping out where we are going and actually learning."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui visit hit national headlines when it was first announced with the High School visit originally advertised as a "closed motivational session for MƒÅori and Pasifika boys" and their dads causing outrage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it was never Parker or his team's intention and the school later confirmed it would be open to all students.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Parker said that if he could inspire some of Whanganui's kids, he'd be happy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm looking forward to actually meeting all the students and just giving back because I know there's a lot of support for myself and my team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If I could say something that could inspire or motivates one of the kids then I'll be happy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Parker said he and his team were happy to let local business owner, Chris Kumeroa, and Hayden Potaka from Te Mana Atatu take care of the plan for the Whanganui trip.</p>
