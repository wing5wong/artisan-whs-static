<p><span>STRONG SUPPORT: Kayaker and former WHS student Aiden Nossiter with Wanganui Vet Care Training students Lauren De Vincentis (left), and Elyse Butters after he took them out for a lesson on Whanganui River, with the donation going towards his quest for the Under-23 World Championships.</span></p>
<p>It's a hard way to raise money, but someone's got to do it.</p>
<p>Leading Wanganui kayaker Aiden Nossiter would have been the envy of his fellow New Zealand teammates Max Brown and Toby Brooke as he took the entire class of young ladies from Wanganui Vet Care Training out for a paddling lesson on the Whanganui River yesterday morning.</p>
<p>In the first week of Term 2, the training class always goes out for an event together and gives a koha - donation - for the privilege.</p>
<p>This year, the girls got instruction from Nossiter on kayaking and canoeing on the river, before feeding him a barbecue and presenting a cheque for $200 towards his fundraising for the 2015 Junior and Under-23 World Sprint Championships in Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<p>"It was getting them used to the boats and what we do here," he said.</p>
<p>Nossiter, Brown and Brooke are all hunting for just over $8000 each to attend the world championships, with Nossiter saying he is down to $6700 more required by mid-June.</p>
<p>Whanganui Multisport Club will be holding an barbecue and garage sale to continue fundraising efforts, from 12-3pm tomorrow. Next Friday, May 15, a team quiz night will be held at Stellar Restaurant &amp; Bar with the proceeds going to Nossiter, Brown and Brooke.</p>
