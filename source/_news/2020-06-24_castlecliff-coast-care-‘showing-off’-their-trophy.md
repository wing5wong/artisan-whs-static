Just before lockdown, Progress Castlecliff's Coast Care won the Best Coastal Restoration Project 2020 from the Coastal Restoration Trust of NZ.

They were able to show it off to returning volunteers - Janelle, Clare and Adam from IDEA Services and Sophie, Timon, Fynn and Shiori who came with their teacher, Margot, from Whanganui High School.

Graham Pearson from Progress Castlecliff said, “It was the input from many groups like these volunteers that helped them win the award.”
Graham adds, “We also took the trophy to a Whanganui District Council meeting, as they donate plants and we will also visit local primary school assemblies to acknowledge their contributions as well.”
