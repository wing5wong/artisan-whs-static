<p>WHS 1st XV will take on fully committed Metro men.</p>
<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XV has slipped to third on the Manawatu McDonalds Colts division rugby championship table after a 27-13 loss to reigning champions Massey White at the weekend.</p>
<p>The other Wanganui side, St Johns Club Metro, now sits second on points behind the unbeaten Massey White.</p>
<p>The Wanganui derby clash between WHS and Metro this Saturday will determine the semi-final match-ups the following week.</p>
<p>However, the most likely scenario is a semi-final between Metro and WHS with championship leaders Massey White playing likely fourth-placed Old Boys Marist Colts.</p>
<p>On paper at least WHS would have to be favourites against Metro this weekend after beating the division debutants earlier in round robin play.</p>
<p>Metro is also without one of its star players, fullback Terangatira Waitokia, who has been called into the Wanganui Steelform Heartland squad to play Taranaki B this weekend and possibly make the team to play the Ranfurly Shied against Waikato in a fortnight.</p>
<p>Darryl Malcolm, who co-coaches Metro alongside Carl Gibson, said losing Waitokia to Heartland duties left his side exposed.</p>
<p>"It's really great Te (Waitokia) got selected and we back him 100 percent, but we will miss him," Malcolm said.</p>
<p>"But really we have achieved our goal and more. In our first season in this division we aimed to finish in the Top 6 and we've made that and more. We are in the Top 4 and in the semi-finals and that's down to the guys in our squad and their commitment to the team."</p>
<p>Standings with one round to go before the semi-finals:<br />Massey White 16, Metro 13, WHS 12, Dolphins 5, Marist colts 4, Massey Ag -4.<br />Final round robin draw: Massey White vs Dolphins, Metro vs WHS, Marist Colts vs Massey Ag.</p>
