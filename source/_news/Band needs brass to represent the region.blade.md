<p>Brass Whanganui are calling on community support to help them represent New Zealand in China.&nbsp;<br /><em>Photo / Supplied</em></p>
<p><br />The river city's top brass musicians have been invited to perform on the world stage in September and they are calling on the community to help them get to China.</p>
<p>Brass Whanganui, as New Zealand's reigning top B grade band and multi-award winners for their stunning&nbsp;<em>Thunderbirds</em>, themed marching display at last year's national competitions, has been invited to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Trombone player and band chairman <strong>Jonathon Greenwell</strong> (ex WHS student) said the invitation is a huge honour and Brass Whanganui will be representing New Zealand at the opening parade of the Shanghai Tourism Festival.</p>
<p>"It is a massive event attended by millions of people and watched by millions more.</p>
<p>"The festival is a non-profit event and although they will provide us with meals and accommodation while we are there, we will have to pay for all of our own international and internal airfares."</p>
<p>All 30 band members are committed to going on the trip and Greenwell said they will need to raise around $90,000.</p>
<p>A dedicated group of volunteers have so far managed to raise around 15 per cent of the cost and have set up a Boosted page where supporters can make donations.</p>
<p>The band will also travel within China and will visit Xi'an, home of the famous terracotta warriors.</p>
<p>"We will be part of a group of around 1000 Kiwis invited to the special ceremony as part of the Year of China New Zealand Tourism celebrations.</p>
<p>"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity as we will be the first public group to view some newly discovered warriors."</p>
<p>Brass Whanganui was founded in 2001 with the amalgamation of two of New Zealand's most prestigious brass bands, the Wanganui Garrison Band and Wanganui City Brass.</p>
<p>Several generations of Whanganui families have been part of the band and many players go on to join other brass bands around New Zealand.</p>
