<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFsNKbXLsYs&amp;list=OLAK5uy_kkGYP7iIMxaNtWbO-UV5dGtbccNYcXeQw">"ROSETTA ROAD" Late Night Tales</a></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whatever genre they may (or may not) fit into, their sound is reminiscent of old school NZ bands like Quincy Conserve and the Human Instinct.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Perhaps that is why the neighbours don't complain when they hear Late Night Tales playing loud in their suburban studio and the band get hired to play at 50th birthday parties as well as high school balls.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That's not to say that their music is unadventurous and some of their lyrics would never have passed the censors of 30 years ago but they share a lot of sensibilities with their predecessors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack is the main songwriter and band's new album&nbsp;<em>Rosetta Rd</em>&nbsp;features 10 original tracks with names like&nbsp;<em>BumbleBuzz, Elixir Strings, Prince of Persia</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dad.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are vocal harmonies from Jack and the other lads, with rap sequences from the band's other main vocalist Noah Belchambers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm not involved in the songwriting," says Noah.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I listen to what Jack is singing about and I respond to his lyrics."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band got together at Whanganui High School and they say support from teachers and fellow students has been brilliant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack also credits his mum for allowing them to house their studio at her home and never complaining.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She never tells us to stop or turn it down even though she probably gets sick of it sometimes."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band's oldest member is 18-year-old keyboard player James Rowe, now studying animal science at Massey in Palmerston North, and three other members are due to leave school this year but they plan to keep playing together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are getting a lot of good feedback from the album," says Jack.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There have been approaches from music management companies and we are scheduled for an interview and performance on Jesse Mulligan's show on RNZ in November."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They are planning a Whanganui launch party for&nbsp;<em>Rosetta Rd</em>&nbsp;which is named after the road in Raumati where they stay for "band camps".</p>
