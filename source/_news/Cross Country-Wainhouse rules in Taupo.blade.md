<p class="element element-paragraph">There were prizes aplenty for the Wainhouse family at the Cebris 4 Hour and Motomuck Junior 90 cross country endurance racing in the hills above Taupo on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Around 450 riders, including 28 Whanganui locals, entered the events, with the 4 Hour being one of the biggest cross country races in the North Island.</p>
