<p><strong>Jackie Hazelhurst's passion for her community has helped her to a United World College (UWC) Scholarship.</strong></p>
<p>The Whanganui High School head girl is one of four New Zealanders off to gain admission to a UWC school this year and has been placed at the International School of Asia Karuizawa in Japan.</p>
<p>"It's a little town of 20,000, so it's smaller than Whanganui. The community's quite tight-knit so it'll be nice to get involved," Jackie said.</p>
<p>UWC is a network of 17 international schools aimed at making education a "force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future".</p>
<p>Jackie leaves in August and will be spend the two years in Karuizawa studying towards an International Baccalaureate Diploma.</p>
<p>"I've heard a lot of really good things about Japan. It sounds completely different to anything I've experienced but great at the same time."</p>
<p>The scholarship is aimed at students who have contributed to and shown leadership within their community.</p>
<p>"Firstly it's academic but they want to pick balanced people so they look at all your achievements in different fields and your contribution to the community," Jackie said.</p>
<p>The 17-year old is involved in a number of community activities including the Whanganui District Council's youth committee and volunteers at the Whanganui Regional Museum.</p>
<p>Jackie said opportunities started to open when you get involved in the community.&nbsp;<br />"It's not a chore, it's always something I feel passionate about," she said.</p>
<p>"Things like volunteering at the museum, we've got this really amazing museum with the largest moa bone collection in the world.</p>
<p>"I really want to share what we have with other people."</p>
<p>She encouraged people to find something in their community they were passionate about and get involved.</p>
<p>"Don't force yourself to do something your aren't passionate about because then you won't do a good job. Try to find something you love and then it just grows naturally from there and find people who will do it with you and inspire you."</p>
<p>In Japan Jackie will be doing six subjects and is expected to take on extra-curricular activities and volunteering. "I'll probably do sciences and then English. It will be pretty full on."</p>
<p>She had planned to study environmental law at university next year until this opportunity came up.</p>
<p>"It's completely different than anything I anticipated," she said.</p>
<p>"But doing this first will be really good for meeting people and developing as a person and a lot of people get into United States universities and get scholarships after doing this."</p>
