<p class="element element-paragraph "><br />A month-long fundraising effort has come up with more than $4000 for the New Zealand Meningitis Foundation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">The fundraiser was led by Tarsha and Ricky Boniface, whose daughter, Chloe Boniface, died from meningitis in November last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Tarsha said it was one way the family could deal with the grief of losing Chloe, while also raising awareness and funds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Starting with a goal of $1000, the fundraiser ran for almost all of last month and culminated on World Meningitis Day on April 24.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Tarsha said they used many different ways to get the community involved and support the initiative.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph "><span class="ellipsis">"The</span>&nbsp;<span class="paywall">Meningitis Foundation has wrist bands that a group of girls from the South Island made for one of their friends who passed away from meningitis a few years back.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"So we were selling those, we had a local tattooist give us vouchers to raffle off, we were just asking for donations to get as much as we can in a short amount of time but not to bombard people every day about donating."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">It was shortly after the fundraiser began that Tarsha realised the community was really ready to donate and help the cause, more than she ever expected.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"We thought lets go for $1000, then we thought we might get to $1500 when the tattoo vouchers came in from Inksmiths.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"We were blown away by the community effort, tickets for the tattoo raffles went like hotcakes, it was just amazing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">With the fundraiser being so successful, Tarsha says it may have to be an annual undertaking.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"I think it's going to be a goal for every April now, it's something that we can focus on to give Chloe a voice.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"it's amazing the amount of people who said they didn't know about the symptoms and didn't know there's vaccinations, and it just gets people talking.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">"If one month during our lives I can focus on that and do everything we can, we'll just keep doing it until we can't do it anymore."</p>
