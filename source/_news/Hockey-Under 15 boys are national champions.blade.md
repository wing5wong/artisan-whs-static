<h4>The Wanganui Under 15 boys hockey team with their National Championship medals in Invercargill on Saturday 7 October 2017.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>They have finally done it. After years of runnerup and top four placings, the Wanganui Under 15 Boys side has claimed their National Championship tournament after a dominant week in Invercargill.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Finishing pool play with two wins and a scoreless draw, Wanganui won all three of their playoff games by 2-0 scorelines against North Harbour B, Auckland B and Thames Valley respectively - going through all six matches without conceeding a goal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Extraordinary. At the end of the day, each game we improved upon," said coach Andrew Spence, who had known heartbreak so many times at nationals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The momentum we had just started to build, so when we got to the final, I felt pretty confident we were going to win it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui kept their cool in Saturday's gold medal game with Thames Valley, getting two penalty corner opportunities and converting both of them, while using their advantage out wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">"[Thames Valley] had to hit the ball up the middle so we intercepted a lot," said Spence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>It was a hallmark of their defensive patterns all tournament, with the coach tipping his hat to midfielders Nathan Cohen (WHS student)</strong> and Jack Norman.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our defence was pretty strong and we pushed our defenders into their half. Anything that went down either side or flank we picked off."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>At his third U15 nationals, captain and MVP Connor Hoskin (WHS student) finished with seven goals</strong>, having learned with bitter experience from previous campaigns.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He talked about leading from the front. I think he knew what was required to win the championship," said Spence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Joel Clark got four goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under 15 girls were not as lucky in Timaru, losing their quarterfinal with Auckland B 2-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, they recovered to finish fifth overall by beating Tauranga B 7-1 and Poverty Bay 3-2 in extra time, getting down to nine players each in the shootout after it was 2-2 at fulltime.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>MVP and captain Rebecca Baker finished with a stunning 13 goals from the seven tournament games, including the matchwinner in the final.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She worked really well, as usual," said coach Jan Dixon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I guess it was a little disappointing to lose one game all week and come fifth."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Isabel Brabyn put herself at the post to pick up five goals.</p>
