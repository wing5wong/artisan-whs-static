<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Fifteen-year-old Whanganui High School student James Rountree produced the best result of the city's juniors at the New Zealand Junior Motocross Championships in Mosgiel over the weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Rountree</strong> finished eighth in the national junior 15-16 year 125cc class on his Yamaha YZ125.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With over 200 riders competing for seven titles, it was a busy weekend in Mosgiel where the weather failed to play its part on the first day with rain and wind and a temperature of under 10deg.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Racing was called short on Saturday, but Sunday the weather cleared and all five rounds were completed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other Whanganui juniors included <strong>Oliver Dennison</strong> finishing 11th in the 14-16 year 250cc class, just missing out in the top 10. Some small crashes cost him in some races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Jaxon Watt</strong> rode really well going into the last round tied for 10th place in the 13-16 85cc class, but getting a 13th place in the last race pushed him back to 11th overall by only two points.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youngest of the four Whanganui riders, Jet Ashworth, rode well in trying conditions finishing 12th in the 11-12 years 85cc class on his Italian-built TM 85cc.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There's no rest for the boys as this weekend they will compete at the first round of the Taupo MX series.</p>
