For all those who have been waiting for the return of the Latin American and Spanish Film Festival (LASFF), usually in September/October – you are going to be disappointed. Understandably the various Latin American and Spanish embassies have not had the time to procure and distribute the films due to COVID-19, which has had a serious impact on most of these countries. Hopefully LASFF will return next year.

The month long festival started in Whanganui in 2014 and soon became very popular. There was no admission cost for any of the films and the organisers made the viewing even more enjoyable by explaining the background to the films and often providing food from that country.

Apart from in Wellington, LASFF in Whanganui attracted some of the biggest numbers in New Zealand. The festival developed a loyal following. Numbers increased from around 600 to over a thousand during the six years.

Normally mid-way through the festival, they hosted a party at the Sarjeant on the Quay, featuring Spanish and Latin American music, food and dancing. It was attended also by representatives of the embassies, especially the Chilean Embassy who “adopted us.”  Dance Whanganui literally came to the party, thanks to Argentinian born Rene Olmos, his Russian partner and their group of students.

The organisers said “the council became very supportive covering the cost of the venue for the past two years. We also had around 20 regular sponsors.”

The group also organised a few one-off events such as a performance by a guitar player from Panama and a Mexican Mariachi band. They are confident that when the festival returns, the enthusiasm of film goers will be particularly strong. Watch this space.
