<p><span>SIBLINGS: Wanganui brothers Callaghan, Keightley (WHS student) and Lochlan Watson are now eyeing up Sydney after success at the Auckland International Judo Championships on Sunday.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Wanganui brothers Callaghan, Keightley and Lochlan Watson gained international medal recognition at the Auckland International Judo Championships on Sunday.</p>
<p>Entries from New Zealand, Australia, New Caledonia, Tokelau, Palou, Fiji, Tahiti and French Polynesia ensured good numbers and strong competition.</p>
<p>Callaghan Watson, 9, gained silver in the Junior Boys' U50kg weight division, having gone up a weight group from the U45kg junior boys. He also entered the Junior Boys' Open weight and had success with another silver. Callaghan remains at the top of the table for Junior Boys' NZ U50kg.</p>
<p>Keightley Watson, 14, came up against strong competition in the +66kg Senior Boys' division and took silver. He then went on to fight in the Senior Boys' Open, where he won a bronze. Keightley has also entered the Secondary School Championships for the first time this year in Tauranga on July 5. He is also top of the table for North Island +66kg Senior Boys, and in the top two for New Zealand.</p>
<p>Lochlan Watson, 10, moved to the Senior Boys this year and had just recovered from broken toes at the Waikato Bay of Plenty Championships the previous fortnight.</p>
<p>He fought well in the Senior Boys' U50kg weight group and won a bronze medal.</p>
<p>International success for them all means they now have their eyes on the Sydney International Open in September at the Sydney Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the siblings' next competitions see them head to Auckland for the North Island Championships in September and Tauranga for the New Zealand event in October.</p>
