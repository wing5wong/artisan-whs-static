<p>The red carpet was rolled out for young film-makers at the Wanganui War Memorial Hall last Friday night as the annual awards for the Yeah Hard 30 Second Ad Competition were announced.</p>
<p>The event was started three years ago by Maori development organisation Nga Tai O Te Awa as a positive social media campaign to promote healthy lifestyle options for people in the Wanganui region.</p>
<p>The competition challenges young people to share messages on topics that impact on them - bullying, alcohol and other drug abuse, gambling harm and suicide prevention.</p>
<p>Karney Herewini, Kia Piki Te Ora project manager, said Nga Tai O Te Awa organise and run the competition as a strengths-based approach to raising awareness.</p>
<p>"It is a simple concept which creates an opportunity for young people to share their voices on some real topics - those voices are so powerful they can really change the world."</p>
<p>Participants can enter the competition as individuals or part of a group which provides opportunity to work together on a vision, as they plan, script, act, direct, edit and produce a short advertisement to share with the world.</p>
<p>Mr Herewini said all the entries were posted on the Yeah Hard Facebook page and by last week they had been viewed by almost 17,000 people.</p>
<p>"The support from our community, schools, local businesses and sponsors has been wonderful and generous with positive feedback from near and far.</p>
<p>"The Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand also saw the value of one group's message on gambling harm and shared the advert' with their followers," said Mr Herewini.</p>
<p>-This year's competition saw 125 young people aged from 3 to 18 years participating and the winners were:</p>
<p>12 years and under category winners - I Got Your Back, C.A.T.S. Be a Legend winner, The No, No, No, Squad. What's up winner, Fast and Furious.</p>
<p>13 to 18 years winners: Be a Legend category , Studiosity; I Got Your Back category, The Anti Bullies; What's up category, Kokohuia.</p>
<p>Judges' choice - Best actors, Isabel Cameron Whyte (The Anti Bullies) Wanganui Intermediate School, Taonga Herewini (Fast and Furious) Wanganui East School, Jesse Rice (YMCA) YMCA Whanganui. Ipad winner - Baily Fabish, Wanganui Intermediate.</p>
<p>In true Oscars style, the winners were presented with gold figurines in the form of little troll characters.</p>
<p>Karney Herewini said the troll dolls are a "good ice-breaker and conversation starter" and have become mascots for Yeah Hard.</p>
<p>Yeah Hard is sponsored by the WDC Youth Committee, Cognition Education, Pak'n Save Wanganui, McDonald's and Domino's Pizza.</p>
