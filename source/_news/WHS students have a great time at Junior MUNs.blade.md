<p>On Thursday 1&nbsp;November students from WHS joined students from other schools in Whanganui to take part in the annual Junior MUNs day held at Whanganui Girls&rsquo; College.</p>
<p>Students were required to &lsquo;represent their chosen country at the UN&rsquo;. To do this they dressed up, decorated their tables and even brought in food they had prepared from their chosen country.</p>
<p>The topics under discussion were the UN response to Climate Change and the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. Students had to deliver speeches they had prepared giving the perspective of their country, and then lobby to get other countries on their side to draft amendments to resolutions.</p>
<p>At lunch time the students all shared their delicious dishes and then Angus Pikethley played &lsquo;Flower of Scotland&rsquo; on his bagpipes.</p>
<p><strong>WHS students are to be congratulated on being well prepared and confident participants. In the end students representing Scotland were award the Best Dressed Prize and Russia won for their food. For Best delegation students representing Greece, Chile and China received merit awards, with the overall Best Delegation Prize going to the United Arab Emirates. Callum Sinclair representing the UAE, was conjointly named the Best Speaker.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well done to all the students who took part. It was a super day.</strong></p>
