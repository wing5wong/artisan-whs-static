<p>WORDS IN PICTURES: &nbsp;Young artists Aria Plumridge-Shaw (back left) Payton McIntyre, Te Paerata Tichbon (WHS), Ashleigh Clarke (WHS), Ryan Peralta (WHS), Na-Keta Clarke (WHS), Seth Chadfield and Jhonelle Kara. &nbsp;Mana Chase-Pickering was absent.</p>
<p>The old McGruer's Building on the corner of Victoria Ave and Guyton St was alight with warmth, music and bright artworks last Friday night as nine young Wanganui artists opened their debut exhibition.</p>
<p>The exhibition, 27 Thousand Words, was due to open at the Whanganui Community Arts Centre in June but had to be cancelled because of flooding.</p>
<p>After journalist Duncan Garner commented on Wanganui's empty shops, the young people thought it would be a good idea to hold an exhibition in one of the empty retail spaces.</p>
<p>The young artists have been working with the CAYAD (Community Action Youth and Drugs) team from Nga Tai o Te Awa Trust to use art as a medium to express a positive youth voice.</p>
<p>Project facilitator Julie Herewini said each young person has produced three exhibition pieces and the name for the show is based on the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words."</p>
<p>"All exhibition works are for sale and the rangatahi (young people) will donate 25 per cent of each sale to a charity of their choice," Mrs Herewini said.</p>
<p>"During the lead-up to the exhibition, the young people met regularly to plan and learn about how to present their pieces for exhibition and visited Gallery on Guyton to hear from experienced artists who are part of Manawa Ora, the Whanganui Maori artists' collective."</p>
<p>The participating artists are aged from 13-26 and all attend high schools and tertiary learning centres in Wanganui.</p>
<p>Some of the artists are members of Wanganui High School group Contraband and visitors to the exhibition opening were treated to performances of original music as they viewed the art.</p>
<p>The exhibition is open for two weeks and the temporary gallery is open from 9am-5pm weekdays, 10am until late afternoon Saturday and 10-1pm Sunday.</p>
