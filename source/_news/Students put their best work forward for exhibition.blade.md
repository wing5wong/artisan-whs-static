<p class="element element-paragraph">A diverse range of art is on display at the Edith Gallery for the Test Space exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The exhbition contains work by 17 students in their second year of a bachelor in design and art at Whanganui UCOL. The students are majoring in fashion textiles, visual arts or graphic design.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fashion tutor Stephanie West said each major has its own separate brief for the exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These are second-year students, so they are just starting to get confident in their own work," Ms West said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>For fashion students <strong>Paige MacDonald</strong> and Erana Kaa, it's their first time exhibiting.</span></p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Erana said the exhibition underlined the wide variety of work produced in the bachelor of design and art.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Paige</strong> said the exhibition pieces showcased what they had been doing all semester.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Graphics student Sarah Barron said she and her fellow classmates had only a short time to get their work together for the exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Visual arts student Lucja Orlowski said although the work was very varied it came together well as an exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Third-year students are also holding their exhibitions. The third-year graphic design students are showing their exhibition,&nbsp;<em>Legacy</em>, in the UCOL atrium. The third-year fashion textiles and visual arts exhibition, Liminal Spaces, is showing at Whanganui Arts @ the Centre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">+The exhibitions will be open until November 27.</p>
