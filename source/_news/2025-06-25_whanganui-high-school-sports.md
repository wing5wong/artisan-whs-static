A Huge Weekend for Lucas at the Wellington International Judo Competition – King’s Birthday Weekend

Saturday saw him achieve an incredible feat: GOLD in three age brackets – Cadets, Junior Men, and Senior Men. An outstanding effort for his first year stepping up to the Senior Men's grade.

Sunday brought a whole new challenge as he stepped into unfamiliar territory with Kata judging and competition. To top it all off, Lucas earned his Shodan (black belt) – a massive milestone and truly well deserved!

We’re also incredibly proud to announce that in July 2025, Lucas has once again been selected for the New Zealand Squad. He’ll be travelling to Hong Kong and Macau, China, during Weeks 1, 2, and the beginning of Week 3 of Term 3 for intensive training and international competition.
