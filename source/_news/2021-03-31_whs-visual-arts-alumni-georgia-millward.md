***What have you been doing since you left Whanganui High School?***  

When I finished school, I was pretty set on going straight to Massey University to study Visual Communications. However, being a fresher, they encourage you to explore all areas of the art/design department before committing to a particular major. I must have found this helpful as I spent the following three years studying something different and walked out with a Bachelor of Design with Honours Majoring in Industrial Design. I can't say that I was 100% certain at the time with my choice (being the indecisive person I am), but I followed my gut, and I am so glad that I did.  

Since completing my studies, I have moved back to Whanganui and joined a start-up called Bullet Cup, for which I am currently the Design and Account Manager. Between all of my friends from university, you will be amazed at the scope of which areas you can work in when you have a design degree under your belt.

***Do you continue to pursue your creativity in your own time?***  

I am constantly immersing myself in creative projects or trying something new. These days, you will catch me shooting film on my vintage camera, editing photos, experimenting with oil paints, and even having an attempt at resin art and sewing. I think that being creative in your own time is so valuable. It allows space to develop a personal style without any pressure.

***How do you support yourself?***  

I found myself a permanent and secure position at Bullet Cup, and I have also been dabbling in some freelance design in my spare time. It's been fun having a few different things on the go.  

***What skills, learnt in the Arts, have been useful in your career since whs?***
Getting a grasp of the Adobe software (even just the basics in Photoshop and Illustrator) has been so valuable for me since leaving school. It gave me a lot more confidence when I started university, and it has allowed me to be more resourceful with various jobs I've undertaken.

***Which Arts subjects did you do at school?***

I took visual communications, painting, graphic design, and dance.

***What other life skills did you learn in your Arts subjects?***

If painting taught me something important, that is patience, patience, patience. 
And sometimes, all you need to do is stand back and look at the big picture because things can end up looking much better from a distance. This classic and cheesy quote helped me through some very frustrating and stressful moments at uni.

***What advice would you give to our current art students?***  

• Don't stress about the small stuff.  
• Push the boundaries and be different.  
• Take risks.  
• Allow disappointment to drive change.  
• Don't leave things until the last minute (create a Gantt chart before jumping into a project).  
• Ask for advice and other people’s opinions, it’s also ok to ask for help.  
• Try something new and continually challenge yourself.  
• Have fun!
