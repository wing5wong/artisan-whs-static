<p><br />UCOL Whanganui has been celebrating Puanga all week with nourishing winter food and the Wednesday celebrations coincided with the launch of a new student pantry.</p>
<p>Whanganui and Taranaki iwi celebrate the appearance of the Puanga star that appears in the winter sky each year and signals the beginning of the MƒÅori New Year.</p>
<p>Student Life co-ordinator Elise Goodge said Puanga is a time of togetherness and sharing, so it was an appropriate time for UCOL to launch its new pantry.</p>
<p>"The student pantry will be a place for students, staff and the community to leave food for students to take when they need it.</p>
<p>"The kaupapa or purpose is to leave what you can and take what you need.</p>
<p>"We want to ensure that no student goes hungry."</p>
<p>Goodge said the pantry will not only provide some good nourishment for those who need it but also help minimise food wastage.</p>
<p>On opening day, the pantry was already stocked with donations of fresh vegetables, lemons and a range of canned and packaged food.</p>
<p>Donations can be dropped off at the pantry in UCOL Whanganui atrium which is open from 7am until 7pm on Mondays to Fridays,</p>
<p>The launch coincided with UCOL Whanganui's first Connect event.</p>
<p>Connect is a monthly student-focused event bringing students together for free kai, music, and activities, and to find out about different services available to them at UCOL and around the community.</p>
<p>Enjoying a free soup lunch were students Ciana Kui studying towards a national certificate in security, music and performance student Roema Tatupu and art student Summer Ruissen-Hohaia.</p>
<p>"It's nice to have these events on campus and the soup is really tasty," said Kui.</p>
<p>Tatupu joined her class for a live lunchtime music performance during the event as well.</p>
<p>Student advocate Rebekah O'Donoghue introduced herself at the gathering and said she is available to support students with complaints, hardship applications and Work and Income appointments.</p>
<p>"I cover Palmerston North and Wairarapa as well as Whanganui and I'll be here fortnightly on Mondays."</p>
<p>O'Donoghue is a member of UCOL's student success team working to provide information, support and access to community services.</p>
