Hospice Whanganui, New Zealand

Thank you, Whanganui High School 💙

In October, Business Studies students from Whanganui High School carried out customer surveys across our three Hospice Whanganui retail shops gathering valuable feedback on everything from customer service to store layout and pricing.

This project grew from conversations at our August retail hui and reflects how important community insight is as we plan the future of our shops.

A huge thank you to Claire Libeau for coordinating the project, to the students for their professionalism and enthusiasm, and to everyone in the community who took the time to share their feedback.

We’re proud to support real-world learning opportunities like this, and grateful for the care and thought shown throughout this collaboration.
