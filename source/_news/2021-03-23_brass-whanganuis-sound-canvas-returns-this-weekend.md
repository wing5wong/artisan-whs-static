It's part of Artists Open Studios, but Brass Whanganui's Sound Canvas includes art of all kinds, including performance, visual, aural and unpredictable.


Percussionist Hayden Davis is vice-chairman and treasurer of Brass Whanganui.

This year, again, both band, art and audience will be on the Royal Whanganui Opera House stage.


"Again, a unique perspective for the bulk of the audience, who are used to sitting on the other side. Instead, they see what we would normally see, as well as experiencing that space in the Opera House that we feel is quite special," says Hayden. "It has a beautiful character to it."


Each Sound Canvas performance is different.

"It has its own unique flavour and tone. There are some things going on that even the band won't find out about until rehearsals," says Hayden.

**Bruce Jellyman** is the band's musical director.


"Bruce is good at identifying talent within the band and using that in different ways, not necessarily with brass instruments."


In previous performances band members have sung, recited poetry, produced sound effects and much more.


"It's a matter of pairing the right people with the right pieces."


**Hamish Jellyman**, Bruce's son, has written brass band pieces especially for this performance.

"He's becoming quite prolific in terms of composing for us."


Hayden does not want to call Sound Canvas a brass band performance, and with good reason, because there are so many other elements that make up the show.

"It's intentionally loose, it's flowing, and it's designed to be an experience, not just a musical observation."


As part of Artists Open Studios, art will be shown on a screen during the performance.  Bruce has chosen the art to work in with the music and other parts of Sound Canvas.

"We're always trying to push how it feels and looks and try and take a few risks."

Hayden says the Sound Canvas concept has wide appeal. "It's appealing to a younger crowd who are enjoying a very different musical experience. "It's also exciting for us to do a concert that's different: there are no other bands doing a concert like this."


**Sound Canvas is a Bruce Jellyman original concept.**
