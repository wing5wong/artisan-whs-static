<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual Latin American and Spanish Film Festival is returning to Whanganui for the fourth time thanks to a group of Hispanic enthusiasts living in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Antonio Salas, Andrea Gardner,</strong> <strong>(and WHS teachers); Queralt Scott, Marilyn Wilkie and Beverly Stuart, with support from Whanganui District Council, are bringing 11 films to Whanganui audiences with free screenings from October 19 until November 11.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 11 feature films come from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Mexico, Cuba, Ecuador and Spain and will screen on Thursdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>All movies are free and will show in the Davis Lecture Theatre on Thursdays at 7pm, with matinee screenings at 4pm on Saturdays.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chilean ambassador to New Zealand, Rodrigo Espinosa, will attend a special fiesta celebration at the Sarjeant Gallery on October 21.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event will feature Hispanic food, music and dance and another special feature of this year's festival will be the release of a new single and video from Grammy Award-winning Panamanian singer and songwriter R&oacute;mulo Castro.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Castro visited Whanganui in February this year and recorded part of the song with local young Maori and Whanganui High School students.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The song and video will be released on October 26 when students at High School will get the chance to watch it for the first time.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"All the movies in this year's festival have won awards around the world, including at Cannes," says Marilyn Wilkie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"By chance, many of them feature children, and are stunningly well-acted.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The offerings from Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Ecuador tackle the issue of child poverty and how children find hope when the world seems pitted against them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are comedies from Argentina, Peru and Uruguay which Ms Wilkie says "take a gentler and happier approach to inter-generational difficulties and responsibilities".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The films tackle universal concerns that everyone will relate to," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The first screening on October 19 will be Argentinian comedy,&nbsp;<em>Son of the Bride (El hijo de la novia)</em>&nbsp;directed by Juan Jos&eacute; Campanella.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and won the Silver Condor for Best Film when it was released in 2001.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Son of the Bride</em>&nbsp;will screen at Davis Theatre, Watt St at 7pm on October 19.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The festival schedule and movie details can be picked up from the Sarjeant Gallery, Whanganui District Library, i-site and from local cafes, or by going to&nbsp;<a href="http://lasffnz.co.nz/venues/" target="_blank">lasffnz.co.nz</a>.</strong></p>
