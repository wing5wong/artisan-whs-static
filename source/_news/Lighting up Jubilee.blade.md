<p>Wanganui Lightning United's Joshua&nbsp;Ashworth (former WHS student) takes the puck down the boards against the Wellington Jokers at Jubilee Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Wanganui Lightning United came second once again in the middle tournament of the three which make up the Senior A League at Jubilee Stadium at the weekend.</p>
<p>The team will stay in contention to win the inline hockey title heading into the final tournament in Kilbirnie this month, alongside the Levin Thunder Rebels and Rimutaka Renegades.</p>
<p>Games over the weekend were the first held in Whanganui in three years, and the Lightning relished home advantage on Saturday by beating competition leaders the Rebels 9-4, Tawa Typhoons 7-4 and the Capital Penguins Wellington Jokers 5-1.</p>
<p>However, the wheels came off yesterday, as they lost to the Renegade's from Upper Hutt 4-1, then were beaten by the Napier Sharks 6-4 in a tough game with eight penalties given to both sides.</p>
<p>"Overall it was a good weekend of hockey," said Lightning United club secretary Sandra Ashworth.</p>
<p>"Everyone was mentioning how good it was to be back in Whanganui - they love this floor, love these facilities."</p>
<p>Renegades won all five of their games to take the maximum 10 points from the weekend, while Lightning were second with six points.</p>
