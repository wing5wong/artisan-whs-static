<p><span>NO WAY THROUGH: Metro first-five and former WHS student Hareangi Meihana takes on WHS tackler Sheldon Pakinga-Manhire.</span></p>
<p>Whanganui High School 1st XV victorious in the first Whanganui derby of the McDonald's Manawatu Colts competition on Saturday.</p>
<p>Taking on St Johns Club Wanganui Metro Colts at the school grounds, WHS edged the match 26-24.</p>
<p>The two sides had already sealed a place in the Top 6 phase of the competition but this match was a chance for local bragging rights.</p>
<p>It was exhibition rugby, too - a fast-running game and a duel of the backlines.</p>
<p>Long periods of possession reaped points for both sides but perhaps a slightly more desperate defensive effort from WHS made the difference.</p>
<p>It started differently, though, with Metro fullback Te Rangatira Waitokia cleaning up loose ball to coast through the home side's defences to open the scoring in the first few minutes.</p>
<p>But from there WHS dominated the first half - racking up 19 points in a 20-minute stretch.</p>
<p>Boult had been threatening and got his side's first try on the back of multiple phases for WHS.</p>
<p>Minutes later, Ayzak Bennett plucked the ball from the sky for an intercept try as Metro attempted to move it wide.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Boult had his second in the 23rd minute that Metro began to wrestle back some control, working their way into handy positions on several occasions.</p>
<p>The back end of the first half was a key period with Metro seeking some sort of parity by the break.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Instead, WHS managed to shut down the visitors' attack early and win enough turnover ball to maintain a 14-point lead at halftime.</p>
<p>Both teams had proven equals in terms of on-field play but Metro needed that to be reflected on the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Reward finally came when No8 Corbin Warren charged over for the visitors in the 50th minute to spark a rally.</p>
<p>As the game entered the final quarter, Metro had WHS pegged on their line and won a scrum against the feed.</p>
<p>Having just come on the field, John Iro snatched the ball to score from close range and narrowed the gap to two, setting a conclusion worthy of a derby.</p>
<p>But it was the man of the first half who sealed the match for the schoolboys as Boult completed his hat-trick with about 10 minutes to go.</p>
<p>Laurence Weber's 75th-minute try put Metro one scoring play away from snatching the win but WHS were able to hold on.</p>
