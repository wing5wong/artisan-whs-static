<p>OFF STATESIDE: &nbsp;Wanganui's All White and former WHS student&nbsp;James Musa will playing for the Saint Louis Football Club in 2015.</p>
<p>WANGANUI'S football export James Musa has another stamp for his passport.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old All Whites defender has signed a two year contract with Saint Louis FC, an expansion team in the United Soccer League (USL), playing Division III level in the United States.</p>
<p>The franchise was founded in May last year and plays at the 6200-seat St Louis Soccer Park in Fenton, Missouri.</p>
<p>After returning to New Zealand following his trial with Fulham FC in England, Musa split his time playing for Team Wellington in the ASB Championship and Southern Melbourne FC, who won the Victorian state competition.</p>
<p>He made his debut for the All Whites off the bench against South Africa in May, then went to the training camp to China and Thailand in November under new coach Anthony Hudson.</p>
<p>"I am excited to commit to Saint Louis FC and embark on a new challenge in the United States," Musa said.</p>
<p>"After speaking with head coach Dale Schilly and performing my research on Saint Louis FC as a club and city, I am confident that it is the right environment for me at this stage of my career.</p>
<p>"I want to thank my coaches and the entire staff at Team Wellington and Southern Melbourne FC for helping me the past couple of seasons and prepare me to re-enter a professional environment."</p>
<p>It is the latest paying contract of his career, which started back as a 17-year-old with the Wellington Phoenix in 2010-11.</p>
<p>Hudson, who also played and coached in the USL, endorsed the transfer after he spoke with Musa and the Saint Louis coaching staff.</p>
<p>"I am really pleased and believe it is a good move for him at this point in his career to seek a new challenge in the United States," Hudson said.</p>
<p>"I have been hugely impressed with James, after seeing him play in person while he was with the full national team in China during our recent training camp, and he is someone who will be a part of the All Whites if he continues his progression, which I expect to happen in St. Louis."</p>
<p>Musa is hopeful of being selected for New Zealand's coming friendly game against South Korea Republic in Seoul on March 31.</p>
<p>Saint Louis FC grew out of the respected youth club St Louis Scott Gallagher, which Schilly has been with since 1994, where he groomed young players who went on to make the United States national team.</p>
<p>Schilly and general manager Jeremy Alumbaugh have signed Musa among the allotted seven international slots available, with the plan for him to be a leader on defence, playing mainly as a left footed central defender, who is versatile enough to cover left back.</p>
<p>"Saint Louis FC is pleased to acquire someone with James' background," said Alumbaugh.</p>
<p>"He has a proven track record as a player, but perhaps what is most exciting is his desire to improve and build his game.</p>
<p>"He fits into the mentality we are building with the club.</p>
<p>"Many thanks to Stone Sports Management and The Pitch Management for their tireless efforts to make this signing happen."</p>
<p>Saint Louis is also affiliated to the Chicago Fire SC, who play in Major League Soccer, the highest professional level in the United States and Canada.</p>
