<p><strong>WHS teacher Graham Hall with the Whanganui River Print.<br />Printmakers capture essence of Whanganui River.<br /></strong>(Below are the prints made by WHS students/teachers/former teachers that have contributed to this magnificent art piece).</p>
<p>It's 20m long and is made of 42 panels, each one produced by a different artist.</p>
<p>It's the Whanganui River Print, a woodcut representation of the Whanganui River on paper.</p>
<p>The project was organised by Graham Hall, a printmaker and art teacher at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p>"I came up with the idea as a way of acknowledging the community of printmaking artists in Whanganui. We always hear about glass artists, but there are many printmakers as well," Mr Hall said.</p>
<p>"I'm also hoping it will generate a lot of conversation about the river."</p>
<p>The printmakers range from established artists in the field to Year 9 students at Whanganui High School. Workshops were held to teach novices the techniques of woodcuts.</p>
<p>As well as printmakers from Whanganui, some from Wellington and Auckland have also contributed panels.</p>
<p>"It was up to the artists themselves how they interpret the brief," Mr Hall said.</p>
<p>The print image was made in a woodcut before being put on paper.</p>
<p>He said the artwork, which was printed last weekend, came together very easily in the end.</p>
<p>"With so many people, it could have been a nightmare."</p>
<p>And Mr Hall is hoping to find a suitable venue to hang the print in - he's hoping the i-Site will accept it.</p>
<p>"I think it will look great hanging in the atrium area."</p>
