<p>WHS Boys and Girls Softball teams compete at Fraser Park, Hutt Valley for the Division 2 North Island Secondary School Champs, Tuesday 28 March - Friday 31 March 2017.</p>
<p>31 March<br />Secondary Schools Softball 2017 Tournament done and dusted.<br />Whanganui High Boys lost to Upper Hutt College this morning. They had a good tournament with a couple of wins under their belts. Majority of the team should be back next season.<br />Good luck Eman Savage and Chase Pauro and congratulations for leading your team this year.<br />Whanganui High Girls had a very dramatic game against Napier Girls. The team lead 4-2, but NGHS batted in 6 runs in the 4th innings. Then a major blund<span class="text_exposed_show">er from the Umpire our coach and the team riled up. The girls went into their last turn at bat 8-2 down. The bats started connecting with Shanice leading off. Hinekorangi got on the bat and Leighton connected too. Runs scored by Dharma and Emma. Loaded bases and Mahinarangi Millar-Potaka cuts the ball down right outfield scoring everyone on base and herself. What a way to finish a game.&nbsp;<br /></span>WHS winners 12-8, placed 5th in a very competitive competition.<br />Well done to my ladies Emma Rainey, Mahinarangi Millar-Potaka, Mikaya Teki, Daina Pa'a, Melany Brown and Miho Noriyasu on you contributions to Softball for Whanganui High &nbsp;<span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" src="https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/f30/1/16/26be.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span><span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" src="https://www.facebook.com/images/emoji.php/v8/f30/1/16/26be.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span></p>

<p>30 March<br />Day three results from our WHS Softball teams had the boys going down to a very mouthy Paraparaumu College team 13-4. But the team lifted in their second game against Kapiti College. The boys got a batting spree going in the 4th innings starting with Eman getting walked. The team got on base and Chase hit in 2 runs. Going right through the batting order with Eman coming up again to hit a solid 3 bagger scoring 3 runs. The High School boys won 8-4.<br />The girls first game was flu<span class="text_exposed_show">stered from the start. Lytton High capitalised on the bat scoring every innings. The girls were down 8-0 heading into their last turn at bat. The girls scored 8 runs with hits from Daina and Mikayla. Then went into a tie-breaker and eventually went down 11-10. The ladies second game was a great game to watch. Miho was great on the mound and the bats finally connected. The team won 12-4 against Hutt Valley High.</span></p>
<p>29 March<br />Heading into Day Two of the SSDiv2 Softball Tournament held at Fraser Park. The boys play Napier Boys and Wellington College today. Day One results saw the team beat Tolaga Bay 5-1, with some great pitching/catching duo by Eman and Chase. Devon had a couple of safe hits bringing in most of the runs. The second game saw the boys come against St Pats Town. A very big in height, strong in bat team. With the boys going down 15-2.<br />The girls have Tolaga Bay and Aotea College today<span class="text_exposed_show">. Much needed wins to be placed in top four. Yesterday's results had the girls play Hutt Valleys SS winners Taita College. A very mixed up game with long substitutions, batting out of order, illegal batting, illegal running. The girls went into their last turn at bat 8-1 down and we eventually lost 8-7. Then we played Napier Girls. And went down 15-7. A good eye opener for some of the girls but a new day today.</span></p>
