<p>WORTH IT: &nbsp;While she no longer wants to be a doctor, Anastasia O'Leary recommends the experience to others.</p>
<p>Standing feet away from wide-awake patients with their insides on display, it occurred to 16-year-old Anastasia O'Leary that she wouldn't find this kind of experience in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Wanganui High School prefect was in her second week shadowing doctors in a hospital in Tanzania, and things were still taking her by surprise.</p>
<p>"They don't have, like, general anaesthetic," she said from her Springvale home.</p>
<p>"They only had local so the patients were always awake."</p>
<p>It was during her week in the surgery department of Morogoro Hospital in the southern highlands of Tanzania that Anastasia realised she didn't want to be a doctor after all.</p>
<p>She described seeing a baby with a face burnt from having boiling water spilled on it, as well as other horrible injuries and illnesses.</p>
<p>"I just kind of looked at the doctor. I thought in my mind, 'do I want to be in their place'? I just thought, no.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">All the people with things wrong with them and no cure.</span></p>
<p>"It was just like sick kids but you couldn't really see what was wrong with them. I saw a 7-month-old baby die because it had malaria."</p>
<p>Seeing babies die was one of the hardest parts for Anastasia, who said malaria was rife in Tanzania.</p>
<p>She remembered the struggle to find oxygen for one child when a power cut left the hospital without electricity for hours.</p>
<p>An oxygen tank was found for the baby, and the students would come into the ward each day to check on it, but it died seven days later.</p>
<p>"It just happens all the time there," she said.</p>
<p>Anastasia was among a group of young students who headed to the East African country to follow doctors in the hospital and observe healthcare in a Third World country.</p>
<p>She was the only student from New Zealand on the trip, which cost $10,000 through Gap Medics, a company which provides the opportunity for students to get physician-shadowing experience.</p>
<p>"I was in the hospital for two weeks shadowing doctors around and just seeing what they do," she said.</p>
<p>"Watching the actual surgeries wasn't too bad. They were legit, they weren't dodgy."</p>
<p>While in Tanzania, Anastasia and the other students visited an orphanage as well.</p>
<p>"That was pretty shocking," she said.</p>
<p>"The kids were so happy but it was just like this big concrete place. No grass, no balls to play with - but the kids are so happy."</p>
<p>Despite deciding from the experience she did not want to be a doctor, Anastasia recommended Gap Medics to other students interested in medicine, and said it was experience they could not find in New Zealand.</p>
<p>"There's no way that they would let you be a metre away from surgery here.</p>
<p>"I just learned so much about different health things."</p>
<p>Instead of becoming a doctor, Anastasia felt herself drawn more towards medical research, and hoped to work on finding cures for some of the diseases she saw people fighting in the Morogoro Regional Referral Hospital.</p>
<p>"That would be really cool," she said. "I'm not great at science at school, I just really like the idea of being able to help."</p>
