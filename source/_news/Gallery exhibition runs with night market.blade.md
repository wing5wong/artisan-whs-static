<p><span>NIGHT ART: Carla Donson (left) and Sarah Williams with works by Mike Marsh and <strong>Whanganui High School teacher Graham Hall.</strong></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">If you have not seen the latest exhibition at Space Gallery there's a chance for night-time viewing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The gallery will be open tomorrow night and there will be opportunity for shopping and a bite to eat at the night market as well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Women's Network manager Carla Donson and Space Studio and Gallery owner Sarah Williams invited artists' contributions for a special La Fiesta exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>WO:MAN - Women as seen by men</em>&nbsp;is a group exhibition by male Whanganui artists portraying women.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some of the works are depictions of recognisable, local women like B.T. Ardell's digital prints and Paul Rayner's oil pastel portraits.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mark Rayner has depicted Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern looking saintly on a ceramic plate while <strong>Graham Hall has depicted women in classical poses in his&nbsp;<em>Woman as Temptress</em>&nbsp;piece.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">David Murray's cast glass work,&nbsp;<em>Exhale the Last</em>, is a poignant tribute to Elizabeth Hardwick-Smith who died in an accident while living overseas.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ivan Vostinar's two ceramic works,&nbsp;<em>Nurture</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Grace Through Hardship</em>, are reminiscent of pagan goddesses and Craig Winton's mother of pearl necklace is reversible so it can be worn white or golden.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Anthony Davies' mixed media work,&nbsp;<em>War Games</em>, and Mike Marsh's already sold portrait of a mystery woman round off the exhibition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Night market and exhibition from 5.30 to 8.30pm Saturday, February 24, at 64 Taupo Quay.</strong></p>
