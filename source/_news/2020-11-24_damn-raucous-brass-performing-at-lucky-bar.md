Damn Raucous Brass are in rehearsal for the coming summer festival season. You have seen them on the public stages at Vintage Weekend and Masters Games serving up their own version of the world wide thing that is 2nd line brass band. Not the English type brass band that you may know, but as a New Orleans street jazz brass band, full of brass raucousness, energy and artistic goodness. 

The bands musicians all come from Whanganui lead by **Bruce Jellyman (Trombone and vocals) and Hamish Jellyman (Trombone and vocals)** with Chris Scudder (Trombone), Tahu Pikimaui (Lead trumpet), Ben Thompson (Guitar and Trumpet), Garry Vinnell (Trumpet), Gavin Herdman (Tuba) and the Nigel Bateman (Drums). These guys are all stand-out performers and have been making brass music for their lifetimes, all over the country.

“DRB perform any music that has the right feel and excites them, says Bruce.  “So nothing is safe from the ravages of 2nd line raucousness. In recent times we have created an original sound largely written by Hamish with street jams and songs like Better Second Line and Shake dat Booty.”

The Damn Raucous Brass show is an exuberant expression of all eight musicians’ collective musical experience and passion for the 2nd line brass bands energy and audience participation, massive fun, danceable and memorable.

If you want to catch up on 2nd Line music check out these bands: Young Blood Brass Band, Lucky Chops, Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Hot 8 Brass Band. Also their Facebook page is worth a good look. 

DRB are performing this Saturday, 21st at the Lucky Bar Coffee and Kitchen, 53 Wilson Street. Show starts at 9-ish pm. Bruce recommends, “You could book in for dinner earlier and stay for a good raucous time. I sure would.”
