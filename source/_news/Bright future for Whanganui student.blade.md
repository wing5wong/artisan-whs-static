<p>As Faith Chadfield neared the end of Year 13, the question of what she would do once she finished school was still very much up in the air.</p>
<p>As her final days of school approached, the bright 18-year-old found herself without the crucial NCEA Level 2 qualification, and seemingly without a great deal of options.</p>
<p>"I was really confused in my last couple of years at school, because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I felt really lost. I wasn't passing anything...it wasn't a good feeling," Faith said.</p>
<p>Six months down the track, and Faith is moving forward with a goal and a plan, thanks to a free training programme delivered by Whanganui-based tertiary education provider Training For You.</p>
<p>The Whānau Positive Futures programme is a free, 80-credit programme which leads to the achievement of NCEA Level 2, and has a vocational pathway in the social and community services sector. A strong component of the programme is early childhood education - an area that Faith has discovered is right up her street.</p>
<p>The eldest of three daughters, Faith has realised that caring for younger ones is her strength.</p>
<p>"I've got a lot of younger cousins that I take care of, and I find it so easy, so that made me think, 'maybe there is something there?'."</p>
<p>The Whānau Positive Futures programme runs for 36 weeks, with classes held Tuesday-Thursday. The programme has five modules made up of unit standards that provide knowledge and skills that can be a stepping stone to further education. Towards the end of the programme, students are given the opportunity for work placements which help them get a feel for the work they are thinking about doing.</p>
<p>Faith is looking forward to a placement in an early childhood setting. "I've finally decided what I want to do. I want to be a kindergarten teacher."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Faith plans to continue her study to gain more qualifications. The future is indeed looking bright for this positive young woman.</p>
<p>"It feels good having a goal to work towards. I just 100% want to work with children," Faith said.</p>
<p>For parents of other teenagers who are struggling at school or just undecided in their direction, there are alternative options for gaining the NCEA Level 2 qualification. Training For You is hosting a series of information evenings about their on-campus programmes in the areas of health and education, administration and technology, and working with children: 4-6 pm, June 13 and 20, and July 11 at 148 Ingestre Street.</p>
