<p>It was touch and go on the rough waters of Lake Wiritoa, but the Wanganui Water Ski Club got through their entire Gold Star tournament for 44 top skiers on the weekend.</p>
<p>Using the fine conditions on Friday evening and Saturday morning, organisers swiftly worked through the two rounds of jumps competition as well as one round and a third of the slalom events, followed by the tricks competition that evening.</p>
<p>It meant come yesterday and the weather bomb which hit around the early afternoon that the competitors only had a small amount of the second rounds of tricks and slalom to complete their competition.</p>
<p>Club president Ron Bakker said some of the top skiers still decided not to compete in the rough conditions on Sunday morning, saving themselves for the upcoming Asian and Oceania Championships in Auckland this coming weekend.</p>
<p>WHS student <strong>Lily Meade</strong>, expected to among the top juniors in Auckland, was among them, although the teenager was consistent in her other divisions.</p>
<p>"She jumped pretty well over 30m in each round," Bakker said.</p>
<p>The best of the locals were Nick Bakker (former WHS student) and Simon Meade, with Bakker winning the slalom open title ahead of Waikato's Connor McCracken and United States-based Alex King.</p>
<p>Meade won the slalom for the Senior Men's 1 (aged 35-45).</p>
<p>His son Brent Meade (former WHS student) was also strong in the jumps, putting up two leaps just under 40m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The star of the weekend was Wellington's John Gibbons, who matched his national record in trick for Senior Men's 2 (45-55), while also winning the slalom in what was the largest division for entries.</p>
<p>"We find the biggest fields anywhere in the country are Senior Men 2," said Ron Bakker.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of competition amongst the senior ranks.</p>
<p>"It's one of those sports where you can ski right through [the ages].</p>
<p>For example, local Trevor Fowler continues to compete in Senior Men's 4 (65 plus) at the age of 73.</p>
<p>Watching the event, while also working the cellphone to help a group of lost Korean skiers find their way around Auckland ahead of this weekend's international event, Glen Williams said while young competitors like Brent Meade have to fit training around jobs or school, the veterans are at a place in life where taking part is easier.</p>
<p>"The 45-55 age group in men's slalom is very competitive, not just in New Zealand but worldwide. It's guys that have got free time."</p>
<p>As New Zealand Tournament Water Ski Association's director of coaching, Williams said Lake Wiritoa, which has hosted the nationals, is a perfect training ground with its deep water, suiting slalom and jumps.</p>
<p>"You get a lot of personal bests here.</p>
<p>"Obviously it's windy in Whanganui, [but] the way it is with the trees, it protects it from the westerly.</p>
<p>"Learning trick takes the most time. It's easier to learn when you're young.</p>
<p>"You don't have to have a slalom course [sized lake] or a jumps course."</p>
<p>Many skiers blanch at developing their jumps skills, but Williams said that discipline is the one of the three that New Zealanders should develop further as it is easier to train in the colder weather conditions in this country.</p>
<p>"In terms of the world stage, we have more chance of doing better in the jump than slalom or trick."</p>
<p>The Asian &amp; Oceania Waterski Championships will host competitors from over 25 countries in Auckland this weekend.</p>
