Jax Hair Studio has been operating a successful hairdressing salon in Ridgway Street for about 28 years.   It was suggested to Jacqui by another well respected Aramoho business woman and mentor that she should open a salon in the busy little river view suburb. 

Jacqui had always thought the little house on the corner of Somme Parade and Spier Street had potential and when it went up for sale she thought it would be the perfect spot. 

A year in the making and COVID in amongst it, all the renovations are now complete.  The new space boasts a beautiful relaxed atmosphere with 5 work stations overlooking the Whanganui River with sight of the trains and the Waimarie close by.  The ambience couldn’t be better.

The salon is an extension of their city salon offering all of the same professional hairdressing services for both ladies and men including hair extension and dreadlock specialised services.

Jax supports the “Mission” of their product supplier “Delorenzo” to provide the best quality, natural based haircare and services in an environmentally responsible way.

All the staff attended the sustainability course at the resource recovery centre and now recycles or composts almost everything they can and even make some of their cleaning products.

Opening hours
• Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm
• Late night Wednesday to 7pm “ensomme”
• Late night Tuesday & Thursday  to 8pm “Ridgway Street”
• Saturday from 9am to 3pm

Millie, Katelyn and Autumn welcome all existing and new clientele.

You can contact them on 343 1225 or Facebook.
