Last week our Director of International Students, Natasha McKee, had the opportunity to connect with several exhibitors at  the Schools International Education Business Association (SIEBA) conference in Auckland, including representatives from the University of Waikato. Collaborating with tertiary providers enables us to work towards seamless pathways for our long-term international students into higher education.
