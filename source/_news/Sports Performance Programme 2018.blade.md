<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> News Release<br /></span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whanganui High School Performance Pathway 2018<br /></span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Whanganui High school has been in the process of developing a sport pathway for the last 18 months.</p>
<p>We have now reached the point where we are ready to launch a performance pathway to compliment this.</p>
<p>It will target a selected range of students and offer some more advanced training and support that will allow them to reach the next level of their athletic performance and their associated team sport / support sport activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The performance group will be limited to a maximum of 30 places initially and will be chosen in conjunction with sport staff and coaches. Participants will come from identified sports and activities that fit with the sport development pathway model and level one sport priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will be a best practise, leading edge model for athlete development and will align with best practise currently in place within sports codes and national programmes, and in coaching and personal development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be done in conjunction with codes, coaches, volunteers, and support staff to ensure continuity and improvement of the programme and the associated codes.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will it include?</span></strong></p>
<p>1.<strong>&nbsp;Mentoring</strong>&nbsp;- All athletes in the programme will have assistance with goal setting and developing a yearly performance plan.</p>
<p>2.<strong>&nbsp;Leadership / personal development</strong>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Part of the programme will involve development and coaching around taking leadership roles within teams and sport at WHS.</p>
<p>3.<strong>&nbsp;Physical preparation &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>All athletes will have access to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>specialist physical development and conditioning sessions and programmes.</p>
<p>4.<strong>&nbsp;Support &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The school will provide support to ensure students can maintain a work, sport, life balance throughout the year.</p>
<p>5.<strong>&nbsp;Lifestyle / Nutrition &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Advice and assistance will be available with nutrition and lifestyle management</p>
<p><strong>More information on this exciting opportunity for 2018 will be available soon!</strong></p>
