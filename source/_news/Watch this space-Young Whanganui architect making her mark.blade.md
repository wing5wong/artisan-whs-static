<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big wide world</strong></p>
<p>When Darni Struijck decided to pursue a career in architecture, she was told it was a "male's profession" that was "difficult to hack".</p>
<p>Now she is a graduate, working for Dalgleish Architects in Whanganui and taking sole charge of projects from start to finish.</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student said it was a hard road to get to where she is now but working with clients to design beautiful spaces made the struggle worthwhile.</p>
<p>During high school, Ms Struijck tried as many subjects as she could.</p>
<p>"My mum told me to dip my toes in everything to figure out what I liked and eliminate what didn't click with me ... and it worked.</p>
<p>"I didn't know if I definitely wanted to get into architecture when I left school so I took a gap year and travelled to Holland, where I was born.</p>
<p>"Visiting all the European architecture and falling in love with Holland's minimalist style solidified my choice."</p>
<p>She returned to New Zealand to study for a bachelor of architecture at Victoria University in Wellington. After she completed the three-year course, she took on two years of a masters degree.</p>
<p>"Not everyone completes a masters but it does open doors because it's a prerequisite to becoming a registered architect. That basically means you can work higher up the ranks and start your own architecture business."</p>
<p>The 27-year-old completed her masters part-time from Whanganui while gaining work experience with Dalgleish.</p>
<p>"Making that leap from uni to employment can be really hard because employers like to take on people with experience, so working part-time before I finished studying gave me a big advantage," Ms Struijck said.</p>
<p>Two months before completing her masters she moved back to Wellington to focus on her final thesis, and was offered a job there with a large commercial architecture firm, Jasmax.</p>
<p>"I worked there for 1 years. It was a good experience because I wanted to grow and learn from different companies and different clients.</p>
<p>"Midway through last year my old boss, Craig Dalgleish, contacted me to offer me a graduate position and, at that point, I was pretty keen to come back to Whanganui and work for a smaller firm."</p>
<p>Ms Struijck is happily back on home turf, saying: "I love my job - especially developing client relationships and talking about their space and getting to understand what works for them."</p>
