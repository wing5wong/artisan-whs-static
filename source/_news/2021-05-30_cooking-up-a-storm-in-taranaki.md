Three excited students and I left Whanganui at 5am on Sunday morning heading to the NZ Chef’s Regional Competition 2021 which was held in New Plymouth at the Western Institute of Technology at Taranaki.

Two took part in ‘Hot Kitchen’ which was in front of a live audience. Kaylah cooked pumpkin soup and Jaydene cooked her broccoli dish for NSSCC (National Secondary School Culinary Challenge).

All three students took part in ‘Setting out Statics’. Kaylah in Creative Cupcake and both Joshua and Jaydene in the Fonterra Cheesecake classes.

Results:
* Keylah Bouzaid-Hoggarth  
GOLD Medal & Class Winner - Creative Cupcake “Serengeti High Life”  
GOLD Medal & Class Winner – “Natural Fare Soup”

* Joshua Christall  
GOLD Medal & Class Winner - Cheesecake “Go Mango Go”

* Jaydene  Bullock  
SILVER Medal - Cheesecake “Hearty Blueberry Cheesecake”  
SILVER Medal - NSSCC “Broccoli Daze”

It was a very successful day and the class winners received a $100 voucher as well as a Gold Medal.

Congratulations to you all!
