<p><span>SIX OF THE BEST: Wanganui swimmers (from left) Shannon Schimanski (WCS), Grace Hogan, Alex Forlong, Sarya Lower, Jaimee Bridger, Merle Goepfert (all WHS) made their presence felt at the New Zealand Secondary Schools Swimming Championships <span>at the Te Rapa waterworld&nbsp;</span>in Hamilton at the weekend.</span></p>
<p>Sarya Lower was the most successful of the WHS swimmers with three silver medals in the 14-year-old 50m and 100m freestyle and the 200m individual medley. She also had a fourth in the 100m breaststroke, a sixth in the 50m butterfly, seventh in the 50m breaststroke and eighth in the 50m backstroke.</p>
<p>German exchange student Merle Goepfert (15) and Alex Forlong (14) gained individual finalist certificates for their 6th and 8th placings in the 50m breaststroke (Goepfert) and 200m butterfly (Forlong).</p>
<p>The other two WHS students, Grace Hogan (15) and Jaimee Bridger (14) both had an outstanding competition with Hogan recording personal bests in all five of her individual races and Bridger posting four out of five personal bests.</p>
<p>The two WHS relay teams both placed eighth to ensure that every team member came away with at least one finalist certificate.</p>
<p><span>Unfortunatley the <span>competition clashed with senior school exams at WHS, so only Year 9 and 10 swimmers could attend.</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
