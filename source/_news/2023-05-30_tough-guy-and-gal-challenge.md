Our International Students were well-represented at the Tough Guy and Gal Challenge held in Wainuiomata on Friday.  The 6 km event included running through water trails; crawling under barbwire obstacles; clambering through tunnels; wading through swamp crossings and lots of mud!..  Did we mention the water was cold 🥶? Not to be outdone by students, Deputy Principal Jenny Langrish and Outdoor Education teacher Josh Barnett entered the teachers’ race.  Mr Barnett won the the teaches’ race and also came 5th overall with 1,150 participants 👏
