<p>ON TARGET: Striker Jordan Gilmore lines up the Collegiate goalie to help WHS cruise home 7-1 last week.</p>
<p>Our 1st XI team had a convincing win over Collegiate in their inter school fixture last Wednesday at WHS winning 7-1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some great attacking play from the WHS team saw 6 of the players score goals with Nasr Ghamri scoring two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First half saw&nbsp;Jordan Gilmore,&nbsp;Richard Saunders and Josh Parker score and in the second half&nbsp;Nasr Ghamri scored two with&nbsp;Reuben Warburton and&nbsp;Luke Lambe scoring one each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coach Steve Kerfoot was extremely happy with his sides effort. "Whilst we still have got a way to go in terms of strategy against strong teams we have great depth in most positions within the team" Kerfoot said. "I was able to put all 18 players on throughout the game and the standard never changed, which shows promising depth for our&nbsp;week long tournament we&nbsp;are working towards in September this year".&nbsp;</p>
<p>This team practices twice a week but only plays together in inter school fixtures and for the week long&nbsp;tournament in September as they all play for different clubs on Saturdays. Collegiate was their 2nd outing of the season,&nbsp;with Hutt Valley High inter school coming up on June 23rd at WHS.</p>
