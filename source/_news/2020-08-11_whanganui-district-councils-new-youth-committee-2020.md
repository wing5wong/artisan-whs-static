Wowweee check out our new Youth Committee! 👏🏼🔥

Was awesome to have 9 new members sworn in by Mayor Hamish McDouall on Monday.

Congrats to Louis Devine & **Charlotte Hardy** - our new co-chairs! And a teary farewell to Ariana Cronshaw 😭

We exist to take YOUR views to the council. That means we can do our job/mahi if YOU speak up and contribute..

What do you think the youth of Whanganui need?

If you know any of these wonderful humans, chat/korero with them! @ Whanganui District Council
