**Grace Swanston, a student at Whanganui High School, has won Fine Arts Whanganui's 2020 Young Artists Scholarship.**

Craig Hooker, chairman of Fine Arts Whanganui, said the scholarship was part of a commitment to foster interest in the region's young artists and to help them progress artistically. Aside from the $1000 cash prize, an important element was the opportunity to hold a solo exhibition in the Fine Arts Whanganui Gallery. **Grace Swanston will hold her solo exhibition in the gallery, from June 24 to July 15.**

The judges, Sietske Jansma and Anique Jayasinghe, also awarded three **distinction certificates** to Ani Latus, Stella Howe (Whanganui Girls' College) and **Zoe Bracegirdle, (Whanganui High School). Zoe Bracegirdle also won the People's Choice Award** sponsored by Renata's Art & Framing.
