<h4><strong>A team of four year 11 students from Whanganui High School will be performing their five minutes scene from A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream at the Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe Centre New Zealand (SGCNZ) festival in Wellington over Queen&rsquo;s Birthday weekend.</strong></h4>

<p><strong>The team consists of Simmone Sarup, Timara Wallace, Jayden Grant and Lachlan Baxter.</strong>&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">Lachlan says &ldquo;most of the planning and direction was done by Simmone and Timara.&rdquo; Lachlan enjoyed the experience and plans to continue doing drama at school.<br /></span></p>
