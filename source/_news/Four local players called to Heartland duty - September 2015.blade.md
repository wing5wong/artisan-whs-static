<p>The good news continued for four members of the HYRC Series-winning Wanganui Under-20s after they were named in the New Zealand Heartland XV to attend the Jock Hobbs Memorial Under-19 competition in Taupo this month.</p>
<p>Former WHS students <strong>Joe Edwards</strong><span>&nbsp;(Kaierau) and </span><strong>Dominic Broadhead</strong><span>&nbsp;(Kaierau);&nbsp;</span>Gabriel Hakaraia (Ruapehu), Taylor Transom (Taihape)&nbsp;received the call-up to the 25-man team, which consists of U19 representatives from all 12 Heartland unions.</p>
<p>The team will compete in the second-tier Michael Jones Trophy competition in Taupo.</p>
<p>The national tournament consists of 16 teams, coming from the 14 ITM Cup unions, plus one other provincial team from a major centre and the Heartland XV.</p>
<p>Several unions hold mini-tournaments within their various Super Rugby regions to decide which teams will be seeded in either the Top8 (Graham Mourie Cup) grade or the Bottom 8 (Michael Jones Trophy).</p>
<p>Last year, Heartland surprised everyone, as following a very short preparation time together they beat Tasman 25-15, lost to Southland 48-38, then defeated Hawke's Bay 26-5 to finish third in their grade.</p>
<p>The Wanganui players selected for that team were Zyon Hekenui (Ruapehu), Mitchell Overton (Taihape), James Brett (Hunterville) and former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Kameli Kuruyabaki</strong> (then Pirates, now Kaierau).</p>
<p>The 2015 tournament will be from September 28 to October 2.</p>
