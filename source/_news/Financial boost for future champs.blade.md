<p class="element element-paragraph">The latest grants for the Mitre 10 Mega Future Champions Trust were presented at the Whanganui Secondary School Sports Awards at Cullinane College last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Future Champions Trust aims to give Whanganui people and businesses an opportunity to support our talented sporting youth with a hand up to reach their full potential at international level.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The recipients were:</strong></p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Fergus Smith (Golf): Selected to attend the University of Iowa in the United States to assist with and enhance his golfing career.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The athletes and their representatives were invited to attend the function, where the trust and its supporters acknowledged their achievements to date, and wished them well for their future endeavours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Future Champions Trust has been operating for five years and has granted $37,000 towards high achieving individual Whanganui youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Funding rounds are held twice annually at the end of March and September and this time around, the trust received generous donations from Mitre 10 Mega Whanganui and a variety of other businesses and individuals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Trust chairwoman Philippa Baker-Hogan encouraged athletes interested in applying for the next round in March 2018 to visit the website to assess the criteria for the fund, and download an application form.</p>
