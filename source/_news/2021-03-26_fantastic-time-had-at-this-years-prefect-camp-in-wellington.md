On the 18th of March, the Whanganui High School Prefect team headed down to Wellington for
an overnight stay full of fun, team-bonding activities and the exciting “Amazing Race”. 

The prefect camp was planned and ran primarily by the four heads of school, Sophia, Blair, Lilee and Troy. The prefect camp aims to build up trust and create strong relationships between all of the prefects. 

Seven teams, consisting of six student teams and one teacher team were sent off around Wellington in pursuit of taking home this year's, “Amazing Race Champions” title. The
teams would attempt to solve riddles to locate one of the seven major locations while picking up bonus points on the way throughout the competition. These bonus points were awarded for
completing extra tasks such as, “Find a local from Whanganui”, or “Beat three locals in a
running race”. After some amazing weather and a huge effort by everyone, this year's title went
to the Red Team, composed of Flynn, Max, Tayla, Molly and Kevin with a whopping 249 points.

A huge thank you to Mrs Langrish, the teachers, and the amazing prefects for the incredible
work and participation put into the event.
