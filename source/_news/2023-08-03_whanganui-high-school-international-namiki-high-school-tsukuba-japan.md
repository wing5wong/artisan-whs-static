On the 3rd August, we welcomed 21 students from Namiki High School, Tsukuba, Japan. The group is here for 9 days and will join buddy classes, ESOL lessons, PE and [](<>)Maori cultural lessons while here. The students also delivered individual presentations on a Japanese cultural aspect to some of our language classes today. We hope you all enjoy your stay at Whanganui High School.
