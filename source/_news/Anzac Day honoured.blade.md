<p data-bind="text: $data">Last Wednesday, Whanganui Girls&rsquo; College came together in a special assembly to honour the Anzacs, in particular those who once attended the school.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Organised by the Old Girls Association, there were representatives of the RSA, including its Women&rsquo;s Section and a representative of the current serving military in the service.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The large display cabinet in the school foyer was provided and is maintained by the Old Girls Association and houses a complex tableau representing the part women played in the world wars.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The service was held on April 10 because Anzac Day falls in the school holidays.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">As the girls entered the hall, they each picked up a poppy. Proceedings began with the National Anthem and the New Zealand flag was kept on display on stage throughout the service.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Head girl Nikita McDonald spoke about Anzac and explained what would happen after the service.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>Guest speaker and former Whanganui High School student was Major Tim Easton from the NZ Army 5/7 RNZIR. He gave his story, about how he has made the army his part-time career, including his postings in Afghanistan and Egypt.</strong></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He made mention of former students of the school who served during the wars and urged his audience to view the display cabinet in the foyer.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He mentioned Elsie Green, a nurse in WWI.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than 100 years ago now, so I thought I&rsquo;d share a story about a person who was deployed to Afghanistan with me in 2011.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He told the story of Captain Megan, being careful to change her name for the story.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;When we were deployed over there she was 21 and had just come out of her senior nursing training.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He saw comparisons with Megan and Elsie. Her job was to look after the soldiers, but also to help the local community and serve in their &ldquo;hospital&rdquo;.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;It was a building with some 1960s equipment in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She also worked in a local orphanage. She later deployed to Iraq in 2015 in a similar role and later married an army officer and became a mother. She has a story, while not exactly the same as Elsie 100 years ago, follows a similar pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He added that while we remember Anzac forces of all those years ago, it is also important to remember there are armed forces personnel still serving overseas.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">After the Last Post, the flag was removed and carried through to the foyer and laid on a table. There the girls placed their poppies.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Megan Wallbutton, president of the Whanganui Girls&rsquo; College Old Girls Association and treasurer of the Wanganui RSA Women&rsquo;s Section, says it&rsquo;s the first time the Old Girls have really been recognised.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We did it this year to recognise Old Girls who had served overseas in the First and Second World Wars, because it had never been done before. We decided, months back, so we took it to Tania [King, school principal] and she thought it was a good idea. It just grew and I started working on the Girls&rsquo; history over Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The event ended with an afternoon tea.</p>
