<p class="element element-paragraph">A former Whanganui High School student discovered the "art of nursing" while volunteering on board the world's largest civilian hospital ship in West Africa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Joining a crew of 450 volunteers, Deborah Adesanya spent her 2017 New Year on board Africa Mercy docked in Benin where she spent 20 weeks nursing to help provide free surgery to children in desperate need.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She described the experience as "confronting" and "surreal".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In New Zealand if you have a lump, you get it seen and it gets treated. Over there children were walking in with massive tumours the size of water melons - it was really confronting," Ms Adesanya said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For the 26 year-old it an experience close to heart and an opportunity to pay it forward.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Adesanya was born in Nigeria, only a few hours drive from Benin, and emigrated to New Zealand when she was 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She lived in Rotorua for a short stint before moving to Whanganui with her family when she was 15.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After finishing high school she moved to Auckland to complete her bachelor of nursing degree in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As she was driving home on the Auckland motorway she spotted a billboard advertising Africa Mercy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Deep inside it felt like it was something I was meant to do so I went home and did a bit of researching and a few months later I was on board docking into Benin."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it wasn't all smooth sailing and there were moments that almost broke her.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She remembered a little boy who got rushed in after he had fallen into a camp fire.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He had excessive jaw and mouth injuries and horrific burns, his whole body needed a cast. This kid was incredibly resilient but the treatment was intense. He started screaming, speaking Yoruba, but I couldn't understand it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said most people over there could speak French so they had a French translator who spoke to the father and the father translated to his son in their local language.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The intensity just broke me and I had to hand the tube over and leave the room. I just went to a corner and cried and cried."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Adesanya said when she came back into the room the boy didn't hold a grudge but was so thankful.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Even if we couldn't fix them, they were so grateful...it was amazing how you formed this connection with the patients through the language barriers."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said she was able to push through those confronting times because she started to see that what they were doing was helping and they were making a difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">"Being over there it took me back to the art of nursing. You were connecting with the patients and it became more than just a job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was no sense of entitlement over there. In New Zealand it's not intentional but there is a sense of entitlement like I should have this...it really made me see that first world problems are a real thing," Ms Adesanya said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said coming back to the same job in New Zealand at Starship Hospital in Auckland felt "pretty bizarre".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sometimes it feels like that trip to West Africa was a dream."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But she brings her surreal experience with her to work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Having that connection with patients is important and being over there it really did open up my world view, all the extra clothing we took over we gave away...you learn to let go of material things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Looking into the future, Ms Adesanya said aims to save up to do more volunteer work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I would definitely recommend it, and they aren't just looking for nurses but canteen staff, cleaners, doctors, all sorts."</p>
