<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School students had the chance to learn about Chinese language and culture during Chinese Language Week celebrations.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Led by the school's Chinese language teacher, Beck Ding, students were invited to take part in a range of Chinese-themed activities last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During school breaks students could watch Chinese films (popcorn included), take part in Chinese quizzes and watch kung fu demonstrations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Ding also taught his language students skills such as writing their names in Chinese calligraphy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said Whanganui High School had about 100 students learning Chinese.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's growing all the time - it's a subject that is definitely increasing in popularity."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The school also has two Mandarin language assistants who take Chinese classes in local primary schools.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're trying to build a base so that students start learning the language early."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Ding said there were plans to take a group of Whanganui High School students to China next year for a cultural exchange.</p>
