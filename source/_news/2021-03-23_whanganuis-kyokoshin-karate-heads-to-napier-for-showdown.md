Nine fighters from a local dojo are heading to Napier this weekend to compete in the New Zealand Match Fight Championships.


Kyokoshin Karate, based on St Hill St, haven't competed in an event since September 2019 due to all the complications with Covid-19.


Sensei Richard Hood said they were all itching to get back into action after the long lay-off.


"Instead of a normal tournament where you fight three or four times, these are specific one-off match-ups.

"Full contact, no gloves or headgear. The young ones will have protection after some rule changes."


Hood was meant to be in the main event, but an out of training injury has forced him to be replaced by Brian Alderton.


Tracey Boswell is one of New Zealand's longest-serving female fighters and **17 year old Jake Hood** will take on a two opponents on the day, **fighting two 30-year-olds** who have more than 30kg in weight over the teenager.


Other than the three aforementioned, the remaining six fighters are all making their debuts.


"They're all excited to get out there after such a long time without any competitions," added Hood.
