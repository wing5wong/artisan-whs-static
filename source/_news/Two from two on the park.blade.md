<p><span>WINNING RUN: The Wanganui U18 team make it two from two representative match-ups after first beating Thames Valley 22-18 then Horwhenua-Kapiti 46-14 last Saturday.</span></p>
<p>The Air Chathams U18 Wanganui representative rugby team has continued its winning way with a decisive 46-14 win over Horowhenua-Kapiti at the weekend.</p>
<p>Coach Jerome McCrea set himself the task of improving the side's conditioning and especially the set piece, as Wanganui only narrowly held out Thames Valley at Spriggens Park to kick off the representative season.</p>
<p>Wanganui held on 22-18 after giving away a couple of tighthead scrums at crucial stages of the second half when the visitors were coming back at them.</p>
<p>McCrea had obviously weaved some magic during the week to set the ball rolling for a successful season.</p>
<p>On Saturday against Horowhenua-Kapiti at Spriggens Park, the Wanganui side gelled running in eight tries with star fullback Adam Boult scoring three and Opetini Dryden two.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sheldon Pakinga&nbsp;</strong>(WHS student), Joey Raukawa and Jospeh Soloate each chipped in with a try apiece, while <strong>Mitchell Millar&nbsp;</strong>(WHS student) slotted two conversions and <strong>Pakinga</strong> one.</p>
<p>The lads travel to Levin this weekend and thenget flown to Gisborne by their new sponsors the following week.</p>
