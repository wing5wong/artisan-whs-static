<p>A former Whanganui woman is preparing for the biggest night of her life.</p>
<p>Former WHS student Jessica Tyson, who was born and raised in Whanganui and is of Atihaunui-a-Paparangi descent, will compete in the Miss World New Zealand pageant on June 4 at Sky City in Auckland.</p>
<p>Last year, Miss Tyson won the Miss East Auckland crown, giving her entry to Miss World New Zealand.</p>
<p>"So far I am less than two weeks away from the final of the national pageant. It has been a very busy and challenging experience since the pageant began in February."</p>
<p>Miss World contestants are expected to be more than beauty queens - they are required to take part in a variety of events including fundraising for charities.</p>
<p>Since February Miss Tyson has organised and hosted her own charity fashion show, taken part in pageant rehearsals every weekend, taken part in pre-judging, photoshoots and fitness bootcamps.</p>
<p>"Basically the amount of work involved has been like having another full-time job," Miss Tyson said.</p>
<p>She trained as a journalist at AUT and works on the news desk at TVNZ.</p>
<p>Jessica is no stranger to competing on the big stage. Whanganui people may remember Jessica who, as a 15-year-old, won the Miss Teen South Pacific and Miss Teen World Supermodel competitions.</p>
<p>"Ever since then it's been a goal of mine to win Miss World New Zealand," Jessica said.</p>
