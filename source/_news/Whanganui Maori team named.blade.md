<p>At least three former WHS students are named in the Whanganui Maori team for 2017.&nbsp;<br /><span>Mikaere Penetito,&nbsp;<span>Keanu Puki-Kaa and&nbsp;<span>Jack Hodges.</span></span></span></p>
<p>A strong Whanganui Maori squad has been named to tackle the annual Te Tini A Maui Rugby Tournament to be played in Masterton next month.</p>
<p>The 22-man squad features a solid mix of current Steelform Whanganui Heartland players, more than useful senior premier grade men and few older wiser heads thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Whanganui hosted last year's tournament where the homeside finished second to a strong Wellington side. It was the first time in 10 years the tournament had been hosted outside Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Many of last year's quad return this season, including 2016 Mitre 10 Heartland Championship Player of the Year, Te Rangatira Waitokia.</p>
<p>Last season the team also claimed the prestigious 120-year-old Tuera Shield after upsetting Taranaki Maori 48-12 on home soil at Cooks Gardens for what was believed to be the first time since 1989.</p>
<p>Coach Vaan Rauhina is again back in the frame with Justin Lock named as his deputy.</p>
<p>The team manager is Joe Fazakerley.</p>
<p>Training sessions will be held at Spriggens Park on Wednesday, March 1 at 6.30pm and Wednesday, March 5 at 3pm.</p>
<p>The tournament in Masterton is set down for March 11 and 12.</p>
<p>The squad is:<br />Roman Tutauha - Captain<br />Jamie Hughes<br />Gabriel Hakaraia<br />Tawhio Gupwell<br />Troy Brown<br />Christian Hawira<br />Dane Whale<br />Tremaine Gilbert<br />Jaye Flaws<br />Josh Hirini<br />Mikaere Penetito<br />Sean Van Der Lubbe<br />Kane Tamou<br />Keanu Puki-Kaa<br />Cody Hemi<br />Steelie Koro<br />Kieran Hussey<br />Sam Madams<br />Jack Hodges<br />Isaiah Hooper<br />James Forsyth<br />Te Rangatira Waitokia</p>
