❄️✨ Snow, sheep, and smiles! ✨❄️

Whanganui High School, together with Whanganui Girls' College , are excited to be hosting a group of students from Waseda Jitsugyo High School, Tokyo, Japan, for two weeks.

Today’s adventure took us from Polson’s Farm on the Parapara Road — where students saw sheep shearing up close — to the heights of the Sky Waka at Whakapapa, finishing with an afternoon of sledding at Happy Valley. 🐑🛷⛰️

A day full of Kiwi experiences and fun memories! 🇯🇵🤝🇳🇿
