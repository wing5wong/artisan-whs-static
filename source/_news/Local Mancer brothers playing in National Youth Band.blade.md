<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Bradley and Jacob Mancer are both in the National Youth Brass Band and will be playing in the Band&rsquo;s tour in New Plymouth, Whanganui, Palmerston North and Wellington between January 25 and 28. Both are now at University but qualify for the Youth Band, being under the age of 23. They are not the only set of brothers, according to organiser Captain Mike Ford. There are three brothers originally from Whakatane.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The National Youth Brass Band is an eclectic mix of talented young New Zealanders up to age 22, who perform to an amazingly high standard. They are chosen by audition from applicants all over New Zealand. Mike Ford says &ldquo;Their enthusiasm is infectious, making the performance an inspiring and musically satisfying experience.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The group come together for a five day training course which includes section work with some of New Zealand and Australia&rsquo;s finest musicians. This year the course is being held in New Plymouth, thus the tour from Taranaki to Wellington. Last year it was based in the Hawkes Bay, and in 2015 it was the top of the South Island and in 2014, the bottom of the South.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">It is an achievement to be selected. There is no minimum age, with the youngest Mike can remember being only 13; there is a 14 year old this year. You need to audition every year but some members make it for a number of years and for this concert, four key players will be giving solos. This includes Bradley Mancer.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The Band will be under the baton of David Bremner (principal trombone NZSO, conductor of Wellington Brass, the champion band of New Zealand). The concert is titled &ldquo;Structured: De/constructed" and features a mix of classical and modern brass band music. The first half includes classical works, such as Phillip Wilby&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paganini Variations&rdquo; and Denis Wright&rsquo;s arrangement of Brahms' &ldquo;Academic Festival Overture&rdquo;. The second half is lively and upbeat, featuring modern brass band and Jazz music. Mike says &ldquo;This is an exciting range of music that will appeal to all ages.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The concert is at the Prince Edward auditorium at Collegiate. It will be from 7.30 to 9.30pm. Tickets cost $20 for adults, $15 for seniors and students and free for children under 12. Tickets can be purchased through eventfinda.co.nz or at the door.</span></span></p>
