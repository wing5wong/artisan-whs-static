Whanganui High School Debating Championships

On Sunday 1st September the Manawatu-Whanganui branch of the New Zealand Schools Debating Championships were held. WHS entered one Junior team. Vera Horvath (Year 9), Olivia Campbell (Year 9) and Campbell Wilkins (Year 9) made us proud. They won all three of their initial rounds. They were entered in the final and they won this too!  Olivia Campbell was also Most Promising Debating Newcomer.

We look forward to their continued success as fantastic debaters!
