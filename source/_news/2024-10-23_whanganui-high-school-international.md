"🌏 This week, our Whanganui delegation had the privilege of presenting at the New Zealand Embassy in Tokyo to an audience of over 35 agents and school representatives! 🎤🌸 A standout moment was when Whanganui High School's Director of International Students, Natasha McKee delivered her presentation in  Japanese, giving us a leading edge in connecting with the audience🇯🇵🎓 This event not only strengthened our existing relationships with agents and schools, but also opened doors to new connections, paving the way for future international students to choose Whanganui as their study destination. #WhanganuiEducation #StudyinNZ #InternationalStudents #WhanganuiHighSchool"
