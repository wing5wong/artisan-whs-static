A message from Mr McAllen, Principal, on behalf of our school Public Health Nurses:

Parents and caregivers of Year 9 students would have received in the beginning of Term One, a letter by mail offering a health and wellbeing check by one of our Public Health Nurses (WDHB) based in the school.  If you did not receive a letter, please contact Public Health on 06 348 1775 for further information.

The Public Health Nurse provides a confidential nurse-led clinic (Monday to Friday) via the Student Centre.  This provides all students with the opportunity to seek focused health advice and support.
