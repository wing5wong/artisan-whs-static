<p>Checking out the Wanganui Water Ski Club's new support boat are national under 17 champion WHS student Lily Meade, Trevor Fowler and Molly Deroles.</p>
<p>Whether following behind the action or being there to pick up fallen skiers in the drink, the Wanganui Water Ski Club will be doing it in style after the club launched their new Nautique 200 boat on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Club spokesman Simon Meade said the honours of the christening fell to life member Trevor Fowler - a stalwart of the sport and regular at Lake Wiritoa since the 1960's.</p>
<p>"[He] even built his own inboard powered boat 'Ski Venturer' back in the 1980's, at a time when outboards ruled the roost and the inboard was only just making its way onto the tournament water ski market."</p>
<p>Having a 5.7 litre Chevrolet engine making 300 horsepower was a major drawcard for the region's skiiers, Meade said.</p>
<p>The club will be hoping the same for this new Nautique joining their 'fleet'.</p>
<p>"As the club grew in numbers so did the realisation that having a dedicated boat owned by the club for members to use was essential, so in 2008 they purchased their first Nautique 196 ski boat, this was updated in 2013 with another 196," said Meade.</p>
<p>"Fast forward to November 2016 and the third boat to occupy the club garage has arrived.</p>
<p>"If you're a boating enthusiast then it's not hard to get excited when you lift the engine cover on this American manufactured ski boat, where you will find the latest in marine V8 power - 409 horse power to be precise - along with multipoint fuel injection and GPS based speed control."</p>
<p>Club president Ron Bakker described the Nautique as "the best tournament water ski boat on the planet, and the club is very lucky to have been in a position to purchase this three year old version".</p>
<p>As club says the cost was "somewhere over" the $120,000 mark for a near-new craft, they received some assistance from the Central Region Water Ski Association.</p>
<p>"With drivers and coaches all thrown in and club membership under $100, Bakker believes that the club is possibly the cheapest way to hit the water this summer."</p>
<p>Tow fees will start at $10 for juniors per ride, with club gear available if the person does not have their own.</p>
