<p>Revitalise Gym had to settle for second place in the race for Top Gym at the 2017 NABBA Manawatu/Wanganui/Taranaki championships at the Royal Opera House on Saturday.</p>
<p>All five members from Revitalise placed in their various divisions, with standouts Maureen Thomas and <strong>Daniel Foulkes</strong> going on to claim the overall titles of Ms Figure and <strong>Mr Physique</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>However, three of the five overall crowns went to representatives of City Fitness in Palmerston North, who therefore claimed the Top Gym prize, leaving Revitalise trainer Audrey O'Keefe feeling a little glum on behalf of her hard working crew.</p>
<p>"I'm super proud, but we didn't make it," she said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it had been a good competition for Revitalise with Thomas, <strong>Foulkes</strong>, Alison Richards, <strong>Shelby Moir and Michaela Sullenberger</strong> <strong>all qualifying for the NABBA NZ National Championships in Palmerston North this October.</strong></p>
<p>Other locals who qualified for nationals are Inspire's Mark Kaipo, City Gym's Tim Warren, and Ricky Taiaroa (Club Fitness).</p>
<p>Thomas, who has done well at national and world championship level, posed for the Figure 50+ division against three representatives in 40+ and Novice Figure Short.</p>
<p>She then went on to claim the Ms Figure crown when combined against the best from the large Novice Figure Tall section of six entries, including Inspire's Kirsty Harvey.</p>
<p>Richards competed in her Physique Women 50+ grade against the three Novice Figure Short and Tall entrants, which included Moir in the Novice Physique Tall.</p>
<p>After that, Richards joined <strong>Foulkes</strong> on stage for his first routine, as they have formed a Mixed Pairs combination.</p>
<p>O'Keefe praised Thomas and Richards for their unwavering commitment to the sport over the years, noting that with age comes discipline as they have been able to balance their lifestyles to stay ready for competition.</p>
<p>"It's not like any other spot where you train, you go home, you relax.</p>
<p>"It's 24-7. Nutrition is 80 per cent of it.</p>
<p>"It definitely becomes a way of life. It's impressive because you've got age against you.</p>
<p>"Gravity is not your friend."</p>
<p><strong>Foulkes</strong>, entering Open Physique Men Short, then posed against four competitors in their own Tall, 40+ and 50+ Open Physique grades, which included Taiaroa.</p>
<p><strong>Foulkes</strong>&nbsp;<strong>then</strong> <strong>went on to claim the Mr Physique title</strong> when matched up against the best from the Novice Physique sections.</p>
<p>"Daniel's first competition was a year ago," said O'Keefe.</p>
<p>"That's when we met each other, and he was doing things by himself.</p>
<p>"Being part of the team has helped his progress."</p>
<p>Foulkes works hard with his partner Moir, who herself lost 25kg getting ready for competition.</p>
<p>O'Keefe said Foulkes will be looking to improve on last year's efforts at nationals, where he won his class and then won over the crowd when he went after the overall title against the much taller Open Physique winners, having to settle for third.</p>
<p>He makes up for the lack of height with his performance and charisma, she said.</p>
<p>"He's kind of cheeky on stage."&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sullenberger</strong> was in perhaps the toughest grade of all, alongside eight competitors in the Novice Shape division, which included City Gym's Francesca Mackenzie.</p>
<p>O'Keefe said Novice Shape is perhaps the toughest division to judge as it often comes down to the officials personal preferences with regards to moves and looks, as well as muscle definition.</p>
<p><strong>Sullenberger</strong> and Mackenzie would finish <strong>third</strong> and fourth respectively, behind City Fitness' Avonlea Butcher and Levin's Jenny Jang.</p>
<p>"I had a few tears, because [Sullenberger's] got a little toddler. That was her first time competing after giving birth," said O'Keefe.</p>
<p>Warren claimed his Junior Men division while posing with a Teenage Men competitor, Kaipo was the Masters Athletic 40+ competitor and finished third in judging when matched up with the four other entrants in Athletic Tall and Short.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, Butcher went on to win the overall Ms Shape title, while her City Fitness gym mates Laurie Wells and Ben Hodgson won Ms Physique and Mr Athletic respectively.</p>
<p>Snap Fitness (Palmerston North) bodybuilder Drew Jackson won the Mr Manawatu Body - Board Shorts crown.</p>
<p>In choosing the Muscle Imaging best male and female performance, Auckland's Xiaojun Cao won best male, while Maria Dunlop (Rockbodz Taranaki) was best female.</p>
