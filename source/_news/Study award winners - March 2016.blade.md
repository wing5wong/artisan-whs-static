<p>All former WHS students; Alexandra James, Rebecca Todd, Rebekah O'Leary and Elena Morgan (pictured) are the latest recipients of the Wynne Costley study awards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The awards, which started 14 years ago, honour the memory of Wynne Costley, born Wynne Dunkleigh, who taught at Wanganui Technical and Wanganui Girls' College in the 1950s and 1960s. Wynne will also be remembered locally for her participation in drama.</p>
<p>In 2015 all four of these young women were studying at Victoria University. Alexandra James was in her second year of a double degree - Bachelor of Arts and Laws majoring in International Relations and Politics. Rebekah O'Leary was in her second year of a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Linguistics and Second Language Education and Rebecca Todd was in her third year of a Bachelor of Arts majoring in Anthropology and Religious Studies. Elena Morgan, at Victoria University's School of Music, was in her second year of a Bachelor of Music Performance with musicology, music theory and history, plus classical history - myth and mythologies.</p>
<p>Since the inception of the awards 45 young women have received either an award or a grant to assist with the costs of their study. Applications are now being sought for the 2016 awards. See the classified advertisements section of the March 23 edition for more detailed information. Prospective applicants should contact the secretary, Wanganui Federation of University Women Trust, telephone 345 4292.</p>
