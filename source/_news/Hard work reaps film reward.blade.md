<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world.</strong></p>
<p>Behind the scenes of a successful Whanganui film-maker is a movie in the making.</p>
<p>Former Whanganui High School student Abby Kingi has co-created a multimedia business in the River City against the odds.</p>
<p>In 2007, when Abby started her degree in design, video and animation, the film industry was dominated by movie monopolies and small multimedia businesses were virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>Now, contracted to work for TV3 and recently shooting videos in Cambodia, business is taking off for her company Lamp Studios - but it's been a journey.</p>
<p>After finishing high school and being told by her mother that a career in film was a "dreamer's job", Abby attempted a degree in social work.</p>
<p>"It wasn't long before I pulled out and applied for film school in Wellington ... but I didn't tell mum that," she said.</p>
<p>Abby's hubby and co-owner of Lamp Studios, Caleb Kingi, shared a similar passion for media. He enrolled to study computer graphic design at the Whanganui School of Design.</p>
<p>"I intended to go to film school in Wellington but when I went along with Caleb to his interview I ended up enrolling in a three-year graphics design course that specialised in video and animation," she said.</p>
<p>"Before I started studying, I had never even opened up a design software, let alone drawn a picture, but I'd always been interested in film." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Studying until three in the morning as well as working 20 hours was a harsh reality that Caleb and Abby had to endure for the next three years as they completed their course - "but we loved every minute of it".</p>
<p>The couple used course projects as an opportunity to start building real clients and work as sole traders to set themselves up to run their own business.</p>
<p>"The whole time I was studying I was thinking, 'Why am I employable?' - work ethic is everything," Abby said.</p>
<p>"There are so many people that have video talent and, at the end of the day, being employed comes down to work ethic and personality."</p>
<p>In 2009 the couple graduated, both with distinction, and soon after launched Lamp Studios - a multi-media company offering web design, graphic design and video storytelling.</p>
<p>"The first two years were really challenging - we'd get busy patches and then gaps of no work. But we'd be at work 9am until 5pm five days a week - even when there wasn't work."</p>
<p>Four years ago Abby got word of a TV3 contracting job based in Whanganui.</p>
<p>"The problem was applicants were required to have $12,000 worth of gear, and I didn't have that.</p>
<p>"I was going to have to give up the opportunity, but amazingly a retired Whanganui businessman heard about it and bought all the gear so that I could take the job.</p>
<p>"He made a massive investment in my career, and I'm not sure if I would be here today in Whanganui without his support."</p>
<p>After Abby locked in the contract with TV3 she got a huge referral and word of mouth started to spread.</p>
<p>"We decided the business needed to focus on one area and we thought what do we want to be known for ... and that was video.</p>
<p>"It was really important for us to stay in Whanganui - our family is here and Caleb is a surfer so it's great for that. Our job allows us to be based anywhere because only 20 per cent of the work is on the road filming."</p>
<p>Lamp Studios now employs three full-time staff, filming all over New Zealand as well as a recent trip to Cambodia to shoot four films about children living in the slums for the Flame charity.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Abby hopes to do more short term filming abroad but will continue to be based in Whanganui with Caleb and their toddler, Joseph.</p>
