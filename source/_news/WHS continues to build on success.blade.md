<p>Tēnā koutou,</p>
<p>As a new term begins, our consistent focus continues to be on effective teaching and learning. Our Senior students will begin preparation for the school examinations later on this term. Our Junior students will explore new option subjects with the change-over of their semesters.</p>
<p>At the beginning of July our Year 12 and Year 13 students attended our annual Whanganui High School Ball. The theme this year was &lsquo;<em>Into the Woods</em>&rsquo;. The evening was a resounding success due to months of hard work and planning by our Social Prefects. The Ball was enjoyed by all, and we felt proud of the responsible and mature behaviour of our students.&nbsp; The students were a complete credit to themselves and to their families.</p>
<p>This week we welcome students and visitors from our sister school in China and our sister school in Japan for a short stay summer school programme. A very warm welcome is also extended to our 23 new International students who come to us from a variety of countries &ndash; Austria, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Korea and Vietnam. We embrace the experiences and perspectives our visitors bring with them to our school.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Year 13 student Vincent Collins who is currently in London travelling to the Globe Theatre to represent New Zealand as part of the Shakespeare Globe Centre New Zealand Young Shakespeare Company.</p>
<p>Well done to Year 9 students Stella Warner and Ashley Cowley who were chosen as representatives in the Central Region Football Federation team to Sydney.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Central U18 Girls Hockey Team won gold at the recent national competition with the Boys team winning silver. Whanganui High School had three players in each team; Ryan Gray, Patrick Madder, Jordan Cohen, Emma Rainey, Joanna Bell and Rebecca Baker. Emma Rainey was awarded the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are considering Whanganui High School for your child&rsquo;s education next year, I urge you to submit your enrolment application as soon as you are able. Our school offers an enriching curriculum and an exciting range of extra-curricular opportunities. I look forward to welcoming your son or daughter to our school.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui,<br />Martin McAllen<br />Principal</p>
