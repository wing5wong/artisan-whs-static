<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui boys and girls teams have been on a scoring spree at their respective U15 National Hockey second-tier championship tournaments this week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Playing in Dunedin, the boys whipped central Otago 6-1 on Monday and then absolutely annihilated North Otago 20-nil yesterday morning.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coached by former Black Stick Robbie Matthews, the boys have drawn the tough Pool A with Canterbury B, Wellington B and North Harbour B also in action, but their form suggests they will be competitive as the tournament progresses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The boys were set to play Canterbury B late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the girls under coach Jan Dixon beat Manawatu B 4-nil on Monday, then comprehensively dealt to Wairarapa B 10-nil. They have drawn Pool D in Carterton and their toughest match in pool play will be Poverty Bay, a team they beat last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With only four teams in the pool, the Whanganui girls have already qualified for the quarter-finals regardless of yesterday's game against Poverty Bay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Matthews said the first two matches of the tournament were all-round solid team efforts by the boys, although she too conceded the tougher match-ups were yet to come.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There have been some higher-scoring games than ours so far and by teams we have yet to meet. Canterbury, North Harbour and Wellington will all be tough, but I think the boys are up to it," Matthews said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Goal scorers for the boys against Central Otago included Connor Managh (2), and <strong>Blake Hoskin</strong>, Charlie Sutton, <strong>Charnce Tangiiau</strong> and Ben Havord one each.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the goal-scoring bonanza against North Otago yesterday morning the lads again shared it round with top scorers Sutton and Hoskin slotting six apiece, while Managh and <strong>Tangiiau</strong> scored two each.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For the girls on Monday Margaret Hazelhurst, Ngatatau Tumango, <strong>Maggie Jones</strong> and Jan Abraham scored one each, while Tumango hit the back of the net three times against Wairarapa B, Abraham and Nicole Parata twice each and <strong>Jones, Olivia Smith</strong> and <strong>Charlotte Baker</strong> one each.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our toughest game will be against Poverty Bay. They have some nice players. We did beat them last year when we finished the tournament in fifth spot," Dixon said.</p>
