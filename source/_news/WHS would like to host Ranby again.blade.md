<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School would like to host Ranby again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui High School 1st XV ran into a Tawa College side at the peak of their powers in the final of the Mark Ranby Invitational on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After beating Freyberg High School 12-5 in the semifinals, WHS was shut out in the trophy game 44-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were beaten by their size, to be honest," said coach Danny Tamehana.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were big boys, good carries and finishing off the front foot."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tournament was still a success for WHS, who stepped in at the 11th hour to act as the hosts after trophy holders Kapiti College pulled out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Deputy principal Chris Friedel put the five-team tournament together in less than a fortnight, and Tamehana said hopefully the school had put its hand up to show they would be worthy of doing it again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Chris was pretty keen to set a high standard with the short window of opportunity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's definitely a worthwhile tournament for development."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tamehana and a number of his WHS players will now look forward to tomorrow's HYRC Series game as Display Associates Wanganui Under-18 take on Poverty Bay U18 in the 12.30pm curtain-raiser to the Mitre 10 Heartland Championship match-up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui drew 20-all with Wairarapa Bush last weekend in Masterton after the letting the home side back into the match.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The team is predominantly WHS and Wanganui Collegiate players, with a handful from the other local schools who contested the Wanganui Open competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tournaments continued for nine other WHS teams playing at venues around the North Island and two representatives at the Pool For School nationals in Christchurch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has been a tough week for the boys' footballers down at St Pats Silverstream, as they lost to the locals 4-0 on Wednesday and were trailing by a large score in their first 9th-16th playoff game yesterday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At the girls' hockey in Palmerston North, WHS had a 3-0 win over Macleans College on Wednesday to make the semifinals against New Plymouth Girls' High.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The A1 netballers competing in New Plymouth beat locals Sacred Heart 40-28 then lost to St Mary's Wellington 50-37 on Wednesday afternoon, heading into a playoff for ninth with Inglewood.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Napier, the badminton team had Wednesday victories over Takapuna and Hastings Boys.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under-15 rugby team started their Hurricanes region tournament in Wellington with a 22-10 loss to Francis Douglas, ahead of two games yesterday.</p>
