<p class="element element-paragraph">New Zealand rower Simon Watson will welcome a new tradition to Whanganui this Mother's Day - the Jennian Homes Mother's Day Fun Run/Walk.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson, a Whanganui old boy, will assist with the warm-up and 5km event at Lake Virginia from 10am on Sunday, May 13.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He represented New Zealand at the World Rowing Championships in 2010 where he won a bronze medal with the men's four and is one of 50 athletes participating nationwide.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event supports the Heart Foundation's Heart Foundation for Women campaign and 2018 marks the foundation's 50th anniversary year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Heart disease is the number one cause of death for women in New Zealand, claiming the lives of more than 50 women every week, and more than 3000 every year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jennian Homes COO Aidan Jury said having the support of Kiwi athletes will provide added motivation for everyone to get active and make a great start to their Mother's Day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Jennian Homes Mother's Day Fun Run/Walk continues to grow in popularity each year," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are grateful for these athletes, like Simon, to lend a hand and help save lives and keep more families together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event is enthusiastically embraced by women all over the country, but this year Jennian Homes is appealing for more men to get out and show their support.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This event brings women and their health to the forefront, and it would be great to see the men in their lives taking an active support role," Jury said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whether it's looking after the kids so mum can get in some training, cheering her from the sidelines or even lacing up their running shoes and joining in."</p>
