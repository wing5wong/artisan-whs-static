**Connor Hoskin, Head Boy at Whanganui High School recently received a Silver Award from the Student Volunteer Army to recognise his 250 hours of community service. He has currently notched up 361 hours, well on the way to achieving 500 hours and the Gold Award.**

Many of these hours have been earned through coaching and refereeing hockey including coaching the Under 15 Representative team and running programmes for those under 13 and under 11 players over the Christmas holiday period. He referees Under 13 and Under 15 games as well as High School’s second 11 hockey team.

Connor is a top hockey player himself having being selected for the Under 21 New Zealand Māori Men’s Team. He would have been playing in a tournament in Queensland this month but the competition was cancelled due to Covid-19.

Although he took up Economics only this year, he tutors international students in the subject, helping them to overcome language barriers to their understanding.

Until recently Connor was on the Whanganui Youth Council and helped to organise a number of events including a music festival and different youth events. Having participated in the Mitre 10 Tough Kids event himself, he now helps to organise it and is involved also in the teenage version of Tough Kids, called Tough Teens.

As Head boy he co-leads the team of 50 prefects and meets regularly with the principal. Recently he spoke to year 8 students to give them an idea of what it would be like for them if they attend High School next year.

So why does he do it? Connor’s answer is: “I just want to give back. I have been privileged to receive so much support myself.”

At the end of this year Connor plans to do a conjoint degree in commerce and science, majoring in finance, economics and IT either at Otago or Wellington.

**In the meantime, younger brother Blake, has received a bronze award from the Student Volunteer Army for his volunteer work.**
