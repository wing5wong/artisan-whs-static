<p><strong>HER second overseas excursion with the New Zealand Development team was a big personal success for Whanganui gymnast (WHS student) Millie Manning who returned with a host of medals and trophies from her trip to Hawaii this month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 16-year-old star pupil of the Wanganui Boys &amp; Girls Gym Club, who has to train without peers at her Level 9 grade at the club, finished third overall at both the 'Gymnastics in Paradise' show on January 8-10 and the 'Aloha Gym Fest', January 15-17.</strong></p>
<p>Manning put into practice the experience and confidence she gained with the Development team in Singapore the year before.</p>
<p>"Although Hawaii was more of a American competition, we were in much tougher competition," Manning said, already back training yesterday.</p>
<p>"It definitely tested my confidence, but I was more used to that international crowd from Singapore.</p>
<p>"If it had been my first international competition, it would have been hard."</p>
<p>Japanese and Australian gymnasts also entered the Hawaii events, although it was the Americans who were the ones to beat, taking 1-2 overall in Manning's Level 9 grades.</p>
<p>At the Paradise show, her best placings were bronze medals in the beam and the bar apparatus.</p>
<p>The following week, she won gold in the vault, silver on the floor routine and bronze on the bars.</p>
<p>"And if you get the overall [placings], yet get a trophy as well," Manning said.</p>
<p>It was a traditional island wooden trophy, which along with receiving a ceremonial sea shell, made for an interesting conversation when the New Zealanders came back through customs at Auckland.</p>
<p>"I just told them it had been treated [wood]."</p>
<p>Another big task for her now she is home will be sending off her impressive results to all her sponsors in a whole heap of "thank you" cards she will write. "It was massive, I raised half of what I needed [to travel] and the sponsors took care of the rest."</p>
<p>Manning has resumed training for gymnastics clinics in April, before the 2016 season starts in winter.</p>
