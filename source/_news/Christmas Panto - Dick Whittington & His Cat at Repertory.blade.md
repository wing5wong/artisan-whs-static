<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Some of the cast of&nbsp;</span></span><em>Dick Whittington and His Cat</em>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">at Carlton School to promote the upcoming show.&nbsp; L&gt;R; <strong>Ronan Shaw,</strong> Chris McKenzie, <strong>Maddison McKenzie and Heath McKenzie.</strong></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Repertory Theatre has announced their Christmas panto, a lively and comedic kiwi take on classic Victorian English rags-to-riches tale, Dick Whittington and his cat.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The show opens next Thursday evening, runs Friday evening as well as two matinee shows over the weekend and again the following Thursday and Friday evening, then a Saturday matinee, finishing on Sunday the 23rd with another matinee.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The original story follows the main characters as they extract themselves from poverty in rural Lancashire and make their way to the gold-paved streets of London in search of fortune, and is based on purported historical figures and events.&nbsp; In this new retelling, Dick and his cat Tom, travel from their dairy farm in native Hawera to the capital, Wellington in search of fortune; the story set to an energetic musical backdrop.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><strong>Dick Whittington will be played by year 10 WHS student, Heath McKenzie</strong>, who is excited at the prospect of his first major adult theatrical role.&nbsp; He is joined on stage by his sister Isabelle, who plays Tom the cat.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">It will be a directorial debut for Chris, who has been involved both on and off the stage with Repertory Theatre and Amdram for 12 years now.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Having played the dame in the last two Christmas pantos at repertory, he thought it might be time to hang up &ldquo;his boobs&rdquo;, but saw the chance to direct as a great opportunity to expand his skillset.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Filling his &ldquo;boobs&rdquo; instead will be the infamous Phil Hudson, just one of a universally strong and experienced cast and crew who have helped guide his first directing experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Richard Leith plays the villain; David Craig plays the mayor of Hawera, the mayor of Wellington and Chief Bananarama of the island of Luckylucky; Charlotte Elgar is the mayor&rsquo;s daughter; while Hawera neighbours, Ethel and Cecil Bethel, are played by Ashlyn Mo and <strong>Maddison McKenzie</strong> respectively; while Ian Jones plays the ship&rsquo;s boatswain.&nbsp; Ronan Shaw and <strong>Tori Whibley</strong> is stage crew and will be entertaining during scene changes.&nbsp; A specially selected cast, Chris says, have been a pleasure to work with.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">He also made special mention of the large and committed team of volunteers who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to get the show up and running and who have devoted their time to this for the love of theatre.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">&nbsp;&ldquo;As an actor you take for granted all the other aspects of production that bring the show to life.&nbsp; The actors turn up, make fools of themselves on stage and go home again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The Musical Director is Ciaran Ceallachan; Production Managers are Lizz Hudson and <strong>Reuben Janes</strong>; Stage Manager is <strong>Jacqui McKenzie,</strong> assisted by Meynell Smith; Lighting is by <strong>Konrad Shaw</strong>; Sound Tech is Jamie O&rsquo; Hagan; props were made by Yvonne and Ian Jones assisted by Karen Craig; wardrobe is managed by <strong>Linda Hardcastle</strong>; Set Designer is<strong> Charlotte Elgar</strong>, while construction was by <strong>James Sullenberger</strong> and<strong> Sam Julian</strong>; choreographer is WGC student Emma Hylton; their pianist is Shontae Arthur.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><em><strong>Tickets are on sale at the Royal Whanganui Opera House.&nbsp; There will be door sales as well.</strong></em></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Rock painter Selina Trevethick is helping promote the event.&nbsp; She has painted three large rocks, which have Dick and his Cat and the title of the show on them. These can be taken to the Opera House to be exchanged for a ticket to the show. She has also painted nine smaller ones which have just Dick and the cat and these can be brought to the theatre during the shows in exchange for a prize.&nbsp; Rocks will be placed on Thursday and Friday so people can start searching for them over the weekend.</p>
