<p><strong>These six students join several others from our school who attended ceremonies in Auckland and Dunedin last month.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These awards highlight the huge amount of time and effort that has gone into completing the Gold award, and it is fitting that these students ARE HONOURED. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Whanganui High School congratulates all students who complete the award. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A fine achievement indeed.</strong></p>
