Earlier this week some of our International students were learning how to write a recipe to follow procedural instructions. The class decided to incorporate some typical 'kiwi' food by making and decorating a pavlova, accompanied by kiwi onion dip, chippies and carrot sticks. At the same time, we farewelled our three short-term Thai students, Jaja, Chalisa and Nanoon. A big thank you to Mrs Su'a for her expert cooking and creative skills.
