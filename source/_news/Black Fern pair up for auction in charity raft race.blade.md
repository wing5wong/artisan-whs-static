<p><span><strong>Black Ferns Sosoli Talawadua (nee Tofa / former WHS student)&nbsp;</strong><span>and Toka Natua have volunteered their services</span> to help a team make the finish line in style at this years Raft Race.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The big rubber duckies are back on the river so it must be time for the annual Plumber Dan Raft Race.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each year, Whanganui plumber Dan Goldsworthy organises the charity race which attracts many weird and wonderful entries and raises valuable funds for a local charity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, the race is on Saturday February 17 and there will be three top prizes of $300 as well as three celebrities who will be auctioned off to lend their strengths to one of the teams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mayor Hamish McDouall can be hired by the highest bidder and so can a couple of World Cup rugby winners.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Black Ferns <strong>Sosoli</strong> Talawadua and Toka Natua have volunteered their services to help a team make the finish line in style.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The chosen charity this year is the Whanganui branch of Youth Diabetes NZ and manager Linda Carter said it is hoped the celebrities will fetch a good price.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to raise as much money as possible so whoever pays the most dollars to have a celeb' join their raft team has first choice."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are to be no powered devices in the race and each team must consist of four members with each person wearing a life jacket.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Entry forms are at 179 Victoria Ave or from Plumber Dan's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/PlumberDanWanganui/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;page. Cost is $50 per raft. Call Plumber Dan on 021 635517 for other information.</p>
