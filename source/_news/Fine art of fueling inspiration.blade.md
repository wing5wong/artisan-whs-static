<p>STATE OF THE ARTS: WHS student Vincent Collins and Tamara-Claire Stratton at the Feeling Inspired Youth Arts Review at the Edith Gallery.</p>
<p>From a family pet to the artwork of Rene Magritte, from drawings to videos, 20 young Whanganui artists have expressed what inspires them.</p>
<p>The artworks are part of the Feeling Inspired Youth Arts Review, currently on display at the Edith Gallery in Taupo Quay.</p>
<p>The review was organised by Whanganui District youth councillors Vincent Collins and Tamara-Claire Stratton, who wanted to hold an arts event for young people.</p>
<p>"We felt that there was a lack of creative projects being done in the youth committee and we wanted to address that," Tamara said.</p>
<p>"We wanted to engage young people in a public art event."</p>
<p>Mr Collins and Ms Stratton said they would have liked to see more entries, but overall they were pleased with the quality of the artwork.</p>
<p>The artwork was judged in three categories by performance artist James Graves, photographer Tiahuia Ranginui and Sarjeant Gallery curator Greg Donson.</p>
<p>"The review was open to anyone aged 12-24 years, so we decided to separate the works into three categories," Mr Collins said.</p>
<p>The winner of the 12-14 years category was Rose Hird; Amber Deadwood won the 15-18 years category; and Ngarongonui Mareikura took out the 19-24 years category.</p>
<p>There is also a People's Choice award, which visitors to the exhibition can vote for.</p>
<p>Mr Collins and Ms Stratton said they definitely want to hold another arts event next year.</p>
<p>"Whether it will be an arts review like this, or whether it will be something different, is what we're currently exploring," Mr Collins said.</p>
