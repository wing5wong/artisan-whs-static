<p>THE BROS: Whanganui riders Joe (left) and Riki Waninhouse have placed in their respective grades in the Central Cross Country Series.</p>
<p>WHANGANUI siblings Riki and Joe Wainhouse (<span>WHS student)</span>&nbsp;have finished third and fourth in their respective junior grades after the fourth and final round of the Central Cross Country Series at Tinui, east of Masterton on Saturday.</p>
<p>The tough competition involves the juniors racing for 90 minutes over a 10km track, and the recent wet weather ensured the course was challenging, but rideable for all competitors. Younger brother Riki (Kawasaki KX85) placed third out of 22 riders for the series in the Junior 85/150 class, while Joe (Yamaha YZ250F) finished fourth out of 17 riders in the junior 125/250 class. The pair are members of the Balance Chartered Accountants Junior Wanganui Motocross Academy, proving yet again what a success the newly launched initiative is.</p>
