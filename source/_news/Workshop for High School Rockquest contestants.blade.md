<p><span>Workshop for High School bands/solo acts who are entering the Rockquest.</span></p>
<p><span>Elizabeth (Lizzie) de Vegt, Lecturer in Music at UCOL supported by local musicians Sacha Keating, Michael Franklin-Browne and Andrew Condon, is organising an all day workshop and one hour mentoring sessions for High School bands/ solo acts who are entering the Rockquest in June. It will be on Saturday May 26 from 9am- late. I</span><span class="text_exposed_show">t will include a concert to follow in the evening at the Musician Club.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Lizzie says, &ldquo;I am running it because I am passionate about youth and music and I want to see youth do well with music. It&rsquo;s not really anything to do with UCOL other than them providing the sound gear.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">We have space for only six to eight bands in the workshop and want to take a few from as many schools as possible within the Whanganui region.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The concert starts at 7.30pm, and the students are encouraged to invite family and friends. Performers will receive feedback on their performance, stage presence and get help with technical things. It will be a great opportunity to build their confidence playing in a supportive environment.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">There is a $5 entry fee to the concert.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">For more information contact Lizzie at Ee.devegt@ucol.ac.nz or on 021 249 7773.</span></p>
