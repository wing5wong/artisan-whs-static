<p><span><span>It's a busy life for a young dancer and Emma Henare can testify to that.</span></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Within three days Henare, 14, completed jazz exams, performed at the NZCAF National Schools Hip Hop Championships and competed at DanceNZ Made.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The highlight for the Whanganui High School student was winning the national title with the Zynergy Mega Crew, who were also named the best overall.&nbsp; S<span>tudents Rebekah Phillips and Lauren Phillips were also a part of the&nbsp;</span><span>Zynergy Mega Crew.</span></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really enjoyed it, I just got in the zone, had so much fun and it was a big buzz with all the people there cheering us on," Henare says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Being named the best was unexpected, we didn't realise we would get that and it was a big celebration afterwards."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Zynergy Mega Crew is made up of students from High School, Girls' College, Cullinane College, Rangitikei College and City College.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That includes dancers from Aotea Empire, who defended their status as national champions at the event in Lower Hutt.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Zynergy members were selected through an audition process, they spent hours practising in the City College dance studio guided by Pauline Hiroti and Baillie Edwards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were amazing, they made the whole dance up and they put so much time and effort into it. They didn't have to, but they did," Henare said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"After the competition, Pauline said that we're now on the map and we're the people to beat because we've achieved this title and stepped up our game in Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the first year that the competition has allowed a mega crew to be formed with students from any school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At high school we don't have a hip hop group, which means that this mega crew gave everyone in the city a chance to learn hip hop, have fun and make friends," Henare said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At the dance competition the next day, we seemed to be a lot more supportive of each other and we were cheering each other on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If the hip hop competition didn't happen, schools would still be divided and we might not have talked to each other."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Henare is enrolled in the Sharyn Underwood School of Dance, she has a jazz and ballet background, but enjoys trying out new genres.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hip hop dancing has a different kind of energy to it, it's a lot more raw and a lot more popular than other styles," Henare said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"On television, the majority of dancing is hip hop which means a lot more people enjoy watching it because they've seen it before."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following her success with Zynergy, Henare would like to see hip hop dancing implemented in her own school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It needs to be pushed because we have quite a few dance competitions around like DanceNZ Made which is an opportunity for anyone to choreograph.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It can easily be organised, people just have to take the time to do it."</p>
