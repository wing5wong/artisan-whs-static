<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Years of hard work were rewarded when five Whanganui High School students received their gold Duke of Edinburgh Hillary Award at Government House in Wellington.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cameron Allerdice, Jackie Hazelhurst, Grace Selby, Methmi Perera and Kara Jurgens joined students from around New Zealand for the presentation of their certificates by Sarah Hillary, daughter of Sir Edmund Hillary and a supporter of the charity work being done in his name in Nepal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jemma de Smidt, who co-ordinates the gold award students for Whanganui High School, said they also attended a reception where they met with Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a wonderful opportunity to acknowledge the work done by these young people over several years," Ms de Smidt said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These awards highlight the huge amount of time and effort that has gone into completing the gold award and it is fitting that these students are honoured. Whanganui High School congratulates all students who complete the award. A fine achievement, indeed."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As the students shared their experiences from the programme, Cameron said he was "thankful for the opportunities" the scheme had given him, saying it was hard work but he had enjoyed bonding with friends.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jackie thanked Whanganui High School for encouraging as many students as possible to take part in the programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kara, who completed her award after leaving school, said the award "provides challenging experiences whilst creating friendships, and an opportunity for giving back to the community".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Methmi said she learned about perseverance and really loved the volunteering.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Grace teamed up with her local Scout Group and is now a warranted leader and the Zone Kea leader for her zone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The gold award requires students to complete activities in service, physical recreation, skills, adventurous journey and a residential project and takes a minimum of 18 months. Students must first have completed the bronze and silver awards.</p>
