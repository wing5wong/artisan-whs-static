<p><strong>SYDNEY BOUND: WHS student/Wanganui Athletic's&nbsp;Blake Sherman, left, Majre Apiata-Cook and coach Symon King (not shown)are excited for their Central Football squad's games in Australia this coming week.</strong></p>
<p>Three Wanganui Athletic club members have a plane to catch tomorrow as teenagers Majre Apiata-Cook and <strong>Blake Sherman</strong> will join coach Symon King with the Central Football Federation squad heading to Sydney for the M Sports Cup tournament.</p>
<p>The two 13-year-olds were selected for the 15-strong squad after trials in November-December alongside team mates from around the Central Football catchment of Gisborne, Palmerston North and Taranaki.</p>
<p>From Monday through to Wednesday, the boys grade tournament will consist of five round robin games against regional sides in the North Shore Mariners, Emerging Jets, Northern Tigers, Blacktown Spartans and the Apia Leichardt.</p>
<p>"Our internal goal is just to see how they fare against a different set of players from a different country, and where we are with their development," said King.</p>
<p>Apiata-Cook, of City College, is a goal keeper,<strong> while Sherman, Wanganui High School, plays left side defender.</strong></p>
<p>King said with five games in three days, the team would not have a first-string lineup.</p>
<p>"We will rotate as much as we can, we don't know what the heat's going to do. Keep them fresh as we can."</p>
<p>M Sports Cup (MSC) is for talented boys and girls born in 2002-2004.</p>
<p>It will be hosted at Valentine Sports Park (VSP) in Sydney, home of Football New South Wales.</p>
<p>International teams are invited, with NZ Football Federation teams attending in 2014-15 alongside squads from the top Australian National Premier League (NPL) clubs.</p>
