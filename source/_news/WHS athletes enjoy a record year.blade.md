<h4 class="element element-paragraph"><br />Sport Whanganui continues its review of college sport in the region, this week focusing on Whanganui High School.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><br />ATHLETICS</strong><br />School athletics this year at Whanganui High School was another successful year for the whole school. Having our four houses Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua made the day exciting with plenty of competitiveness and school spirit among everyone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The competitive races were an eye opener to what an amazing job coach Greg Fromont and assistant coach Elaine Baker have done with our athletes here at WHS.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><br />KAYAKING</strong><br />This year we had students from WHS compete at the Sprint Kayak Nationals held at Lake Karapiro. With Whanganui taking away 18 crews the majority of the squad made up of WHS students competing in the Men's Premier division down to age group events including under 13, under 14 and under 18. In the u18 age group Lucas Thompson at stroke, Jack Clifton and Cameron Russell absolutely destroyed their rivals in the K4 200m winning gold. Our kayakers won 14 gold.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><img src=http://c1940652.r52.cf0.rackcdn.com/5c6f1549ff2a7c6f500004e2/Kayaking-regatta-Feb-MULsnipped-sports-facebook.jpg alt="" /></p>
<p><strong><br />CYCLING</strong><br />Whanganui High School student Jack Overweel won gold in the U15 Boys Derby at the Age Group Track Nationals. He also came 2nd U15 Boys 500M Time Trial, 2nd U15 Boys 7.5Km Points Race, 2nd&nbsp; U15 Boys 500M Team Sprint (with Lachlan Foote) and 4th&nbsp; U15 Boys Scratch Race 3000M. This is a New Zealand premier national track cycling event for Age Group riders from U15's through to Masters riders. Riders are selected to represent their Cycling Centres ensuring the top riders attend to race for national titles. Track cycling events involve a mix of speed, skill and tactics. The sport is highly competitive and hugely entertaining, and because events are raced in a velodrome, track is arguably the best type of cycling for spectators.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><br />JUDO</strong><br />Whanganui High School student Keightley Watson has made the podium again with two medals at the 2019 Sydney Judo International. Following on his success in Canberra the previous weekend at the ACT Open where Watson won the Junior Men's 100kg+ division. In the Senior Men's 100kg+, Keightley had to settle for silver, losing to the Australian and Oceania No1 ranked heavyweight Liam Park, who he had beaten in the semifinals the previous week. Keightley Watson will have no down time since arriving back home, as preparations begins for the Asia-Pacific Championships, being held April 20-22 in the United Emirates at Fujairah, where he will represent New Zealand in the 100kg+ Senior Men's team.</p>
