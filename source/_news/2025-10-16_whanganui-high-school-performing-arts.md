Sophie Toyne wins again!

Young Whanganui singer Sophie Toyne from Whanganui High School (Year 11) has won another award in the world of country music.

Last Saturday, October 4, she was triumphant at the NZ Country Music Association Entertainer of the Year event, following on from success in January in Tamworth, Australia's country music capital.

Saturday saw the 15-year-old Whanganui High School student win the intermediate section for 14- to 18-year-olds at the Baycourt Community and Arts Centre in Tauranga.

Sophie, who has a new album, Orange Skies, available online, sang Mary Did You Know by Pentatonix, and Wildflowers and Wild Horses by Lainey Wilson.
