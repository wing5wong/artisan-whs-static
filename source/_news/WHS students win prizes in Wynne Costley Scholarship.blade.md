<p><strong>Congratulations to (L-R): Olivia Bedwell, Rhian Robertson, Brianna Walker, Hannah Lawler - all prize winners in the Wynne Costley Research Scholarship Awards.</strong></p>
<p>The Whanganui Chapter of the National Council of Women recently held an essay writing competition where students were asked to write about any New Zealand Woman who has made a significant contribution to New Zealand.&nbsp; On Friday 12 October, several of our students were awarded prizes in the inaugural Wynne Costley Scholarship competition. The function celebrated the lives of many of the strong and inspirational women in New Zealand, and some of these women were written about by our students.</p>
<h4>In the Junior category, Olivia Bedwell (y9) was a joint winner with her sister Sophie who is at WIS. Her topic was Lesley Elliott.</h4>
<h4>In the Senior competition, Y13 students all wrote about Kate Shepard, with Brianna Walker achieving the top overall prize and a total of $1000 in prize money. Hannah Lawler came second, and Rhian Robertson achieved third place. Brianna&rsquo;s winning essay will be published in the NCW newsletter.</h4>
<p>Well done girls, fantastic effort!</p>
