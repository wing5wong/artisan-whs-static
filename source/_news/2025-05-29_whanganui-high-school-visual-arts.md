Our Year 11 Visual Art akonga had a fantastic day out. 

Ming Ranginui (WHS Alumni) began the day with an inspirational talk about her work. 

Students were engaged and in awe of her successes, as she's carving her place in the New Zealand Art arena.

At the Museum students did observations drawings, then a photographic scavenger hunt around Queens Park and created a response to Paul Maseyk's mesmerising exhibition at the Te Whare o Rehua Sarjeant Gallery.

Thank you to Vanessa from the Sarjeant Education team for making it such a fun day.
