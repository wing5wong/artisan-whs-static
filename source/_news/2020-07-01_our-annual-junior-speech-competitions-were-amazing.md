#### Today we had our annual Junior Speech Competition.

**Year 9 speeches had a 2-4 minute ‘How To’ topic.**  

* **1st Toby Clark** delivered a compelling argument about ‘how to save the world in one easy step’.  

* **In a close 2nd Aarna Marwah** had the support of all the younger siblings in the room, teaching them how to be the best.  

* **3rd Finnian Sinclair** is going to get us all arresting my teaching us ‘how to rob a bank’.

**Year 10 speeches had a 3-5 minute topic on their ‘Taonga’ / 'Treasure'.**  

* **1st, for the second year in a row Alyssa Hartley** controlled the stage and the audience giving us an exceptional insight into the 1st IV… years of life.  

* **2nd Ela Robbins** had a very insightful speech on the importance of understanding our differences in perspectives.  

* **3rd George Davey** after his lockdown experience gained some insights on a new appreciation of his free time.

The competition was fierce and the judges had some tough decision to make.
Well done to all the top students who represented their classes.
You should be proud!
