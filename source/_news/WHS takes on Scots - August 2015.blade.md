<p>THE Wanganui High School 1st XV will put itself to the test when it tackles Scots College at Cooks Gardens on Saturday in a Land Rover 1st XV competition clash.</p>
<p>After finishing runners-up in the Manawatu Colts Under-21 championship to Massey White, WHS wanted to stretch itself and take on one of the stronger schools in the country.</p>
<p>It had the choice of playing in the Co-ed Cup 1st XV competition for co-ed schools, or the Land Rover competition open to all 1st XVs. It includes Scots College which just went down to St Pat's Town in the final of the strong Wellington competition.</p>
<p>Scots College went into that final favourites after finishing top qualifier. Its 19-8 loss to St Pat's Town followed a premier one finals trend. It was the fifth successive year a team had gone into the Wellington final with an undefeated record and lost.</p>
<p>Scots College also shared the national 1st XV trophy last year after drawing 26-all with Hamilton Boys High.</p>
<p>WHS deputy principal Chris Friedel said the team was keen to pit itself against strong national school sides and the Land Rover competition fitted the bill.</p>
<p>"After such a good season we were keen to take on one of the stronger schools in the country. Scots College may be a strong side, but they don't know how strong we are - they don't know anything about us. We will be fielding our strongest team possible for Saturday's match," Friedel said yesterday.</p>
<p>The winner of the 4pm match at Cooks Gardens on Saturday will play Gisborne Boys' High School in an away semifinal of the Land Rover competition.</p>
