<p>Attn Jazz lovers - The Blue Orchid play should appeal to you</p>
<p>- Written and Directed by Graham Dack</p>
<p><strong>There are 21 classic jazz songs throughout the show sung by Cypress Kani-Hurinui</strong> and backed by some of Whanganui&rsquo;s best singers - Shelly Walls, Jayne Fields and Iutita Kilmister. The band is made up of well-known Whanganui musicians, Abigail Livesay, Michael Smyth, Dave Griffiths and Michael&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">Petersen<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Blue Orchid is a renowned hotspot on the New York Jazz scene with a reputation for introducing exceptional, new musical talent to world. The club and its owner have seen it all, when names blazed brightly above the door, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Etta James, Julia London &ndash; so many got their first break at the Club.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">But 20 years on, the Club is on the brink of bankruptcy. Unless Lucky (Nigel Irwin) can come up with a stellar act to carry them through and bring back the punters, it&rsquo;s over. Lucky&rsquo;s daughter Rusty, (Cypress Kani-Hurinui), wants to prove to her father that she can sing.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">She is young, headstrong and has the perfect voice if only her father would give her a chance. She has grown up in the Club and the only thing between her taking the stage is her father and the truth about her mother.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Six o&rsquo;clock is looming, the bankers are moving in&hellip; Will Rusty save the Club with the backing of her father or will all be lost?<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Sit back and enjoy a stellar line up of singers and musicians and a great playlist. Including songs from Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Nat King Cole and many more&hellip;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Other members of the cast are Colin Lutrell (Sam) and Julian Annear (Jo).<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Tickets will go on sale July 19 and can be purchased through the Whanganui i-Site or through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iticket.co.nz/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="async" data-lynx-uri="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iticket.co.nz%2F&amp;h=AT01mBVG_vs61SEpJoZIvY4qy4ZqoRVbE5EVj_t9RMGDWqONEbvOKEymC64woeAboXXD7i4NKb_BZyNH3JzEH-6BwZ8s1EBbCTfDyPASw0Tp0poUZ74s5REedqc1Dm2AE96hh0UscTZ6KdG1V7DmzAkMxdz8mO66KxhERB1xBDoeWY5-ZoIx6RG2MlGg_4LIE-6BPtV0AL57LybXiAfUxq-idcWdiYHndJMEOK0CbPxzTtuBEtkehvHz14EEwkfBw2nrqb_APUB6Izo70Igb7HUUDPd3DldzuJ3d9bWXrN305XIPkt30vEL4I-rLYl0j3TLD_CJ3Ym5vND_gg1wG17I0WMkfAmvsuQ">www.iticket.co.nz.</a></span></p>
