<p><span><strong>WHS student Jess Watkin</strong> has been in form for Central Districts Hinds.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui cricketer <strong>Jessica Watkin</strong> gave an allrounder's effort for the Central Districts Hinds but it was not enough to prevent a five wicket loss to the Otago Sparks in their 50-over match in Alexandra on Sunday.</p>
<p>Walking onto Molyneux Park with the score at 58/3, with Anndion Lodge Wanganui teammate Michelle Mitchell out for 12, Watkin would top score for her team with 61 from 88 balls, including five boundaries and a six.</p>
<p>Her key partnerships were with opener Melissa Hansen (33) and then wicketkeeper Kelly Rangi (40). Watkin fell to a catch in the 45th over with Central having worked through to 169/6 and ultimately scrabbling 203/8 from their overs.</p>
<p>Otago were led by a superb 125 not out from their captain Suzie Bates, and seemed to have the match well in hand at 156/1 in the 36th over.</p>
<p>However, after the run out of Leigh Kasperek (47), <strong>Watkin</strong> had three straight dismissals to catches taken off her spinners to reduce Otago to 188/5 after 44 overs.</p>
<p>Bates nonetheless kept her resolve and the winning runs were struck in the 49th over. <strong>Watkin</strong> finished with 3-42 from her 10 overs.</p>
<p>The Hinds were to meet the Sparks again in Alexandra yesterday.</p>
<p>Former Wanganui player Henry Collier's match with the Central Districts A team against Northern Districts A was rained out on Sunday at Lincoln Oval, while yesterday's game with the same opposition was expected to be a delayed start.</p>
