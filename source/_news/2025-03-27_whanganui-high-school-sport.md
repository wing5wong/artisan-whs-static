Great night tonight at the Marae for our Maadi squad having special guests NZ Rowers Kerri Williams, Georgia Nugent Oâ€™Leary and ex WHS old boy Chris Harris coming for dinner and giving out some very inspiring messages to the team heading into finals day.

Was also great to see Principal Mr McAllen and his wife for the evening.

Our squad has made 14A Finals and 9B Finals over the next two days.

Outstanding effort team! Wishing you all the very best for the last two days of Maadi.
