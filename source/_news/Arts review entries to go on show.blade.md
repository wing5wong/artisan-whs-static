<p>ENTRIES for the 2017 Belton, Smith and Associates Limited Whanganui Arts Review closed on Thursday with about 145 entries were submitted.</p>
<p>Sophie Wham is one, entering her photographic work in the Dub.Dee.See Youth Award category.</p>
<p>The $250 award is sponsored by the Whanganui District Council Youth Committee which aims to encourage young local artists.</p>
<p>"My art teacher told us about the award and I decided to put my entry in," said Sophie.</p>
<p>The Year 12 Whanganui High School student is one of just 10 people aged from 12 to 24 to enter the category.</p>
<p>It is a relatively new category and Youth Committee co-chairwoman Macy Duxfield said she has been spreading the word around school art departments as well as UCOL to encourage student participation.</p>
<p>"I think young people in Whanganui need to be more confident in presenting their art.</p>
<p>There is real prestige to be gained from winning the award."</p>
<p>Last year's winner of the Dub.Dee.See Youth Award, James Graves, can attest to that.</p>
<p>Mr Graves, now living in London and about to start work at the National Gallery says he first entered the Arts Review three years ago.</p>
<p>"I was still studying for my Bachelor of Fine Arts at UCOL," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It's like a 'who's who' of Whanganui artists and it was exciting to enter amongst some of our leading international artists."</p>
<p>Although he did not win that year, he entered his 2016 collection of 180 napkins - each one annotated with the location, date, and time of its collection.</p>
<p>"It was a risky move, and not at all in the same league aesthetically as the beautifully crafted works in the same show," he said.</p>
<p>"But it had a concept, as I was interested in the 'nowness' of objects and places, the physical act of being present, and obsessive actions."</p>
<p>The award has given the young artist great validation and confidence, he said.</p>
<p>"It gave me a real boost, and is one of the things I take with me mentally as I complete my adventure overseas."</p>
<p>As well as the youth category, the review carries an open award of $2000; three highly commended awards of $500 plus merit awards to the value of $150.</p>
<p>The 2017 entries will be on display at Sarjeant on the Quay from March 4 until May 14.</p>
