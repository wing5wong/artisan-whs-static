<p>We held two days of athletics this year with the Y9-10 compulsory day of over 600 students taking part and competing in their form classes throughout the day.</p>
<p>This was once again a huge success with form teachers, peer mentors and form classes working together competing at all disciplines.</p>
<p>Our Senior Athletics day was also a successful day with over 500 students taking part in the day. This year we also bought our top 10 junior athletes in all disciplines to compete at the senior athletic day.</p>
<p><strong>We had 4 WHS records broken on the day:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mitchel Millar &ndash; 14.15m in Shot Put for Senior Boys</strong></p>
<p><strong>Briella Maua &ndash; 9.28m in Shot Put for Intermediate Girls</strong></p>
<p><strong>Javontae Alabaster-Wroe &ndash; 14.18m in Shot Put for Intermediate Boys</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sophie Andrews &ndash; 26.94m in Discus for Junior Girls</strong></p>
<p>WHS also represented the school well at the Wanganui Secondary School Athletics Champs with 110 athletes competing.</p>
