<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />Whanganui Roller Derby League the West Coast Bombers will once again host their foremost roller derby event All-Day Derby on June 22 at Jubilee Stadium.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">This is the third annual running of this event comprising eight teams in four full-length roller derby match ups.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">This year the West Coast Bombers have decided to make the day free entry, however they will accept a koha or canned food item for a local charity.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Fast-paced and actionpacked, roller derby is a contact sport played on quad skates on an indoor track.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Each of the four full-length games promise thrills, skills and spills, all easily viewed from Jubilee Stadium&rsquo;s indoor grandstands. Free entry will allow spectators to come and go throughout the day, with doors opening at 10.30am.</p>

<p data-bind="text: $data">This promises to be a showcase of some of the best skills in New Zealand and is one not to be missed.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The finale at 5pm is the allmale match up where the Northern Gentlemen take on the No City Skaters.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">In previous years each team has taken a win, and so who will take out this best of three?</p>
