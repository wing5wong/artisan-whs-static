Last term our Year 11 Business Studies students ran a very successful Market Day, with all groups making a profit. All groups were required to pay a 15% tax. The group which made the largest profit got to choose a charity for the tax to be paid to. Earlier this week we had Mariana Alletson-Collins visit us from The Heart Foundation to collect a donation of $350.
