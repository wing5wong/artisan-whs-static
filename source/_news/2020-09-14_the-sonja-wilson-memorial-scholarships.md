Every year in September, the IRMT Wanganui branch runs its major performance competition, the Sonja Wilson Memorial Scholarships, for young musicians of Grade 6 and above. This event was established in 2005 in memory of Sonja Wilson, the IRMT Chairperson for several years and a well-known pianist and teacher in the region.

Since then, the competition has expanded to include further awards and trophies in memory of local musicians and teachers – the Nita Oldham Award for the most promising singer, the Clarice Weir Scholarship for most promising string player and the Judy Barrett Memorial Cup for “outstanding piano performance”.

There are two parts to this annual event, held this year on Saturday, 12 September (preliminaries) and Wednesday, 16 September (finals).

The preliminary rounds adjudicated this year by Iain Tetley, Conductor of Whanganui’s Schola Sacra Choir, will take place at St Paul’s Church Hall, Cooks St, beginning at 9.00am with the Intermediate class (Grade 6 & 7 students).

Then in the afternoon from 2pm, the seniors (Grade 8 and above) followed by Nita Oldham Vocal class at 4pm. The Senior class runs as a preliminary event from which 5 finalists will be selected, who then go on to perform a 15 minute programme in the Prince Edward Auditorium, Wanganui Collegiate School.

This year the Finals will be held on Wednesday, 16 September at 7pm. In addition, the winner of the Intermediate Class and the winner of the Nita Oldham trophy, will showcase their talent with a short performance at the end of the evening.

The adjudicator for this year’s finals is Dr Graham Parsons, well known composer and lecturer from Palmerston North.
