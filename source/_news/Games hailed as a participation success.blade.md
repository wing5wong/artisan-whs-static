<p class="element element-paragraph">It was smaller than hoped, but eagerly contested by those who were there as the inaugural Whanganui Youth Games wrapped up yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Based on an idea pitched by Dilan Raj and Andy Lock to the Den of Dragons in 2016, the invitation schools tournament saw 11 basketball teams, ten netball squads and eight golfing teams contesting competitions over the previous three days.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mana College (junior boys) and <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> <strong>(junior girls) won the basketball events, while the WHS girls made it a ball-sport double by winning the netball module</strong>, with Hawera High School second and Cullinane College third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The <strong>top golfers</strong> were Collegiate's Tara Ray and <strong>WHS's Blake Sherman</strong>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Raj said the feedback for their first event was "overwhelmingly positive".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Reassured us that we are on the right track in addressing issues of drop off in participation numbers at Year 9 and Year 10 and subsequently the social issues that occur when youth are not involved in sports.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Youth Games after this year has already garnered a good supporters base and with many Year 9s returning next year, the number of schools entering will grow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Opportunities for similar aged youth to play against each other in an Olympic-style structure is limited and the Youth Games has gone a long way in addressing that by creating a valuable and memorable experience."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As a cricket man, Raj also appreciated this first event was blessed with fine weather for the three days.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The games were supported through funding from the Council-run Den of Dragons, Steve Caudwell photography, Two Monkeys web design, Local &amp; Loyal, and Display Associates.</p>
