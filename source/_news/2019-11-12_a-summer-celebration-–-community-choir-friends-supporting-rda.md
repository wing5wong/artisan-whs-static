The Whanganui Community Choir and Friends will be presenting their end of year Charity Concert - ‘A Summer Celebration’ in support of ‘Riding for the Disabled,’ on Saturday, November 9.

Their guests feature the trio of Win Livesay (voice), Ingrid Culliford (flute) and Abigail Livesay (piano) as well as collegiate student, Ethan Castellanos and the **Whanganui High School Choir – AwaSide.**

Ethan will be singing the Elvis Presley number, ‘Can’t Help Falling in Love.’ **AwaSide, who did very well in the recent secondary schools choir event based in Whanganui, will sing by themselves and with the Community Choir.**

Musical Director, Lynn Whiteside, says there will be a wide range of popular music including ‘All the leaves are brown’, ‘Circle of Life’ and ‘Heal the World’. There will also be a song in Te Reo Maori, a schola sacra type number and a selection from Mamma Mia.

The concert starts at 2pm at the Christ Church Anglican Church in Wicksteed Street. It will be followed by afternoon tea, with the food served in tiered plates.

Tickets cost $20 for adults and $15 for seniors. Students pay $10 and children under 12 are free. They can be purchased at the door or from a choir member or by phoning Edwyna on 344 7974/027 360 1335.

The proceeds go to help RDA purchase the land they currently lease to ensure their invaluable work continues. There will also be a donation box for anyone wanting to make a donation.
