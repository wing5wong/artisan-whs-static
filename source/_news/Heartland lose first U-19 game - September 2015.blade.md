<p>The NZ Heartland Under-19 XV and their Wanganui representatives did not get the start they wanted at the Jock Hobbs Memorial U-19 competition in Taupo on Sunday.</p>
<p>Heartland was defeated by Counties-Manukau 31-13 in their first game.</p>
<p>They had managed to close the gap to 21-13 while Counties had a man in the sinbin, as No8 Filipo Veamatahau (North Otago) scored from a powerful surge from the back of a 5m scrum, after prop and captain Charlie Henare had been held up over the line.</p>
<p>However, Counties worked a smart play from the scrum for their first-five to dummy into the gap and score under the posts, before getting a penalty in injury time of the 70 minute match to wrap things up.</p>
<p>Kaierau's Joe Edwards (former WHS student) started the match in the front row, while Taihape back Taylor Transom started on the bench.</p>
<p>Kaierau lock Dominic Broadhead <span>(former WHS student)&nbsp;</span>was not selected for the match, while Ruapehu hooker Gabriel Hakaraia was injured before the start of the tournament.</p>
