<p>RIDING HIGH: &nbsp;New national women's skateboard champion Naomi Craig finds some air down at the Kowhai Park skate bowl.</p>
<p>Naomi Craig's skateboard is taking her places she never dreamed of.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Wanganui High School student won the women's open at the Cheapskates Skateboard National Championship at Porirua Park on Waitangi Day.</p>
<p>Two years ago she would never have dreamed such a lofty achievement was possible.</p>
<p>While Naomi had rolled around on a board in rather ungainly fashion as a toddler, it was only in more recent times she began to get the hang of it.</p>
<p>"I did roll around on one when I was little, but it wasn't until much later that I boarded regularly," Craig said.</p>
<p>Like many teenagers, boarding began as a form of transport for the affable young skater.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I used my skateboard to get around town instead of a bike and it was only two years ago I started trying a few tricks."</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The skateboard bowl at Kowhai Park in Wanganui East and the streets and pavements around town became her practice grounds.</span></p>
<p>Living on Durie Hill means it's a pretty quick trip to town, but the payback is the return trip home up the Durie Hill stairs with skateboard in hand.</p>
<p>Skateboarding is pretty much a male-dominated sport and Craig is one of only a few females seen regularly kick-flipping, frontsiding, backsiding, faking or performing the ollie down at Kowhai Park. Most are young teenage boys.</p>
<p>Among her favourite moves are the kick-flip, blunt-faking and ollie.</p>
<p>"They're good guys down here at the park and they've given me a few good tips that came in handy at the nationals in Porirua.</p>
<p>'I might take it a bit further, but I'd rather keep the passion [for skating] and not get too seriously into competitions at this stage," Craig said.</p>
<p>For her performances at the nationals Craig won a bunch of skateboarding gear, including clothing and shoes, but her favourite prize was a new deck, the riding platform screwed to the trucks, or front and rear wheel assemblies.</p>
<p>"I've only got one board, so it was neat to get a new deck for when my old one gets worn out."</p>
<p>The Cheapskates Skateboard Nationals is run in conjunction with the Porirua Skate Jam which is now a regular mainstay of the Porirua Festival of the Elements.</p>
<p>The Porirua Skate Jam offers local skaters, alongside talent from all over the country, the opportunity to compete for prizes, recognition and the respect of their peers.</p>
