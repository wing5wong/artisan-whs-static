Today the winners of this year's Whanganui Smokefreerockquest competition in the band category have been announced, both winning a prize package from the Rockshop and going into the national selection pool for the event’s live national final, held at the Dorothy Winstone Centre, Auckland on September 12.

**Progressive rock band In Business from Cullinane College and Whanganui High School took out top spot in this year’s competition. Bassist, Tomas Bidgood, said they were surprised to win.**

“It feels really good to win,” says the Year 11 student. “Especially as we took out the ZM Best Song award as well after working so hard. We all come from different genres of music and combine all of our interests which gives us a unique sound. Having grown together as a band since our first Smokefreerockquest, has given us a special connection on stage and in writing new material.”

The other members of In Business are Max Hughes (drums), Christian Garratt (guitar) and Faith Solomona (vocals).

Flower of Hades from Ruapehu College took out the second spot. Both bands join the **Whanganui regional solo-duo winners, Dennihe and Toa from Whanganui High School (first)** and Maui Wowee from Ruapehu College (second) with the opportunity to submit a video of their original material for selection as one of the top 10 national finalists.

Chairperson and General Manager, Matt Ealand, reflected on the role played by the platform to encourage smokefree lifestyles saying: “The relationship between Smokefree and Rockquest Promotions goes back 28 years. We have seen the culture around smoking and music change over that time and that is something we are really proud to have been a part of.”
