<p>THE GODS DESCENT: Millie Manning (left) and Tessa Russell walk the track for Wanganui High School's Greek and Roman Gods team.</p>
<p>It was all about the atmosphere at this year's Relay for Life,&nbsp;participants&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>"This is my first time and it's just been a ball," said Tracy Rawcliffe, who was part of The Warehouse team in this year's Cancer Society fundraiser.</p>
<p>Teammate Donna Kara said the atmosphere as people walked around the track was one of her favourite parts.</p>
<p>Ms Kara had several family members who died from cancer, and Ms Rawcliffe's father had it.</p>
<p>Other teammates Sam Solomon and Monique Campbell, also had loved ones affected by cancer.</p>
<p>"Everybody knows somebody who's been affected by it," Ms Solomon said.</p>
<p>She enjoyed "hanging with everybody" during the 24-hour relay, while Ms Kara said she liked meeting people.</p>
<p>She described the experience as "mean".</p>
<p>"I felt it in my legs, but it's mean."</p>
<p>Ms Rawcliffe was "looking forward to next year".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Shona Buchanan was making her way around the track with her husband, Mike, who was in a wheelchair with a sprained ankle.</p>
<p>She said they had been "in and out" over the 24 hours.</p>
<p>They were with the team Hot Pink Flamingos.</p>
<p>Mrs Buchanan said there was great community spirit at the relay and enjoyed seeing children and families joining in.</p>
<p>She came back to the relay in the early hours of the morning, and said it was very peaceful.</p>
<p>Event co-ordinator Kat Wade said there had been a fantastic crowd, including teams from four secondary schools and two primary schools.</p>
<p><strong>"Wanganui High School actually had a team of about 80 kids</strong>," she said.</p>
<p>"We were stoked this year that lots of people stayed overnight."</p>
<p>Ms Wade said the atmosphere was something special.</p>
<p>"For the whole 24 hours just the buzz has been consistently up," she said.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
