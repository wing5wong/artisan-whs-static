That’s a wrap for slowpitch 2024. With a mix of teams and abilities, a big thank you to all of our experienced players who showed great leadership skills with our learners and also a big thanks to our coaches - Paul Brewer (Seniors), Stephen Barnes (Juniors) and Khortez Nikora-Joseph (1st XV). We couldn’t do it without you.
