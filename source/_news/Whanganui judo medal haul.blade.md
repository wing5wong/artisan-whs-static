<p><strong>THE CLAN: The Whanganui Watsons, Kasey (left), Wayne and Keightley joined up-and-coming junior Marshall Littlefair to bring home 10 medals form the National Judo Championships in Auckland.</strong></p>
<p>Wanganui Judo Club fighters have ended the season on a real high note bringing home 10 medals from the New Zealand Championships in Auckland at the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Leading the charge was 15-year-old (WHS student) Keightley Watson who excelled against older and higher graded judokas (fighters) winning four gold and four national titles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Watson</strong> <strong>first won gold and the national junior men over 90kg title before tackling the junior men open weight division. The blue belt beat three black belts in a row to take gold and the national title. The beaten brigade included judokas from the New Zealand representative team from the Oceania competition.</strong></p>
<p>Cousin (WHS student)&nbsp;<strong>Kasey Watson (17) took bronze in the Young Men's under 73kg weight category.</strong> Coach and Kasey's father Wayne Watson also competed on Saturday in the Masters divisions and won two gold.</p>
<p>Sunday's competition brought more success for the Wanganui Club with Marshall Littlefair (9) completing a strong season with silver in the Junior Boys under 32kg grade to add to his tally throughout the year.</p>
<p><strong>Both Kasey and Keightley were back on the mat for the afternoon competition in the Cadet Men's divisions with Kasey winning silver in the under 73kg group while Keightley again won gold and the national title in the Cadets over 81kg class.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cadets Open Weight grade was the last division to be held on the day, and the fight for the finals was between the cousins, with Keightley winning the gold medal and New Zealand Cadet Open title to add to his hall of gold medals at the tournament.</strong></p>
<p>This was the final competition for the year in New Zealand and good results to end on, especially for Keightley Watson.</p>
<p>The teenager had won a host of medals at international competitions in Sydney, Canberra and Queensland earlier this year.</p>
