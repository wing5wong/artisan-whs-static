<p class="element element-paragraph">They are the two latest young men in growing queue of local paddlers who have taken their first steps to Europe from Whanganui Airport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School teenagers Jack Clifton and Liam Lace flew out of Whanganui on Friday to connect with their Auckland Airport flight to the Northern Hemisphere for the 2018 ICF canoe sprint junior and under-23 world championships.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The pair are part of a more "stream lined" New Zealand team of four competitors in the Under 18 grade and four more in the Under 23 grade, which includes another Whanganui exponent in junior world champs veteran <strong>Max Brown</strong>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After a two week training camp in France, the New Zealanders will head to Plovdiv in Bulgaria, where Lace and Clifton will be part of the K4 500m crew, while Clifton will also race as part of the K2 1000m.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Under coach Brian Scott, they have been training since the callup in April, despite some challenging cool weather conditions on the Whanganui River this winter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Just quite cold," Clifton shrugged.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Pretty glassy, nice and flat," Lace added.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their first international competition was in May at the Asia Pacific Sprint Cup at the canoe sprint regatta in Adelaide, where they won gold and silver in the K4 500m and 1000m respectively, while Clifton also got two silvers in the K2 races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But the long journey to Plovdiv is a very different proposition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Definitely a lot more nerves than last time," said Clifton."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Eastern European countries are on a whole different level of paddling," said Lace.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brown and the rest of the Under 23 team are already in France and have been training with their national team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Scott said Brown will get to race at the upcoming French national championships, which is an unusual opportunity as foreign competitions usually got get to take part.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The boys have a French coach, Frederic Loyer, who may have opened some doors."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When they arrive, Lace and Clifton will have about a day to link up with Brown before he competes, and then both squads will move onto Plovdiv.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They can ask any questions of their townmate then as Brown has competed in Europe at Under 18 and Under 23 level before.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Clifton's primary concern for being a young man so far from home is the language barrier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's the heat for me &ndash; just getting used to below 15 degrees training [here], then crack into the 30's." said Lace.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Clifton's family was there to see him off from Whanganui Airport while Lace's parents were already visiting in Auckland and so will go to the airport there to send him off.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The junior world champs are July 26-29.</strong></p>
