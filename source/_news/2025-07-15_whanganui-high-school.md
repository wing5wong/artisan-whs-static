Ia orana no Tahiti

19 students from the French and reo Māori departments are staying with homestays in Tahiti learning French and Tahitian.  With language lessons in the morning and cultural activities in the afternoon everyone is having a fantastic time – Ka mau te wehi!

We chose to go to Tahiti after teachers watched Scotty Morrison’s TV show – Origins.  Not only are Tahitian and te reo Māori really similar, they also share some ancient tupuna. On the plane over, we saw Scotty Morrison who was going to Tahiti to film the third in his Origins series and he posed with us for photos at the airport.  Mīharo!
