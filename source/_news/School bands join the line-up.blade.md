<p>Whiskey Mama is hosting two Whanganui High School bands at Rock on the River on January 6.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It&rsquo;s new to Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed &mdash; bands on the back of a truck in the carpark.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Caroline has been trying to get our band, Whiskey Mama, up there,&rdquo; says Fred Loveridge, Whiskey Mama lead guitarist.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The band comprises Fred (guitar, vocals), Kerry O&rsquo;Sullivan (lead vocals), John Steedman (bass, vocals), Kevin de Lacy (keyboard) and Glen Marsh (drums).</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Kerry came up with this idea about making a bit of noise about it . . . then we came up with this second idea of having a couple of the school bands. I&rsquo;ve been tutoring a couple of these bands [at Whanganui High School]. They did the Rockquest thing earlier in the year and one of the players got the Best Female Musicianship award.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The bands &mdash; In Business and Ferris &mdash; have been supporting touring bands at Lucky Bar + Kitchen.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;The more experience they have playing live, the better they&rsquo;ll be. They seem to want to pursue music and playing live is where it&rsquo;s going to be at.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Fred says the school bands have probably a total of 90 minutes&rsquo; material and Whiskey Mama will fill the rest.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;That gives them experience playing with a band like us, because when you&rsquo;re on a bill, you have to work with other bands.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The event is called Rock on the River and will be at Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed in Aramoho on Sunday, January 6.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The bands will play from a truck trailer parked beside the outside seating area of the hotel.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;In Business will be on from 2pm. They were Year 9 kids, so very young, and they&rsquo;re a good little band. They&rsquo;ll be doing a combination of their own songs and some covers. I&rsquo;ve heard them do some Red Hot Chilli Peppers and even some old Beatles tracks and they&rsquo;ve written some really good songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ferris will follow In Business. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re sort of more Indie Pop and they do totally their own songs. They&rsquo;ve got 30 to 40 minutes of original material so they&rsquo;ve done extremely well.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Admission is free.</p>
