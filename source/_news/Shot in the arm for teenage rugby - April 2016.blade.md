<p>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The introduction of the Metropolitan side into the 11-team Manawatu colts' championship has given teenage rugby in the Wanganui union a shot in the arm.</span></p>
<p>Coaches Darren Malcolm and Carl Gibson have moulded together a squad of under-21 players from a few clubs and schools including several players who have not played rugby in recent seasons or are new to rugby.</p>
<p>The St John's Club sponsored Metro squad includes 10 players from last year's school teams, nine who did not play in 2015 and a few who did not play locally last year.</p>
<p>The squad, captained by Ratana prop Keanu Puki-Kaa, a member of last year's Hurricane's Regional Youth Council Wanganui rep side, includes fellow under-20 rep loose forward Corbin Warren, who was also a Wanganui under-18 rep, plus lock Stefan Hannan and first five Hareangi Meihana, two under-18 reps.</p>
<p>With limited numbers of under-21 players it was virtually impossible for clubs in the union to field their own colts teams and as a result the best of the youngsters were drafted into premier or senior sides. This has added an extra dimension to the Tasman Tanning senior grade in recent years with the teenagers moulded in with older players, but it meant the just-out-of-school members were not playing together in a restricted age grade competition.</p>
<p>It is a problem area for all unions in the Mitre 10 Heartland competition.</p>
<p>To help overcome the situation the Wanganui union sanctioned the formation of the Metropolitan under-21 team and Manawatu agreed to the entry of the side into its colts' championship which also included nine Manawatu teams and the <strong>Wanganui High School 1st XV.</strong></p>
<p>The Manawatu teams are OB Marist Cuba and Rowe teams, Massey White and Blue, Massey Ag, Linton, Freyberg, Te Kawau and Feilding OB-Oroua.</p>
<p>Both Metro and <strong>WHS</strong> recorded sizeable opening round victories - Metro scoring 13 tries including four from fullback Terangatira Waitokia in an 81-12 victory over OB Marist Rowe at Spriggens Park and <strong>WHS</strong> beat Te Kawau 73-7 at Rongotea with first five Griffen Culver scoring a hat-trick in the 11-try scoring feast.</p>
<p>Second five Mitchell Millar kicked seven conversions.</p>
<p><strong>High School</strong>, fielding a mixture of experienced players - third year 1st XV members and promoted 2nd XV and Year 11 players - includes under-18 Wanganui reps Sheldon Pakenga-Manahira (winger), David Marriner and Chris Brewer (forwards) and under-16 reps Culver and forwards Kohit Coveney, Tom Healy and Phoenix Kairimu. Brewer was chosen to attend the Hurricane's under-18 camp.</p>
<p>The two local squads in the colts' championship this season are -</p>
<p>Metropolitan -<br />Backs: Terangatira Waitokia, James Anderson <span>(former WHS)</span>, Shayden Phillips <span>(former WHS)</span>, John Iro, Christopher Campbell <span>(former WHS)</span>, Hareanga Meihana (former WHS), Riley Culver <span>(former WHS)</span>, Christopher Ferguson, Karihi Potaka-Osborne <span>(former WHS)</span>, Caius Webber <span>(former WHS)</span>, Robert Pickery <span>(former WHS)</span>, Shayde Chadwick-Waitokia <span>(former WHS)</span>, James Dorgan <span>(former WHS)</span>.<br />Forwards: Kanu Puki-Kaa (<span>former WHS -&nbsp;</span>capt), Sean Morahan <span>(former WHS)</span>, Laurence Webber <span>(former WHS)</span>, Stefan Hannan <span>(former WHS)</span>, Sean van der Lubbe, Hoani Ririnui, Corbin Warren <span>(former WHS)</span>, Jesse Iro, Jack Hughes, Bobby Lambert, Tom Gibson <span>(former WHS)</span>, Justis Manley-Green <span>(former WHS)</span>.<br />Coaches: Carl Gibson and Darryl Malcolm.</p>
