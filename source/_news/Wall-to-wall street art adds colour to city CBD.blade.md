<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Whanganui's inaugural street art festival gets under way on Thursday morning with international and New Zealand-based artists working throughout the lower CBD.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The visiting artists landed on Monday and have spent three days getting to know the area, starting with a pirate-themed welcome cruise on the Whanganui River.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Walls is being held over four days with eight artists creating original street art work on fresh walls in the lower two blocks of the CBD.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One of it's organisers, Simon Ormerod, said it was a great opportunity for the public to watch street artists in action.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The lead up has been super smooth," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had an amazing trip on the river, the Wairua and it was a really nice way for everyone to relax into Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ormerod said the artists were settled in and were ready to get to work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They've been blown away, having a look around and a look at some of the studios. They're always rearing to go."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Artists will be working from about 7.30am to early evening through to Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"[It will] give people a fascinating insight into street art processes. We've timed the street art festival to coincide with the second Open Studios weekend so people can add visits to the eight walls to their tour programme," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Town Centre Regeneration project manager Ellen Young said Whanganui had a vibrant arts scene and Whanganui Walls would bring "some of the colour out of the art galleries and into the streets".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Street art is a great way to rejuvenate our town centre as it evokes an emotional response and stimulates discussion, creating connections between people," Young said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A programme has been put in place to give seven local student artists in years 12-13 or in tertiary study the chance to be mentored by the Whanganui Walls artists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Selected student artists will be paired with a street artist on Thursday and Friday to learn skills and techniques.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brochures for the Whanganui Walls street art festival are available at the i-SITE Visitor Information Centre at 31 Taup≈ç Quay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui District Council arts advisor Riah King-Wall said council was keen to support Whanganui Walls and Whanganui &amp; Partners with the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A key goal in the council's proposed arts and culture strategic plan is to promote engagement in the arts for everyone in our community, and street art really fits well with that," she said.</p>
