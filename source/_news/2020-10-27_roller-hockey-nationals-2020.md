Past and present students of Whanganui High School came together over the holidays to compete at the Roller Hockey Nationals held in New Plymouth.

The Wanganui Roller Hockey Club came home from the Nationals with medals in every division they entered, which included nabbing the Gold with our Under 14 Division.

**Past students Mitchell Lockett, Cody Lockett, Jimi Blinkhorne along with present Y12 Student, Wilson McKee competed in the Premier Division bringing home silver.**

**Current Students, Connor Alderton (Y10), Amelia Neale (Y11) and Wilson McKee (Y12) along with past student Brodie Hurndell,  competed together in the Under 17s Division and Second Division bringing home Silver and Bronze respectively.**
