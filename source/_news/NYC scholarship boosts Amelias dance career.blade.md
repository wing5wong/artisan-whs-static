<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui dancer Amelia Chandulal-Mackay has been awarded an Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre scholarship.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 21-year-old Whanganui dancer jetted off to the United States about a month ago to take up an independent study programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But that has just become a whole lot cheaper having successfully auditioned to be part of the school's scholarship programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scholarship is worth about $16,000 which covers all the fees.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So it's saving a huge amount of money for my family which is really good," Amelia says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was very relived actually because it definitely wasn't the best audition I'd done and I actually came out feeling frustrated about it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ballet dancer has recently spent six months back in Whanganui after stints in Milwaukee and Orlando.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While home she performed in&nbsp;<em>Maleficent</em>&nbsp;which was produced by the Wanganui Ballet and Dance Academy in April.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Amelia is currently living in the lower east side of Manhattan and was enjoying New York life.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a huge change from Whanganui, obviously. But it's been really exciting, there's so much happening and so many people."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She decided to got back to study at the New York based school to expand her training in contemporary dance.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre has about 3500 students across different divisions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wanted to study more modern and contemporary styles," Amelia says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Ballet is the foundation of basically every style. I've had a lot of ballet training but not a lot of modern and contemporary training.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So I just wanted to get as strong as possible with that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There is an option audition for further years of scholarship but Amelia would prefer to go back to work for a dance company.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't have preference, I just want a job somewhere. I'm not really fussed about where as long as I'm dancing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scholarship starts at the end of August and Amelia will be home for a few days over Christmas.</p>
