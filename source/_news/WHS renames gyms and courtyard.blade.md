<p><br />Whanganui High School has changed the names of some of its buildings and taken on additional names for others.</p>
<p>Vogel Gym has been renamed Te Ihi, Seddon Gym has changed to Te Wehi, and Reeves Gym is now known as Te Mana.</p>
<p>In a school newsletter, principal Martin McAllen said the new names translated to excitement, awesome and prestige.</p>
<p>The Ballance Courtyard will be changed to The Courtyard, while the Deans' House won't be changed but will adopt Te Whare KaiƒÅrahi into the name.</p>
<p>He said there was a consultation process which included school staff, students and parents.</p>
<p>When contacted by the&nbsp;<em>Chronicle</em>&nbsp;for more information and comment on the name changes, the school said McAllen was not available for comment until later in the week.</p>
<p>"Given the purpose of the gymnasiums, these are accurate reflections of the results that are produced," McAllen said in the newsletter.</p>
<p>"Not just sporting results but also parent/teacher conferences, collective gatherings and so on."</p>
