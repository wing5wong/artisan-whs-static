<p><strong>The Visual and Performing Arts Departments ended the year on a high note! &lsquo;A world of Stars&rsquo; was the theme for a wonderful night at the Royal Wanganui Opera House, celebrating the successes, and contributions students have made.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Internationally acclaimed poet Leonel Alvarado was in the house, a prominent Latin American poet. He has written award-winning collections of poems in both Spanish and English, and was runner-up in the Casa de las Americas Prize which is Latin America&rsquo;s equivalent of Britain&rsquo;s Booker Prize or the United States Pulitzer Prize. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Earlier this year, Whanganui High School was proud to be involved in a collaboration with Latin American singer/songwriter, Emmy-winning, R&oacute;mulo Castro. While here, he was impressed with the strength and pride he saw among young people of the Whanganui River, and leapt at the chance to return a month later to work with us on a song he had written, which talks about sharing stories between his country and ours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The song, called <em>El Sur que Soy / The South that I Am,</em> was presented to the audience.<em> </em>&nbsp;You can find it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIsD228bbNM">YouTube</a>!&nbsp; We are now world famous!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also in the house, as guest performers, were &ldquo;Drones&rdquo; Three ex WHS students - Isaac Chamberlain, Ethan Coleman and Adam Robinson perform in this nationally acclaimed heavy rock band and they certainly got the house rockin&rsquo; &ndash; you can view the selfie with our audience on their facebook page</strong></p>
<p><strong>The night also belonged to the Cultural prefects who did a stunning job presenting the awards and setting the scene with amass of ivy, fairy lights and giant globes.</strong></p>
