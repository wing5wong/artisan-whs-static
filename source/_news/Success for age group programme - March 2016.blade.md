<p><strong>GOT YOUR BACK: The Whanganui Under-17 girls celebrate winning their inaugural games as a team at the weekend. Five of the team are students from Wanganui High School: front row, from left to right; Montel Vaiao Aki, Rachel Cranch, Maarie Mareikura-Ellery and Maia Ramis and back row, third from left, Dharma Jurgens.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>THE PUSH to get age representative basketball back on the map in Whanganui is paying dividends after the two new-look under-17 squads had success in Paraparaumu on Saturday.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>After the first open training session in late January organised by the Whanganui Basketball Association, the girls and boys under-17 teams were formed, along with a boys under-19 squad.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>They have been training four times a week with 6am starts on Tuesdays and Thursday's, followed by Friday gym sessions and more Saturday squad training.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Paraparaumu, the Whanganui under-17 girls, who are actually aged 12-15, beat both Levin and Kapiti under-15 to win their mini-tournament.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Under-17 boys, coached by Anthony Brown, played in a larger tournament and won both their pool games, before meeting the strong Manukura squad in the final.</span><br /><span>Spokesman Paul Berridge said Manukura were a strong, well-drilled squad from that chartered school, and the new Whanganui team lost by nine.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The under-17 girls did well to beat Levin 40-36 in their first game, coming back from 15-1 down at quartertime.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Coach Taare Henry said the girls had been nervous about playing a competitive tournament for the first time, and the Levin supporters were creating a lot of noise - cheering every bucket.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"I got them together and said, 'all this, that cheering, it's all superficial. Keep your head in the game'."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Whanganui then reversed the score in the second quarter to tie the match 16-16, and captain Maarie Mareikura Ellery went on a 12-point scoring burst in the second half to help seal the win.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Playing forward or guard, Maia Ramis also played well but Henry said it was a true team effort.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"One of the things they always say is, 'I got my girl's back'."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The under-19 boy's team under coach Ross Cronshaw will have their first hit out together this weekend.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Whanganui teams will play in the Mel Young Classic, being held in Tauranga and Rotorua over Easter Weekend.</span></span></p>
