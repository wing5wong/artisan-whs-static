<p><strong>Former WHS student Timothy Rowe at Parliament where he has spent a week being a Youth MP.</strong></p>
<p>Timothy Rowe has a new found respect for New Zealand's MPS.</p>
<p>Until he spent a week as a Youth MP for Whanganui had no idea how hard they worked.</p>
<p>"I just have so much respect for them now. They are very busy people."</p>
<p>Timothy, a former Whanganui High School student now studying law, said he was particularly indebted to Whanganui PM Chester Borrows for his time and guidance.</p>
<p>"It was the most amazing experience. I didn't know what to expect and now I would recommend it to anybody."</p>
<p>Timothy and the other 120 Youth MPs spent time in select committees, listening to Question Time in Parliament and having their own discussions in the debating chamber.</p>
<p>His own speech was advocating for the legalisation of euthanasia.<br />He also found the select committee work engrossing.</p>
<p>He was attached to the commerce select committee which was discussing digital technology in New Zealand and public access to a good service.</p>
<p>"It was all totally enjoyable though really stressful."</p>
<p>"We were busy rushing round and trying to complete everything."</p>
<p>He spent quite a bit of time with Mr Borrows, going to meetings and events and has also driven round the Whanganui electorate with the MP.<br />"It gave me a good idea of what MPs have to do."</p>
<p>And the 64 million dollar question - does he want to be an MP?<br />"Everyone asked me that. I don't know. It would be an exciting thing to do as a job. And if I every had such an opportunity that would be amazing."</p>
