Congratulations to our WHS students who competed in the NZ team Championships during the school holidays.  Ainsley Zeng, Kaylin Hoang and Demi Fu played for Whanganui U17 team and received a bronze medal. The first medal for a Junior Whanganui team in over a decade! 

Mehar Sinha played in the U15 team. Although her team didn't win a medal, Mehar had an outstanding individual performance, winning every single game (18 in total).

Well done girls!
