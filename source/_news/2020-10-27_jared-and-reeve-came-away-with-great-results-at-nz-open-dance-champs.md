**Jared Sim (18) and Reeve Watson (14) competed in the 70th New Zealand Open Dance Championship at the Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua over Labour Weekend. They battled it out in the Youth and Adult categories, attaining two 3rd and one 2nd placings following a number of rounds and semifinals.**

The Youth category (16 â€“ 19) had 23 highly trained and energetic dance couples from as far North as Auckland and South as far as Gore. Adults (16 - 35) numbered 24 couples from Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Gore.

A great dance competition showcasing the best Standard, New Vogue and Latin American dancers over a number of age groups including professional couples.

Due to Covid 19 restrictions, the event also benefited with International Adjudicator Karen Hardy (England) acting as one of the judges for the two days of the 2020 New Zealand Dancesport Championship.

Well done to you both! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•ºðŸ’›ðŸ’š
