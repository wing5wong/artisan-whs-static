<p><br />Whanganui High School students will battle out their talents on stage to create a night filled with dance, drama and music.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Opera House will host the Performing Arts Concert, Battle of the Houses on Wednesday June 19 and Thursday June 20.</p>
<p>Kicking off at 7pm, the night will showcase the best of the best of the school, head of music and performing arts coordinator, Jeanette Jones said.</p>
<p>"It gives students that platform of the Whanganui opera house stage and an opportunity to be on a professional stage."</p>
<p>Due to not having a school production this year, the school introduced the battle of the houses which will still combine the arts.</p>
<p>The night will include 30-60 students from each house performing in chamber music groups, dances, drama students, Kapa Haka, Pacifica and groups from the Smokefree Rockquest.</p>
<p>"The timing fits in perfectly after our extremely successful Smokefree Rockquest and Chamber Music groups performances," Jones said.</p>
<p>Being partially a house event, students who are not involved in performing but come along to watch the concert will get a house point, along with their parents.</p>
<p>Michael Franklin Browne from Head Like a Hole will judge on Wednesday evening while Miss World New Zealand 2018 and Miss World Oceania 2018, Jess Tyson will be there to judge on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Text voting will be available for the audience to vote for their favourite group out of 18 items performed each night over two acts.</p>
<p>A percentage of the text voting along with the judges' votes will go towards the houses placing in first, second, third and fourth place.</p>
<p>"I'm very very excited for the calibre of acts that will be performed, there's not one person that will come to the show and be disappointed," Jones said.</p>
<p><strong>* Tickets can be purchased at the Whanganui High School Student Centre or the Whanganui Opera House, Students/Children $8 and Adults $10.</strong></p>
