Over the past few weeks our Community prefects have been hard at work raising awareness about the RELAY FOR LIFE in aid of cancer research. They also put on a couple of sausage sizzles and held a raffle to fundraise. This all culminated in the Relay for Life at Cooks gardens on Saturday 22nd March. Over the course of the day so many students popped by and walked for us, and so many students raised money through donations and sponsorship. Thanks to all the students for your enthusiasm and dedication. Thanks also to the teachers and parents who stopped by to say hello, it was great to have your support. Congratulations to the Community prefect team. In total we raised over $5000 which is a fantastic achievement. Well done everyone at WHS, it was great to see such spirit. Thanks to St Johnâ€™s Four Square for the donation towards the Sausage Sizzle, and Unichem Pharmacy for the Raffle Hamper.
