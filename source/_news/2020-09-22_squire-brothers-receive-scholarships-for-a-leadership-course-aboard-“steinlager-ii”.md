The Blue Light Junior Policing Unit (a program run by volunteer policemen in their spare time) gifted two scholarships, for a leadership course aboard “Steinlager II”, to the Wanganui Sailing Club.  **The Wanganui Sailing Club awarded these scholarships to Luke and Caleb Squire for showing leadership in the club environment.**

The leadership course is a five night trip around the Hauraki Gulf on Steinlager II which is one of the most influential boats in New Zealand racing history.  Steinlager II was captained to victory in the Whitbread Around The World Race by Sir Peter Blake who is seen as the greatest sailor to ever live by many New Zealand sailors.  The New Zealand Sailing Trust took over the care of two of Sir Peter Blake's boats and refitted them to offer leadership experiences to New Zealand teenagers.

Luke and Caleb have been sailing since they were seven and learnt the basics on Pauri Lake.  Since then they have sailed on Whanganui river and have travelled around the North Island attending regattas and coaching sessions with Russell Coutts.
