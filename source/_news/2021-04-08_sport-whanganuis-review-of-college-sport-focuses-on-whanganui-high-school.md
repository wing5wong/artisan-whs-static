##### WHS Swimming Sports  
Our school swimming sports this year at Whanganui High School were a success. It was great to see our school swimmers that belong to our Whanganui swimming club showing their hard work. House relays were the highlight of the day and it was awesome to see all our students showing school spirit.

With the Whanganui Secondary School champs being delayed until Term 3 our Whanganui High School team is looking promising because most of the team belongs to our Whanganui Swimming Club. With all the training and hard work they will be putting in leading up to the champs Whanganui High School will be ready to bring some competition.

##### Softball  
Two high school teams were entered into the Whanganui Secondary School Softball Competition held on Monday nights. One was the WHS Junior Boys team, which placed placed fourth. The WHS Gold team was a mixed team that had to battle Whanganui City College, Whanganui Girls, WHS Juniors and Te Kotahitanga (Mixed Kura Team).

The Gold team went into the final game against a tough Cullinane College team, and pipped Cullinane for the title by one run 9-8.  
WHS Juniors MVP – Devon Maihi  
WHS Gold MVP - Nathan Procter

##### Maadi Cup – Rowing  
This year Whanganui High School took a squad of 29 rowers to the New Zealand Secondary School Maadi Cup Regatta held at Lake Karapiro. We had two crews in the A Finals - our U16 coxed quad of Reeve Watson, Victoria Soutar, Awen Emmett, Eliza Maxey and coxswain Campbell Monk, and first-year novice boys in the U18 novice coxed quad Dan Guan, Eli Kuehne, Petera Rogers, George Hughes and coxswain Campbell Monk.

Our juniors had a great day too with Emily Hutchins taking the 100m/200m sprint double and the 4x100m as part of a relay team. Also, in the junior girls Aria Bannister won the triple and long jumps as well as taking 3rd in the shot.

Cody Campbell dominated the junior throws with titles in the javelin and discus as well as second in the shot put. Overall a fantastic day and a great way to celebrate the fifth year of the Athletics pathway programme, which will culminate this December with the "Party at the Park" at the Secondary school nationals in Inglewood. WHS is in line for its best year ever at nationals and the team is looking forward to hosting past and present athletes and supporters for a big weekend of fun and performance.
