<p>A Whanganui make-up artist is making her big debut by vlogging.</p>
<p>Nika Steele is one of six New Zealanders to make it into the top 30 Australasia Face Awards.</p>
<p>It is competition where participants submit a YouTube make-up tutorial video and compete to become the Beauty Vlogger of the year. The winner gets $10,000 worth of prize money and a trip to Los Angeles to watch the US edition.</p>
<p>The competition has been running annually in the United States for the past six years and this year is the debut of Australasia edition.</p>
<p>The 24 year old said she had always dreamed of entering the Face Awards but never had the courage to actually do it....until now.</p>
<p>"When I found out I had made the top 30, I cried and ran around the house in disbelief. I sat there dreaming about this for so long."</p>
<p>On Friday the theme for the second round will be announced and participants will have two weeks to submit their next vlog.</p>
<p>The top 15 will be selected on a public voting forum. After that, make-up artists will submit a third video and the top six will be flown to Melbourne for a live show where they will compete for the final winner.</p>
<p>Miss Steele said if she won she would use the money to start her own business in Whanganui.</p>
<p>"It would give me the kick-start I need to start working as a full-time freelance make-art artist out of Whanganui and further my qualifications to eye lash extensions," she said.</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student completed a certificate in beauty therapy at UCOL and later a certificate in fashion make-up in Auckland.</p>
<p>Before she entered the competition she had never made make-up vlog.</p>
<p>"I am a part-time freelance make-up artist but I had never made or edited a video before. I taught myself with the help from Caleb and Abbi Kingi."</p>
<p>Miss Steele's next vlog will be open for voting on May 18. To view Miss Steele's entry vlog or to subscribe to her channel view below:</p>
