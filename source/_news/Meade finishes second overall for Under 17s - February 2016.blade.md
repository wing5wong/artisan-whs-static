<p><strong><span>(PHOTO CREDIT - STEVE CAUDWELL)&nbsp;</span>WHANGANUI waterskiier / WHS student Lily Meade finished second overall for the Under 17 girls division for her Oz/Kiwi team in the international series against Australia at Lake Karapiro's Piarere yesterday.</strong></p>
<p>The series started on Thursday and finished yesterday for the Under 14, Under 17 and Under 21 skiers, who competed in two rounds each of tricks, jumps and slalom.</p>
<p>Lily Meade's older brother Brent (former WHS student) was chosen for the Under 21 team to compete in just the jumps and slalom.</p>
<p>After a rough start in the slalom on Thursday, Lily Meade came back strongly - finishing first in the tricks and third in the jumps, where she set a new personal best of a 32m leap.</p>
<p>Father Simon Meade said his daughter had a better second round in the slalom to finish fourth, which meant she came second overall for the girls Under 17 division "by a very small fraction".</p>
<p>"She contributed well for the team [points] event."</p>
<p>However, it was expected the Australians had won the series when the final points were tallied for all 48 competitors late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Brent Meade did not go so well in slalom, but came sixth in the jumps, where he made a personal best of 45.6m. The Australians were strong in this event, with Joshua Wallent reaching an outstanding 61.9m with one leap.</p>
