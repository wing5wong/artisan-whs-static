<p><span>Embarking on aboricultural apprentice training are (from left) Kieron Te Awhe, Richard Te Ngahue (Tree Truck director), Wiremu Hipango, Dom Steenstra (Primary ITO training adviser) and former WHS student Matthew Walker.</span></p>
<p><br />Three new Whanganui apprentices are enrolled in a programme to help them progress from "groundies" to crew supervisors in the aboricultural industry.</p>
<p>Kieron Te Awhe, Wiremu Hipango and Matthew Walker work for Tree Truck, owned by Richard and Lynn Te Ngahue, and are the first apprentices in the Whanganui, ManawatÅ« and Taranaki region to be signed up as New Zealand Apprentices in the new Primary ITO (PITO) arboriculture programme.</p>
<p>The programme, designed by PITO and endorsed by the arboricultural industry, provides a clear framework of progressive on-the-job training for the range of roles in the industry.</p>
<p>"Communication skills and team work are embedded in the new programme which is vital for operating a successful business," said PITO training adviser Dom Steenstra.</p>
<p>Richard and Lynn Te Ngahue said they embraced apprenticeship training as part of their business philosophy.</p>
<p>"We encourage and support our staff to gain relevant qualifications; however, the driving force behind the study has to be from the apprentices and their passion for gaining the skills and knowledge," Richard Te Ngahue said.</p>
<p>Steenstra will support the apprentices through goal setting and sequencing study to provide logical career progression from "groundie" to crew supervisor.</p>
<p>PITO has developed resources to support studies and a robust system to verify and assess each of the unit standards.</p>
<p>Richard Te Ngahue is registered as an assessor to sign off the skills and knowledge and the new apprentices will collect additional evidence.</p>
<p>Several units are supported through off-job training courses.</p>
