<p><span>Eventual winner Taris Harker (83), second-placed Andrew Mowlem (56) and bronze medallist Whanganui paddler and former WHS student <strong>Toby Brooke</strong> in fierce competition throughout the national open men's 10km championship.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui paddlers dominated the Canoe Racing New Zealand kayaking series winning an outstanding seven national titles and several minor medals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After the completion of a series of 10km points races at various regional locations around the country, Canoe Racing NZ hosted the final race of the series at Blue Lake in Rotorua at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Doubling as the National 10km Championships both the series championships title and the title of National Champion were up for grabs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The series results were accumulated over a points system with the athletes best three results counting, however, to win the 10km Championship and to claim the national 10km title, the athlete had to win in Rotorua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">By the end of the race on Saturday the Whanganui Kayak group, a division of the Whanganui Multisport and Triathlon Club, managed to amass nine podium finishes out of 12 potential categories contested. And of those nine podium spots seven were national titles, one was silver and one bronze.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To add to the national championship titles the kayakers also won 10 series top three places, seven of which were national series titles with balance being second place spots.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For most of the race the conditions were idyllic with Blue Lake remaining calm for all but two laps of the triangular course," club spokesman Brian Scott said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This seemed to suit the Whanganui group who haven't had exposure to the windy racing that sometimes prevails at the longer events, especially over the winter months."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Scott said particularly pleasing was the great results spread across the age groups with a nice mix of female and male paddlers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Zane Mills-Nossiter started the day well winning the U13 title and at the other end of the spectrum former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Erica Tanner</strong> won the open women's title with <strong>Toby Brooke</strong> taking the bronze medal in the Open Men's," Scott said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although both masters competitors Scott and his wife Robyn won both the female and male Open Multisport Division. In between these results were equally impressive performances with <strong>Sophie Brooke</strong> winning the female U16 title, <strong>Jack Clifton</strong> winning the U16 male title and <strong>Liam Lace</strong> the U18 male title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The silver was won by <strong>Lucas Thompson</strong> in the U16 males. The other three team members <strong>Cameron Russell</strong>, George Pedley and Emily Caird all performed well, Scott said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now the series has finished the club has a couple of recovery days before returning to training and preparing for the first of the National Sprint Regattas.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The sprint regattas are expected to be tough competition with the sport currently performing better internationally than ever before," Scott said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Recent Junior and U23 Championships saw the best results at that level, including a double world U23 title to Amie Fisher (Hawkes Bay) with the U23 men also making two A finals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To add to the excitement of the first regatta there will be a new style of racing where all single boat racing will be completed in divisions with a knockout competition to determine finalists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This gives newcomers to the sport the ability to race athletes of similar speed irrespective of age and then join into teams."</p>
