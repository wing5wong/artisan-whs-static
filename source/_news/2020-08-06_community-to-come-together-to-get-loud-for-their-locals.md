As part of their campaign, Jigsaw Whanganui have put out an open invitation to their event on Saturday, 1 August 12-2.30pm, at Majestic Square, Whanganui. The event is free for everyone to attend - a real treat with local band, Whiskey Mama playing. Whiskey Mama have kindly donated their time and talents to this event and are sure to put on a fabulous end of winter gig! Amongst the music, a group exercise will be run to highlight the inequalities our people face in the community, followed by a discussion on how we can challenge these inequalities together.

Jigsaw Whanganui is calling for locals to get behind their own and support their community as the recent effects of COVID-19 further ingrains inequality. Their campaign, ‘Look After Your Local,’ launched this month with the aim of increasing awareness and raising funds to help Jigsaw Whanganui continue to support local families and whanau.

If you are ready to take responsibility for your own community, follow ‘Look After Your Local’ on Facebook or Instagram and get along on the 1st! We all have a role to play in ending inequality in our community.

Jigsaw Whanganui engages intensely with whanau and families in their own homes. They assist families who are challenged by complex needs, disability, inadequate resources, violence, trauma, learning impairments, relationship breakdowns and more to build resilience and hope.

Jigsaw Whanganui says the effects of COVID-19 have seen an extra strain on grants which fund their services. Chief Executive, Tim Metcalfe, has been encouraged by the community’s willingness to step up and support local businesses in the aftermath of the lockdown, and hopes the same commitment can be made to supporting local charities.
