<p>The 2015 pro tour has started on a positive note for Wanganui expat Nick Gillespie and former WHS student.</p>
<p>His 10th place finish in the Oates Victoria Open, which wrapped up on Sunday, was only four shots behind winner Richard Green (Australia) and netted him $7381.</p>
<p>Gillespie began steadily enough on the Beach Golf Links at Barwon Heads near Geelong, shooting two-under par 70s in his first three rounds.</p>
<p>But he made his move up the leader board with a six-under 66 on the final round in the first PGA Tour of Australasia tournament of 2015.</p>
