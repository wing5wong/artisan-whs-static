<p>With winter on its way Whanganui's Windermere Berry Farm has had its last open weekend for the season.</p>
<p>Its cafe has been busy and its berry-laden pancakes have become a legend.</p>
<p>The farm's workers harvested 50 per cent more strawberries this season than the last, owner Tony Boswell said - but it hasn't all been rosy.</p>
<p>"It's been a challenging season, because of the lack of summer. It's really tested our growing skills."</p>
