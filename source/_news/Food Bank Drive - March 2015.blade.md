<p><span>The Community Prefects Food Bank drive for the City Mission Wanganui was very successful. the drive which was done over week 6, produced just over 900 cans and non-perishable goods. we are extremely happy with the result as this was run as a donation. On the Friday we collected the goods from form classes with the help of 6 amazing year 12s. Thank you to all those who donated, and congratulations to the year 9 cohort who donated the most.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I'd like to thank Mr Andrews for the trollies we were able to use to help us collect the goods. Mr Martin who delivered the trollies for us, Also Justin and the team at the Wanganui City Mission who picked up our large load from school.</span></p>
