On 24 September, we took a group of 5 to the Whanganui School Pupil Chess Championship 2020, held at Churton School.

Though the tournament was smaller than normal, our students did an excellent job, claiming the highest awards. 

Shawn Lamong came in 1st place overall, with Zach Paikea in 2nd and Jihoo Kim in 3rd. Sam Gray took 1st place for the Under 16s and Toby Clark took 1st place for the Under 14s. 

A great day was had by all.
