Last Friday our Community Prefects held Pink Shirt day - a mufti day with an anti bullying focus. 

This included a 'Cookie for a Compliment' which was a huge success with message boards filled and many smiles. 

Students were required to contribute a gold coin to wear mufti, and we are pleased to announce that over $1000 has been donated to Women's Refuge Whanganui.
