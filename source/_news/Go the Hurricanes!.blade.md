<p>These ardent Hurricanes fans from Whanganui are among the thousands heading to Westpac Stadium this weekend for the Super Rugby final against the Lions.</p>
<p>Ready to support the side are from left, Alex Robinson (WHS student), Niamh Flower <span>(WHS student),</span>&nbsp;Paul Kenny (PK), Kim Flower, and Imogen Flower <span>(WHS student)</span>.</p>
<p>The five are part of a contingent of 11 Wanganui Rugby Football Union staff, family and friends heading down to Wellington for the game which will see the Hurricanes in the finals for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Last year they lost to the Highlanders.</p>
<p>The fans own sports will come first though: PK is playing squash and Niamh, Alex and Imogen have netball to play, Niamh in Palmerston North, on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>And their picks for a Canes win?: Niamh (27-18), Alex (10-3), Imogen (28-16) PK (41-28) and Kim (32-17).</p>
<p>For those staying home, the game is on Sky Television with the build up from 6.30pm and kick off at 7.35pm and on Prime from 9.30pm.</p>
