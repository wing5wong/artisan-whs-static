Further to the Prime Minister’s announcement last night, our WHS Alert Level 2 Safety Plan is activated again.  

Please note:  All student and teacher trips outside of Whanganui City limits between 1 March and 5 March have been postponed until we move back to Alert Level 1; the Year 9 Parents’ evening on Tuesday, 2 March is postponed again to a future date; all House Assemblies have been cancelled between 1 March to 5 March.  If unwell, please stay at home.  I will be sending out a Newsletter to all caregivers/parents on Monday morning.

Take care.

Martin McAllen  
Principal  
Whanganui High School
