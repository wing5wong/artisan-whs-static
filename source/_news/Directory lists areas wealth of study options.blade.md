<p>Wanganui students are now able to browse the Directory of Learning Opportunities 2016 to find out more about tertiary level study and career services in Wanganui.</p>
<p>Students from Wanganui secondary schools had a look through the directory as they took a tour of UCOL classrooms yesterday.</p>
<p>The directory is available in digital and hard copy and is in its third year of print. It is produced by Wanganui District Council and UCOL's Collaborative group which looks at ways to provide training to those not engaged in employment, education or training.</p>
<p>The directory includes a variety of Whanganui education providers. It also includes a list of youth services and study resources.</p>
<p>Mayor Annette Main, chairwoman of the UCOL Taskforce, said: "A directory with all the options available helps promote local tertiary education to our young people after they've finished school as well as attracting people from other parts of the country to come to Wanganui to study.</p>
<p>"We've got a wealth of education providers in our district, more than most people probably know. Having all the options in one place is an invaluable resource, not just for school leavers who are seeking further learning opportunities, but for everyone on their learning journey.</p>
<p>"The directory also supports the 100% Sweet programme, which is a Mayoral Taskforce to ensure 100 per cent of young people are in employment, education or training."</p>
<p>Wanganui Tertiary Education Collective chairman Peter MacDonald, who worked with education providers to create the directory, said schools are already using the directory and "finding it a great tool".</p>
<p>"People from other regions who would like a similar tool have asked us how we worked together on the directory because it is perceived that education providers are competing for students. But every education provider in our district wants to work toward the greater good of young people and working in partnership is something Whanganui does well.</p>
<p>"We might consider developing an app in future so when information is updated the guide doesn't need to be redesigned and printed. "</p>
<p>The directory is available at www.wanganui.govt.nz/tertiary, at the Wanganui District Libraries and through schools and tertiary education providers.</p>
