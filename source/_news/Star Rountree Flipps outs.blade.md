<p class="element element-paragraph "><br />Bad lucked dogged Whanganui rider <strong>James Rountree</strong> in his final test in national junior ranks at the New Zealand Motocross Championships near Foxton at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph "><strong>Rountree</strong> was aiming for podium finishes in two classes in his final fling in the junior ranks and all was going well when he qualified fourth in both the 15-16 year 125cc and 14-16 year 250cc classes on what is colloquially known as Flipps track at Himatangi.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph "><span class="ellipsis">However, the teenager crashed in race one of his 125cc class damaging his ankle and ultimately ruling him out of contention for the rest of the championships.&nbsp;</span><span class="paywall">Rountree turns 17 in June, so moves up in grade for future competition.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">With Rountree sidelined four new champions were crowned at the 2019 New Zealand Junior Motocross Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">Rongotea's Seth Henson, Manukau's Cobie Bourke and Tokanui's Mitchell Weir respectively repeated national title wins, Henson adding the 12-14 years' 125cc crown to the 11-12 years' 85cc title he won in 2017, Bourke successfully defending his 14-16 years' 85cc title and Weir adding the 12-13 years' 85cc title to the 8-11 years' 85cc title he won in 2016.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">But for Pukekawa's Jack Dunlop, Tauranga's Madoc Dixon, Invercargill's Seth Morrow and Oropi's Levi Townley it was their first time on top of the podium at a New Zealand Junior Motocross Championships event, although Morrow had previously been a mini motocross champion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">Dunlop was in sensational form in claiming the premier 14-16 years' 250cc title, winning five of his seven races over the weekend, clinching that trophy ahead of Otautau's Jack Treloar and Dunedin's Grason Veitch, while Dixon had more of a battle on his hands in the 15-16 years' 125cc class, local hero Luka Freemantle giving him plenty to think about before he eventually won the title by just two points from the Palmerston North teenager.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">Morrow, only recently recovered from injury, won four of his seven races in the 8-11 years' 85cc class, winning the title by 11 points from Hamilton's Jack Coleman.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">Townley showed consistency counts as he finished no worse than sixth all weekend and took the new 8-11 years' 65cc title by 15 points from Auckland's Jack Ellingham, who rose up from fourth after day one to capture the runner-up spot. This class was a support class only last season, but now elevated to full championship status in 2019.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall"><strong>Troy Bullock</strong> was the best of the Whanganui riders finishing 10th overall in the 14-16 85cc championship class, while <strong>Ajah Sullivan</strong> was 5th overall in the girls support class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph paywall">Chase Williamson, 12th in the 8-11 85cc class, <strong>Alex luff Scott</strong>, 24th 14-16 250cc class and Finn Lennox, 11th in the 8-11 pro 65cc class, rounded out the Whanganui performances.</p>
