<p>ROCKY ROAD: Whanganui racer (and former WHS student) Richie Dibben (119) hunts down the leaders before getting the chop in the Asia Supermoto Championship in Newcastle, Australia at the weekend.</p>
<p>Whanganui racer Richard Dibben received the visitor's welcome when he took his place in the Asia Supermoto Championships in Newcastle, Australia last weekend.</p>
<p>The two-time New Zealand Suzuki Series Motard champion received a late call-up to race in the international field after current Suzuki Series motard titleholder Duncan Hart from Tauranga broke his collarbone.</p>
<p>Dibben had never raced in Australia before and nor had he competed on the sealed and unsealed track that made up the tight Newcastle circuit.</p>
<p>However, he came to grips with the street and carpark combination to qualify second fastest for the first of the two race series.</p>
<p>He finished third, but not without escaping a fair bit of argy bargy from the Australians.<br />"I was second most of the way and charging, but an Aussie rider behind me took me out of the race," Dibben said yesterday.</p>
<p>"Three laps in a row he tried to take me out and finally did. We both crashed and I got back up to finish third.</p>
<p>He then protested and the Australian officials upheld it. Initially they were going to dock me one place and put me back to fourth. I wouldn't have minded that, but in the end they penalised me 10 seconds, which was a big penalty for such a small, tight track. It put me back to seventh."</p>
<p>That meant Dibben was forced to start Sunday's final race from seventh on the grid.<br />'In that race I was taken out again by another Aussie. I managed to get back on again and I was close up behind one of the British riders. Unfortunately, he was having engine problems and his bike cut out and I had nowhere to go but straight into him. My bike got a bit mangled and ended my race - a bit disappointing really," Dibben said.</p>
<p>He ended the series 14th overall, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience.<br />"It was a really tight circuit and difficult to pass. I have never ridden in races with such aggression though. I've ridden in England and Italy and never experienced anything near as aggressive. I did enjoy the overall experience though."</p>
<p>The Whanganui motorcycle mechanic will now focus on the Suzuki New Zealand Series aiming to reclaim his motard title later this year.</p>
