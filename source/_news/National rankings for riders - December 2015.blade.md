<p><span>ALL DOWNHILL: Whanganui mountain bikers and WHS student Tyler Smith (left) and Blake Rountree finished fourth and fifth overall in their respective grades at the North Island Downhill Championship final round in Warkworth at the weekend.</span></p>
<p>A determined and daring ride in the final round of the North Island Downhill Mountain Bike championship in Warkworth on Saturday propelled Whanganui teenager Tyler Smith into fourth place overall despite missing a round. Smith, who did not compete at the penultimate round, had finished sixth and 16th in the first two rounds. He came into the final round at Dome Valley just north of Warkworth in ninth position hoping for a top 10 finish.</p>
<p>However, Smith produced an amazing ride to finish second overall on the day and move up to fourth overall for the series out of 30 riders.</p>
<p>In fact, Whanganui ended the competition with two riders in the top five nationally.</p>
<p>Blake Rountree, who was one of three riders in third equal coming into the final round, rode well against tough opposition to finish sixth in the final round, and fifth overall in the series out of 27 riders in his grade.</p>
<p>The track was dry and fast with big step up jumps down the track and the top five riders were only separated by 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Both boys move up a grade with Smith entering the U19 class and Rountree the U17.</p>
