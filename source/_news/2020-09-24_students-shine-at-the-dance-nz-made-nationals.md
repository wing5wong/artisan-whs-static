Dance NZ Made Interschool Nationals were held at the Regent on Broadway, Palmerston North on Saturday 19 September.

We had 3 Duos/Trios representing WHS at the National event.  A tough competition with schools representing from all over NZ. 

**Congratulations to Sophia and Olivia Bedwell placed 3rd in the National Opens category.  An outstanding result for the girls. Well done!**

Wonderful performances from all of our dancers.  The results didnâ€™t go our way but an incredible level of dance displayed from all.

**Congratulations to Emma Henare and Rebekah Phillips who were awarded top Regionals Soloists on the night. Well done!**
