<p class="element element-paragraph">Familiar storybook characters are dancing across the Royal Wanganui Opera House stage as they rehearse for their Christmas programme which opens tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Shirley McDouall School of Dance will present&nbsp;<em>Toyland</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>A Christmas Tale</em>&nbsp;and every dancer - from the smallest to the tallest - has a part.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some of the cast will dance more than one part like <strong>Leila Collinson</strong> who will dance as Mary one night and as the Spirit of the Past in&nbsp;<em>A Christmas Tale</em>&nbsp;the next.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Leah Aiono </strong>(WHS student)&nbsp;will dance the same parts on alternate nights and other dancers will also share different roles.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">School principal Melissa Tate said the rehearsals have been going well and everyone is excited about their performances.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The students have all worked really hard and it will be a great show."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Makenzie Tate, 14, will dance as Bo Peep and she has two sisters - Brooklyn, 13, and Kennedy, 7 - who will also be dancing in the show.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Tate said the two-part programme is filled with fun and vibrant Christmas-themed variations on the original tales.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Toyland</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>A Christmas Tale</em>&nbsp;Saturday, December 2 and Sunday, December 3 at 5pm. Tickets - adult $18, senior / Friends OH $16, child 3 years to at school $13. Book at Royal Wanganui Opera House.</strong></p>
