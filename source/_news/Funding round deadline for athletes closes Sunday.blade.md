<p class="element element-paragraph">The Mitre 10 Mega Future Champions Trust September funding round is open and the trust is calling for final applications before the round closes on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Future Champions Trust provides financial support to talented young athletes who have the opportunity to compete at international level in their chosen sport but may need financial assistance to make this possible.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The trust has been operating for four years and granted $44,000 to 40 individual athletes, assisting them in participating in international events like Olympic and Commonwealth Games, World Cups and other major events in their chosen sport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is great to be able to support the talented young people of our region to follow their dreams.
