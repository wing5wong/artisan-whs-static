<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui student Tokorangi Poa has won a national award for his art work - a print entitled Descendants of Paikea.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Whanganui High School student is the winner of the 2017 Wallace Secondary Schools Art Awards printmaking category.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Art teacher Graham Hall said Tokorangi's work was one of three Whanganui entries to make the final 30.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There were over 400 entries from secondary schools around New Zealand and another Whanganui High School student as well as a Whanganui Girls' College artist had their work selected for the top 30."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>High School's Lily Claypole</strong> and Girls' College student Elleira Tubayan also made the top 30 and their work will be exhibited at the Pah Homestead, TSB Bank Wallace Arts Centre, Auckland until November 5.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Hall said Tokorangi was a Year 12 student in his first year of print making.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He is an exceptional talent - he has taken to the medium very quickly," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The black ink print shows a reclining youth with eyes closed and apparently listening to something while his phone and headphones lie abandoned on the floor.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Outside, a group of tohorƒÅ (whales) swim by with the sun glinting off their backs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Paikea is the legendary ancestor of the Ngati Porou tribe who inspired Witi Ihimaera's 1987 novel and the 2003 film Whale Rider.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wallace Art awards were initiated by Sir James Wallace who began collecting New Zealand art, particularly that of emerging artists, in the 1960s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 1992 he transferred his collection to a newly formed charitable trust and continued to fund it so that it could continue to add to the collection and support the arts in New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each year, since 1992, the trust had has held annual art awards and The Wallace Secondary Schools Art Awards was started in 2012 to recognise and celebrate emerging New Zealand talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Students can submit an original creation in illustration, painting, photography and printmaking.</p>
