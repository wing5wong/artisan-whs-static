<p><strong>Day 2, 3 and 4 in Xiamen</strong></p>
<p>Dear parents,<span class="text_exposed_show"><br />Sorry for the late update about the trip. So far, I have to say everything goes really quite well. We had quite busy schedule in the past 3 days. Can not believe how time flies. Students becomes more familiar with the campus, participate every activity positively. Today we went to Xiamen No.1 middle school to visit. Our students represented our school, our country, and New Zealand high school students fantastically. I felt so proud to be their teacher. Everyone has taken lots of photos and videos they will share with you when we return.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">So far only small dramas such as broken skin under the feet (we walked a lot&nbsp;<span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f57/1/16/1f609.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></span>) , sore throat (might be the climate-- so hot outside about 30 degree today, and try air con in the room) upset tummy (might be too much new Chinese food&nbsp;<span class="_5mfr _47e3"><img class="img" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/f57/1/16/1f609.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" />)</span>&nbsp;but all sort it. No worries !</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Next a few days in Xiamen will be quite relax, all activities happen on the Xiamen University campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will become more confident in everything, such as getting to classroom, where to get meal and snacks and drinks, where is the gym and swimming pool etc in this 'New' place.</p>
<p>Then we will heading to Beijing.</p>
<p>Good night and keep in touch.</p>
