<p><strong>The Wanganui High School 1st XV is tied on 8 points at the top of the table with defending champions Massey White in the Manawatu McDonald's Colts division rugby championship.</strong></p>
<p><span>St Johns Club Wanganui Metro is limping to the semi-finals after injury and suspensions have dogged the team in recent weeks.</span></p>
<p>The two Whanganui-based sides in the Manawatu McDonald's Colts division rugby championship are right in the hunt for semi-final spots with three matches to play in the Top 6 competition.</p>
<p>The <strong>Wanganui High School 1st XV</strong> is tied on 8 points at the top of the table with defending champions Massey White, while the St Johns Club Metro Colts are limping to the semi-finals in third on 5 points.</p>
<p>Old Boys Marist Cafe Cuba Lightning Dolphins looks likely to fill the fourth spot in the semi-final with 4 points. Old Boys Marist Fitzherbert Rowe Colts are on zero points, while Massey Ag is on -2 after several defaults.</p>
<p><strong>WHS</strong> had a convincing 28-10 win over Marist Fitzherbert Rowe on Saturday, while Metro suffered an unfortunate 25-19 loss to Massey White.</p>
<p>Carl Gibson, who co-coaches Metro alongside Darryl Malcolm, said they were struggling to field a full complement of players on Saturdays with injuries and suspensions reducing numbers.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a bad game last Saturday. Massey White has not been beaten for a very long time, although both times we've played them this season we've managed to get within 7 points," Gibson said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We are struggling to have 15 or 16 available on Saturday at the moment and that makes it pretty difficult against such a strong side with a full list of replacements. Our main focus now has to be making the top four and then regroup and I'm confident we can achieve that."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>WHS</strong> manager Richard Bennett praised his players after injury struck against Marist Fitzherbert Rowe on Saturday.</p>
<p>"It was a very good win, especially after a couple of our forwards had to step up after injuries to some in the backline," Bennett said.</p>
<p>"<strong>Brayden Maua</strong>, who usually plays No8 and scored a try in that position in the first half, went on to the wing in the second spell and did very well. We had other changes too, including loose forward <strong>Chris Brewer</strong> who moved to lock. Our aim is to make the semi-finals and take it from there."</p>
<p>WHS was runner-up to Massey White in last season's championship.</p>
<p>Both Whanganui side travel to Palmerston North this weekend where Metro take on Marist Fitzherbert Rowe and WHS tackle the Dolphins.</p>
