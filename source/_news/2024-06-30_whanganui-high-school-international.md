 Exciting news! Earlier this month, Education New Zealand (ENZ) Viet Nam proudly hosted the 2024 New Zealand Schools Scholarships (NZSS) Awards Ceremony & Pre-Departure Briefing for this year's talented NZSS winners. They were honoured to have Mr. Scott James, New Zealand Consul-General & Trade Commissioner in Viet Nam, and Mr. Ben Burrowes, Regional Director - Asia Education New Zealand (ENZ), join them to present the scholarship certificates.

A special shoutout to Nguyen Minh An Pham, our Whanganui High School NZSS Scholarship recipient, who was in attendance. We can't wait to welcome her to our school in July! 

Check out the highlights from this event in the photos and video below!  #NZSS2024 #EducationNewZealand #ScholarshipWinners #FutureLeaders
