Well done to our students from Brazil who participated in the volleyball league this term.

Congratulations to WHS Team Brazil and WHS Pretty Princesses who played in the Grand Final of mixed Volleyball yesterday. The game finished as a draw. A lot of [](<>)fun had by all. Thanks to all of the WHS teams for their great sportsmanship over the term and also our WHS referees for helping out each week.
