<p>GOING GLOBAL: &nbsp;Former Wanganui woman and ex Wanganui High School student Megan Smith has been named head of global sales and marketing for software company TotalView Solutions.</p>
<p>A Wanganui woman who recently headed the Beat Bowel Cancer organisation, has been appointed head of global sales and marketing for software start-up company TotalView Solutions.</p>
<p>Megan Smith, the daughter of Tony Hawkins and Sue McNicol, was born and raised in Wanganui and got her secondary schooling at Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>Ms Smith said she was excited that a part of the company and its software will "in a very human way" be related to Wanganui.</p>
<p>As a member of the senior management team she will report to executive director Tony Lindsay.</p>
<p>She will have oversight of strategic business plan development and preparation of all marketing and sales functions necessary to launch TotalView Solution's product domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>"I am delighted that Megan will be joining our team. She shares our values and our focus on innovation, and she places a strong emphasis on the customer experience as we do," Mr Lindsay said.</p>
<p>"She has shown herself to be an excellent leader and achiever and works with intensity and grit as a game changer as her track record has proven."</p>
<p>Totalview Solutions was set up by Mr Lindsay and his wife Helen, after a lifetime spent in the not-for-profit sector in NZ and overseas. Both have worked for and with peace, environment, development, community, arts and human rights groups starting in the anti-nuclear movement in Europe in 1971.</p>
<p>They said their goal is to offer first to NZ and then global markets, a community engagement platform that is affordable for even the smallest group, but also big enough for the largest global not-for-profit organisation.</p>
<p>"We want to deliver the best available technology that allows even a small volunteer-based group to use the most sophisticated technology platform previously only available to large professionally staffed organisations," he said.</p>
<p>Ms Smith said the expertise and innovation of the company would have a significant impact on non-government organisations and eventually the health industry.</p>
<p>She joins Totalview Solutions after serving as chief executive officer of Beat Bowel Cancer where she led that charity through a major period of growth and awareness.</p>
<p>Before that she had developed a career in sales and marketing with multinational pharmaceutical companies and currently sits on various boards as a trustee and director.</p>
<p>After leaving high school she completed tertiary studies to qualify as a registered comprehensive nurse in New Plymouth. After studying she travelled extensively overseas.</p>
<p>"During time in Australia and the UK, my nursing practice was focused mainly on oncology which set the foundation for my return to NZ," she said.</p>
<p>Ms Smith regularly returns with her children to visit her parents.</p>
