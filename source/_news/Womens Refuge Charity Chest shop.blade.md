<p><span>Sara Owen, Lynda Armstrong and former WHS student Liberty Bracegirdle (middle) are among a number of women who have volunteered to help at the Women&rsquo;s Refuge Charity Chest shop, which opens this Saturday and will be selling top of the range clothing for the next three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span>Sara says, &ldquo;Women&rsquo;s Refuge is been close to my heart and I have always wanted to help out. When I saw the amazing Charity Chest shop earlier this year I volunteered for whatever&nbsp;</span><span class="text_exposed_show">they wanted me to do.&rdquo; That involves doing all the administration/paper work. With a background in being an independent consultant for Isagenix and also running a carbon brush business with her husband, admin work comes naturally.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Lynda says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having some time off recovering from cancer and I see volunteering for the shop as an opportunity to get involved with the community by being involved in a really worthy cause. I have three daughters and I&rsquo;m concerned about the impact of domestic violence on women. I encourage my daughters to be empowered and supportive of other women.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Liberty is Lynda&rsquo;s daughter and she has recently been travelling and working with young children in the USA. She is inspired by the fashion industry and one day is interested in owning a vintage thrift store, probably in Melbourne where she lives. After returning to Australia she came on to New Zealand to be part of the Charity Chest group of volunteers.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">&ldquo;When you look good, you feel better,&rdquo; says Lynda, &ldquo;and these clothes are bright, attractive and affordable.&rdquo; Sara adds, &ldquo;They would cost three times as much elsewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">After an opening on Friday at 6pm, where sample clothes will be modelled, the Charity Chest shop will open six days a week for three weeks from 10am to 4.30pm and 10am to 3pm on Saturdays. It is at the old Shanton Building on the corner of Victoria Ave and Ridgway Street.</span></p>
