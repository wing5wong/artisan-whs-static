At the end of July, 3 WHS Year 11 students, Robert Carter, Charlie Teager and Henry White played the Associação de Patinagem de Macau (APM) Tournament in Macau, China as members of the New Zealand Under 19s Rink Hockey team.

They will be playing at the Asia Games Tournament in Beidaihe, China where they will also be joined by. Year 13 Connor [](<>)Alderton. Good luck boys!
