Anzac Day services are returning to the Whanganui, Rangitikei, and Ruapehu districts this weekend, after last year's commemorations were cancelled due to Covid-19.

Whanganui's dawn parade, which has been held since 1935, will begin at 5.10am tomorrow outside the Davis Library, before the Anzac service begins at 5.30am at the War Memorial Centre forecourt.

The RSA's annual Poppy Appeal also returned in Whanganui last week, with volunteers stationed around town raising money to support current and former servicemen and women of all ages and all service backgrounds.

Whanganui RSA welfare officer Mac McCallion said there were 11 stands set up on Poppy Day last Friday.

"The cadets also did two on the Saturday, and the response from the community has been absolutely great," McCallion said.

"The take for the street appeal on the Friday was $5668."

McCallion said the RSA would be collecting poppy boxes, which were delivered to Whanganui retailers and businesses a fortnight ago, next week.

"There are 60-plus boxes out there in the community.

"People have also been given the opportunity to text their money to the RSA, so it will be a little while before we get our final total.

"From my point of view, I'm very happy. The cadets have done an exceptional job and they've also given us a hand down at the club, along with their unit commanders.
