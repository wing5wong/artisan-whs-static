<p><strong>CALL UP: Whanganui all-rounder Jess Watkin (WHS student) has been called into the White Ferns training camp at Lincoln in Christchurch next week after again signing with the CD Hinds.</strong></p>
<p>FIVE Whanganui cricketers have been signed to Central Districts franchises for the upcoming season.</p>
<p>Two former Whanganui representatives are among those named in the first 13 players to be offered contracts for the Devon Hotel Central Stags ahead of the 2016/17 season.</p>
<p>Ben Smith has signed for his fourth year with the team, while Tom Bruce now based in Taranaki, can also legitimately be claimed by the River City.</p>
<p>Bruce did his schooling in Whanganui and like Smith captained the Wanganui Collegiate School 1st X1 of his year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three Whanganui female players have been named in the Central Districts Hinds, including skipper Michelle Mitchell. <strong>She is joined by talented allrounder Jess Watkin, who has also been chosen to attend the White Ferns camp at Lincoln in Christchurch next week.</strong> Whanganui's Lisa Grant is the third from the River City to sign with the Hinds.</p>
<p>Mitchell said it was a massive honour to be named Hinds captain in what will be her fourth season.</p>
<p>"I was vice-captain last season to Kate Broadmore who has moved on to Canterbury where I originally came from. It's like trading places." Mitchell said yesterday.</p>
<p>Mitchell has juggled Whanganui representative duties with Hinds commitments for the past three years.</p>
<p>"It's a massive honour to be named captain and I'm looking forward to a top season," she said.</p>
<p>Individual training is already under way, but the Cricket Wanganui winter training programme begins with Term 3 in July 25. Further information can be provided by emailing info@cricketwanganui.co.nz.</p>
