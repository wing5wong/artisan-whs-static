<p>There was much to be excited about last Thursday's Whanganui Secondary Schools Cross Country over and above the glorious late autumn weather and the more than 10 percent increase in finishing numbers from 2016.<br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The team competitions were more keenly contested especially in boys' grades with particularly strong performances from</strong> <strong>Whanganui High School in senior boys where there were handsome winners in both three and six-to-score teams events</strong>.</p>
<p>This broke the long domination of Wanganui Collegiate School in the grade. <strong>The team of Liam Jones (1st - 2nd across the line in the combined junior/senior race), Connor Munro (2nd and 4th across the line) and Travis Bayler (3rd and 5th across the line) won the three to score by a wide margin of 13 points over WCS. WHS also won the six-to-score by 12 points.</strong></p>
<p>Whanganui City College were popular winners of the Junior Boys three-to-score team event and their success is a huge credit to Georgia Black who is working part time in a new initiative partnered by Athletics Wanganui, Wanganui Harriers and Sport Whanganui in a development role.</p>
<p>The participation of the WCC boys and their success is early encouragement for Black in her new role. The team of Riley Zimmerman (2nd), Byron Woon (4th) and Bradley Woon (8th) with a score of 14 points edged out WHS by one point with WCS a further five points in arrears.</p>
<p>WCS had a much stronger showing in the girls events winning five of the team titles available with Nga Tawa School breaking the domination at junior (under 16 level) with a win in the six-to-score event. In the Year 9 girls WCS took the trifecta with Ashleigh Alabaster (1st), Ana Brabyn (2nd) and Jessica Jones (3rd) a feat repeated in senior girls with Caitlyn Alabaster, Jane Lennox and Sarah Lambert although in that race combined with juniors<strong> Rebecca Baker (WHS) was first across the line.</strong></p>
<p>As I said a week ago most runners took part because they were in a team which gives the demanding individual sport a really genuine team element. It is for this reason I have opened this week with a team focus.</p>
<p>The championships did provide some impressive individual performances and winners go forward to the New Zealand Secondary Schools Championships in Christchurch on June 17 with some confidence. The Junior and Senior Girls race as indicated in Saturday's Chronicle provided the best race of the day with the battle between the younger <strong>Rebecca Baker</strong> and the leading WCS seniors Caitlyn Alabaster and Jane Lennox. The combination of grades helped provide the necessary competition for all three runners.</p>
<p><strong>Baker</strong>,<strong> with an impressive third and last lap of the Collegiate Golf course circuit, broke away to win the 3000 metre race (11:43.1) with a nearly 13 second winning margin.</strong> Alabaster was 8th in the NZ Schools junior event last year and former NZ Schools International Lennox was 15th in the senior NZ event last year <strong>highlights the excellence of Baker's performance.</strong></p>
<p>The boys combined junior/senior event provided another junior winner and also the biggest winning margin of the day. Liam Back (WCS) took hold of the race right from the gun and it was quickly apparent that the real battle was with the watch as Back attempted to break 13 minutes for the 3km journey.</p>
<p>He did not quite manage to do this but completed the 4.1km in 13.27.5 to win from <strong>senior winner Liam Jones (WHS)</strong> one minute 20 seconds in arrears. Back who had finished 4th at the North Island Schools 1500 metres travels to Christchurch with the knowledge that those who finished ahead of him on the track move to the senior grade in cross country and with the knowledge that his time last week gives him every chance of returning from Christchurch with a coveted top 10 certificate.</p>
<p>He also knows that he will in Christchurch be part of a string under 16 WCS team with Sam Thrupp third across the line and Year 9 run-away winner George Lambert who will move up to juniors to strengthen the team.</p>
<p>Ashleigh Alabaster (WCS) looks set to follow sister Caitlyn's footsteps with a commanding win in the Year 9 girls taking the title outrunning team mate Ana Brabyn. They will form the nucleus of a strong Year 9 team in Christchurch and will also prove valuable for the Whanganui Regional relay team which competes in the 5x2km relays on the day after the Cross Country Championship in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The WCS runners have to it all again tomorrow when they compete over the same Golf Course circuit. The races are also the final selection for the WCS team to Christchurch which will be named at the conclusion of the Friday competition.</p>
