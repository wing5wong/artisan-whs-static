<p><span>CUTTING A TRACK: Mangamahu teenager and Kiwi age group roller hockey rep Jimi Blinkhorne (centre) is heading offshore to hone his skills.</span></p>
<p>Paul Blinkhorne is never going to die wondering how far son Jimi will go in roller hockey.</p>
<p>The soon to be 16-year-old Whanganui High School student is passionate about the sport and his father, known widely as Blink, is backing him to the hilt.</p>
<p>Young Blinkhorne has already tasted international matchplay as an U14 and U16 New Zealand representative in trans-Tasman tournaments over the past two years.</p>
<p>But as his Kiwi team mates enjoy a holiday break before preparing for the nationals next year, Jimi Blinkhorne will continue to hone his skills at a week-long Australia Day club tournament in Melbourne on January 18-22.</p>
<p>And then in June next year Jimi and Blink plan a trip to Spain for a two-week international training camp.</p>
<p>"When we were at the trans-Tasman tournament in Auckland (October) I got chatting to the Australian U16 captain's father and told him the Kiwi guys had no tournaments until the nationals," Blink lamented.</p>
<p>"He said why didn't Jimi come and play at the Australia Day event and that he could stay at their place. I rang all the right people to gain a clearance and was told Jimi would be welcome. He will play for the Mordiallic Roller Hockey Club U17 team.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, the president of the New Plymouth club rang to say they were also sending teams and could Jimi play for their senior men's team. They have two NZ U21 reps and three NZ senior men reps in their side," Blink said.</p>
<p>The Mangamahu fencer said his son was passionate about the sport and was real keen to make a career out of it if at all possible.</p>
<p>"That's why I'm trying to give him every opportunity to gain experience to the very top level. The New Zealand association had looked at sending a squad to the international camp in Spain in June, but decided it was too close to our nationals.</p>
<p>"I'm keen to send Jimi anyway. It will be an amazing experience. Playing and mixing at top level of any sport opens doors, even outside of the chosen sport so it's got to be a winning move," Blink said.<br />Maki</p>
