More than 50 teams from all around New Zealand will be calling Wembley Park home this weekend for the 11-a-side football competition.

Games organiser Rachel O'Connor said it was the most number of people playing 11-a-side in number of years.

Almost 900 have registered for football, the most of any of the Masters Games sports by a significant margin.

"It's about 200 more than in 2019, so that is pretty awesome," co-organiser Tash Burney said.

Alongside her husband Scott, they have been the main organisers for the football side of Masters Games. She said there was a lot more planning than anticipated but all has run smoothly.

"It has gone pretty well. We have had a lot of help, it's all coming together," she said.

Whanganui Athletic are the hosts of the event, with members of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd XIs all giving up some of their time across the weekend to help where they can.

"It's awesome. It shows the togetherness of our club and how we can all help out."

Tash Burney said being able to run such a big event like the Masters shows that Whanganui has the facilities and space to run a tournament successfully.

"Wembley is a fabulous ground. It would be awesome to be able to host tournaments going forward.

"I'm definitely looking to get out there and watch some of those top teams go at it. The teams have been fantastic, we haven't had any issues."

Sports partner liaison Nicky Malipaard said it was always an awesome weekend at Wembley Park.

"It's a really big number of competitors. I think it comes down to the organisation and it's all gone really well. We have a good number of women's teams this year, which is awesome.

"It's always a really good atmosphere and a good weekend."
