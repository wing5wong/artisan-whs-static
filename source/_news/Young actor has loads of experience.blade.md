<p>FLASHER: &nbsp;Hamish Cameron in the zone.</p>
<p>Despite his youth, former WHS student&nbsp;Hamish Cameron already has an extensive theatrical background, which is hardly surprising given that he's director Glenn Cameron's son.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hamish recalls his first acting experience was when he was in a nativity play at St Peter's Church and his first speaking role as a liberating experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just went into the zone. It was my escape. I wasn't being me, I was someone else and I could do and say things I couldn't normally."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When Hamish acted alongside his father in&nbsp;<em>You Have The Right To Remain Dead</em>&nbsp;his character didn't like the character Glenn was playing so he had to say things to his father that he wouldn't normally say to him.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I always wanted to act with Dad. I considered it a privilege." For this role Hamish was nominated for the Best Newcomer Award in the Hawkes Bay Region. He's also proud that Rutherford Junior High School gave him the Drama Boy Award.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">" I think I might have been a bit of a naughty kid when I went there (Rutherford ) but they made me a Young Leader and then they made me Head Boy so that was quite an honour wasn't it?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One cast member of&nbsp;<em>The Last of the Summer Wine</em>&nbsp;had to withdraw, causing a gap in the cast and a necessary reshuffle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Dad told me that I had to play The Flasher and I was happy to do it. This role gets me out of my comfort zone. I mean I've never measured anyone's legs before and I've never kissed a man before! The Flasher doesn't want to go outside 'cos he knows the police are looking for him so they're trying to hide me in a hurry and they stick me in the serving hatch and tell everyone I'm a work of art. They keep patting me and it's really hard for me not to laugh."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Hamish has had a small part in a film shot in Wanganui,&nbsp;</span><em>Moon Tan</em><span>, which has whetted his appetite for more film work. Once&nbsp;</span><em>The Last of the Summer Wine</em><span>&nbsp;has completed its season he is off to Auckland to audition for another film role. We wish this engaging young man the very best of luck.</span></p>
