<p dir="ltr"><strong>Special congratulations to WHS students <strong>Ben Power,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Nanea Schurhammer&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong></strong>Ali Gammeter who won best overall delegation at the annual MUN day held at Whanganui Girls College on Friday 24 March.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Last Friday the Annual MUN day was held at Whanganui Girls&rsquo; College and our students really pulled out all the stops. We sent 10 teams representing Australia, Austria, Germany, Jamaica, Lebanon, Nigeria, Palestine, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. It was great to see our students dressed up in the national costume of the country they were representing. In addition students also decorated their tables and brought dishes of food from their chosen country. It is a great way for students from the Whanganui region to get together, share ideas and make new friends. The whole day is colourful and a lot of fun, especially at lunchtime when the students have a shared lunch.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The important reason for the day however is for students to learn about and debate policy issues on behalf of their chosen countries. To do this students must spend some time doing research and then, once the day begins, must enter into negotiations with other countries and lobby to get their resolutions passed. It is always a great learning experience for all of the students and they had a terrific day.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Congratulations must go to Germany (Cameron Allardice, Hugo Collins and Dylan Wilkie) and Spain (Clara Abel, Leila Collinson and Kaveh Safaei Torogh) who won Best Dressed and Best Food respectively. Special congratulations to Nigeria represented by Ali Gammeter, Ben Power and Nanea Schurhammer who won best overall delegation. Alister Hughes representing Palestine won for Best Overall Delegate with Ali Gammeter also picking up a Merit ward in this category.</strong></p>
