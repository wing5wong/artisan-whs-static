<p>SO CLOSE: Former WHS student Richard Dibben of Wanganui competing at the Whanganui Cemetery Circuit Motorbike Race, in the Supermoto category.</p>
<p>Wanganui's Richie Dibben did not let his disappointment show after his 18-point lead in the Supermoto class virtually disappeared after he finished 22nd of the 31 riders in race one.</p>
<p>"I had an electrical fault. Basically it was a coil wire. I was able to get going, but finished 22nd. I won the second race, but Duncan (Hart) pipped me by half a point to retain the title he won last year. If I had even finished 20th or better it may have gone my way. Yeah, it's disappointing, but there's nothing I can do about it," Dibben said.</p>
<p>Hart ended the day with a first and a third.</p>
<p>Dibben also missed setting a new lap record by the barest of margins in race two, however, visiting UK sidecar race Tim Reeves set a new target for this class.</p>
