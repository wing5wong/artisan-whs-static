<p class="element element-paragraph">They may have jostled each other to reach the swings at Kowhai Park once upon a time although they have no recollection of it now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Great Kiwi Bake Off</em>&nbsp;contestant Clayton Barnett and&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>contender Kerry Ranginui were both growing up in 1980s Whanganui but they met for the first time in Auckland last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great fun meeting up with Kerry - we're similar ages and found we have a lot in common," said Barnett.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's obviously a very talented and super nice guy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While Ranginui stands to win a Holden Astra and a cash prize of $50,000 on his show, Barnett is competing just for the kudos.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm really impressed that Kerry is on a reality show where there is a 'chunk of change' at stake yet he's still passing on his industry knowledge and helping others."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui was equally impressed with Barnett, describing him as a very "genuine bloke".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He is a very passionate baker and we had heaps to talk about because I qualified as a pastry chef and spent years working in hospitality while studying fashion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think we each admire the other's drive to succeed in our chosen fields."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was also the shared memories of Whanganui childhoods and the chance to share "a few war stories" about their reality TV experiences.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In episode six of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>, Ranginui once again made it safely through to the next round after creating a high-end fashion look influenced by wallpaper designs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was super stressful - we only had a budget of $150 and there was a lot of painting involved to create a high fashion look."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And Barnett passed muster in Episode four of&nbsp;<em>The Great Kiwi Bake Off</em>&nbsp;although he struggled a bit with the bread themed challenges and forgot to salt his hand-made butter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was almost 'sconeski' with my signature bake but live to fight another day."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In their day jobs, Ranginui is a pattern maker for world-renowned designer Karen Walker and Barnett is a TV producer for&nbsp;<em>Sky Sport</em>&nbsp;as well as being a dad to 2-year-old daughter Isabelle.</p>
