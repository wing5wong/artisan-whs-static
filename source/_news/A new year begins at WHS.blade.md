<p>(Photo taken at WHS Athletics Day of which the whole school was a part of, 21 February 2019)</p>
<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The morning of Monday, 28 January saw all Year 13 students, Kia Whaiora, and all staff welcome 300 Year 9 students and their whānau, new students and new staff on to Whanganui High School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to a number of retirements at the end of 2018, we warmly welcomed the following new staff members; Roz Armstrong (Teacher-in-charge of Drama); Gina Edmonds (Science teacher); Claire Libeau (Social Studies and Accounting teacher); Amanda Meade (Social Studies and English teacher); Tim Pauro (Physical Education and Te Reo Maori teacher); Time Sutherland (Digital Technologies teacher); Lisa Tahuaroa (English and Drama teacher); Terry Tubman (Guidance Counsellor); Anna van de Vyver (International teacher-aide); Leah Viles (Dance and English teacher); Minnie Young-Wilson (Social Studies and Chinese teacher).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we near the end of Week 7, students have generally completed their first learning assessment in classes and competed in swimming and athletic championships. Various outdoor education classes have also participated in tramping, camping and kayaking activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interim reports will be e-mailed to whānau on 15 March and our Student Achievement Conferences will be held on the afternoons and evenings of Wednesday, 10 April and Thursday 11April. During the week beginning 25 March our rowing squad, girls&rsquo; softball, boys&rsquo; softball, senior girls&rsquo; volleyball and senior boys&rsquo; volleyball teams will all be competing at various summer tournament week locations around the North Island.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am always available to meet with to discuss any matters relating to education and LIFE at Whanganui High School.&nbsp;</p>
