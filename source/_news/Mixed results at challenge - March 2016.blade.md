<p>WHS 1st XI Boys Cricket Team - Eric Head, with Jordan Candish, Timothy Roebuck, Quinn Mailman, Joseph Redpath, Matthew Zimmerman, and Cole Brasting. Reece Hoobin, Wiremu Hiri, Cameron MacKintosh, Kohlt Coveny, Hamish Broadhead.</p>
<p>Wanganui High School teams had a mixed bag in their interschool challenge against Wairarapa College last week at Victoria Park, although their star player was a class above in the girls first victory.</p>
<p>The Wairarapa girls team would have been confident after amassing 225/3 from their 30 overs, but WHS's New Zealand A representative Jessica Watkin proceeded to smash 167 not out to lead her team to 226/2 with five overs to spare.</p>
<p>Watkin's innings was so dominant that her team mate Mikal Terrey offered the most support by scoring 10.</p>
<p>The WHS first boys were beaten by 90 runs after an unfortunate batting collapse against spin bowling in their 40 over game.</p>
<p>WHS's bowlers made a good start, getting three wickets for just six runs, eventually bowling Wairarapa College out for 190 after a middle order recovery.</p>
<p>Timothy Roebuck (4-27), Joseph Redpath (2-39) and Quinn Mailman (2-34) were the main benefactors.</p>
<p>Opening batsmen Redpath and Cameron MacKintosh made a good start, reaching 55/0 after 13 overs, but WHS would lose all their wickets for just 45 runs more, which included Cole Brasting making 21. The home team had no answer to the leg spin of Hugo Wakeling, who would take 8-21 in a devastating 6.5 over spell.</p>
<p>The WHS boys colts team had a hard 120 run loss to Wairarapa, who amassed 176/7 from their 30 overs and then bowled the home team out for 56.</p>
<p>WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said the first XI has been lucky to have the expertise of Whanganui cricket stalwart Eric Head as their coach this season.</p>
<p>"We have put a pathway in place for our cricket players at WHS and with Eric's knowledge that he can give our players, we are hoping to develop cricket again at WHS."</p>
