<p>The people's choice winner of the Den of Dragons promotion in July last year is taking shape and set to launch at Queen's Birthday in June.</p>
<p>The event is the Youth Games is an idea pitched by Dilan Raj and Andy Lock who have been bringing the concept to life over the last six months.</p>
<p>With concerns around Y9 and Y10 students dropping out of secondary school sports, the Youth Games is designed to create a memorable participation event becoming an annual highlight for the students over their early secondary years.</p>
<p>"Keeping them involved over those two years will give them a foundation to move forward," Raj said.</p>
<p>"In addition, it's a known fact that participation in sport models social behaviour and encourages hard work, honesty, reliability, diligence and leadership."</p>
<p>There is also a bonus to Whanganui as the Youth Games aims to draw in numbers from around the North Island over four days of Queen's Birthday.</p>
<p>The economic impact will be huge and the organisers are encouraging the local community to rally behind the event.</p>
<p>Fresh off the New Zealand Masters Games, Whanganui Events Trust chief executive Kathy Cunningham has supported the Youth Games from inception and has provided advice and guidance in bringing the event to life.</p>
<p>"Two Monkeys and Steve Caudwell Whanganui Photography have provided expertise to compliment the Events Trust. The Whanganui District Council and Whanganui and Partners have provided further support to market the city and its benefits to participants and visitors.The latest partner to come on board has been Local and Loyal and they will be promoting the Youth Games through their app," Raj said.</p>
<p>Ten sporting codes have partnered the Youth Games with nine out of the 10 backed by their regional and national bodies.</p>
<p>"With interest from new codes to join the following year, the Youth Games has exciting times ahead."</p>
