**With her impish grin and upbeat personality Freyja Wrigglesworth is the perfect fit to play Buttons in Repertory Theatre's forthcoming production of _Cinders: the True Story._**

Buttons, of course, is the manservant in the home of Baron Hardup, hopelessly in love with Cinderella, and like her, very much taken for granted.

I remember Freyja playing Emmy, a child in the Helmer household in Rep's 2015 production of A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen.

"I'd only been in school plays before that, not in any plays in town. When my older brother was helping out backstage in a play here about that time the whole family became quite interested in theatre," says Freyja.

**Freyja's now a teenager, completing her second year at High School where she's been studying drama.**

"I like the way you can play different people, have different personalities and be in someone else's skin. Buttons is pretty slow, a bit of a klutz, so it's okay if I make a mistake because that's in character, isn't it?

"Buttons is often making mistakes but he does try to make Cinders laugh when he sees she's crying , peeling the onions."

Clearly, Freyja's enjoying her role in _Cinders: the True Story_. Pantos are great fun, great family entertainment so I'm sure everyone will enjoy being part of the panto audience. Do come along and join in the fun.
