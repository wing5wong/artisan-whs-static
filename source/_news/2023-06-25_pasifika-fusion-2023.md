Pasifika Fusion is a community education initiative organised by the Pasifika Pride Educators. The event is held over two days at the Regent on Broadway and this year 14 secondary schools participated in the event.  This year, the event was held on the 21st and 22nd of June. The theme was “Heroes: Past, Present and Future”.

 The categories open to the students are wearable arts, visual arts, cinematography, drama, quiz, talent, English speech, Pasifika speech, Poetry, Science, Essay, debate and cultural performances.

 This year, I had a group of 20 students, from Years 9 to 13, who had put in numerous hours after school and during the weekends in preparation for the Pasifika Fusion. Prior to the competition, we had a dress rehearsal held during the Fiafia night at school, which was attended by the whānau of the students. At the Fusion, the WHS Pasifika Group took part in the quiz, talent, speech, poetry and cultural performance categories over the two days.  The students travelled with three teachers and their tutor. 

 Vivian Tofa and Bethell Tofa took part in the Wearable Arts category where they had to design a costume using materials from their culture. This masterpiece was a representation of the past and the future made by weaving mat from laupaono leaves, It also had hand painted malu and tatau symbols and was made from linen/cotton.
