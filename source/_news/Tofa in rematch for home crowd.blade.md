<p><span>After helping Wanganui to back-to-back Meads Cup titles, former WHS student, Viki Tofa will return to the boxing ring to compete for the River City club in a fortnight.</span></p>
<p>The River City Boxing Club is promising an even bigger and better amateur fight night with the Tofa family's prodigal son on the top of the bill next month.</p>
<p>The Tofa family in Eddie and Sandra are organising the Wanganui Boxing Tournament with 20 bouts scheduled, which includes representatives coming from 17-18 different boxing clubs, from Northland through to the lower North Island.</p>
<p>Sandra Tofa said eight club members - seven guys and one girl - will be on the card.</p>
<p>"We've got them all matched at the moment, but that depends on if the other person turns up on the day."</p>
<p>Some, like Jesse and Judah Malcolm, have had previous experience, while others will be on debut.</p>
<p>The headline fight will be Viki Tofa taking on Upper Hutt's Cory Enoka, of the Bellevue Boxing Club.</p>
<p>Eddie Tofa is confident the chance to watch his son fight will be a big draw card for fans with Viki being a dual international - having fought previously for New Zealand and last year making the NZ Heartland XV for rugby.</p>
<p>The two fighters have met before, back in 2011 on a Bellevue card when Tofa was making a serious push on the national boxing scene.</p>
<p>Tofa took a 33-21 points decision after a real scrap, where the key to victory was getting under the reach of the taller Enoka and doing damage with uppercuts.</p>
<p>Six years down the track, Eddie Tofa said his son will have to "release the elbows" and get to work if he also wanted to win the rematch.</p>
<p>"[Enoka]'s a big six foot something fella, he's a big boy."</p>
<p>The event follows on from the success of the club's first tournament at their new gym at the Kaierau Rugby Club back in October, with 13 North Island clubs sending representatives.</p>
<p>This tournament will be on March 4, with doors opening at 3.30pm ahead of the first bout at 4pm.</p>
<p>Door sales will be $15 for adults and $10 for under 15's, with food and non-alcohol drink available on site.</p>
