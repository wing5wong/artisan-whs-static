<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's musical youth demonstrated their remarkable talent at both Rockquest and NZ Community Trust Chamber Music Contest last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now there will be another chance to see some of them perform again this Saturday as they make guest appearances with the Lyric Singers at their Homeward Bound concert.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Choir director and music teacher Joanna Love said it is a pleasure to include performances by The Millennium Trio, Two Crotchets &amp; A Quaver and The Buzz Rolls - all prize and place winners in the chamber music contest in the programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Buzz Rolls are a Year 10 Whanganui High School percussion group and they will play&nbsp;<em>A Day at the Races</em>&nbsp;composed by their teacher Michael Franklin-Browne," says Love.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Two Crotchets &amp; A Quaver will perform two songs by Anthony Ritchie and The Millennium Trio will play music by David Hamilton."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Lyric Singers will perform four brackets of songs including folk songs and show tunes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Wild Mountain Thyme</em>&nbsp;will feature the choir's accompanist Lisa Boessenkool playing flute with Marie Brooks on piano.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Lyric Singers and guests will perform at Trinity Methodist Church in Wicksteed St at 2pm this Saturday. Admission is $15 for adults and free for children.</strong></p>
