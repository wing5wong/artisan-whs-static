<p class="element element-paragraph">As stoked as Eva Harkness (<span>former WHS student)&nbsp;</span>was to win Ucol Whanganui's "hand on car" competition, she was also upset for her nearest rival.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Seventeen Ucol students began the competition at 7pm on Friday, with contestants placing a hand on a car outside the Whanganui campus with the last to take their hand away winning the car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Harkness won the competition early on Sunday morning after two sleepless nights when she was the only one standing after 38 and a half hours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her prize was a 2005 Ford Fiesta from Wanganui Motors which she was presented with on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In an act of kindness Harkness has decided to donate her old Toyota Corolla to runner-up Heather Leeves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Harkness said after the event that she developed an affinity with the last one standing because, "You go through the same thing together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both women were emotional after the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think it's an awesome gesture, I really do," Leeves said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the pair have caught up on some sleep since finishing on Sunday.</p>
<p><span><span>"I went and had a spa, my friend brought her kids around and we played in the spa for a while and ordered Hell's Pizza... I think I got to sleep about 9.30pm," Harkness said.</span></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just didn't want to sleep all day, because you don't catch up on sleep eh? You don't sleep for 24 hours, you just have one good sleep."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leeves said: "I feel pretty good, I don't have sore muscles or anything. I took a couple of hours."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The competition was part of the 10-year celebrations for the Whanganui Ucol campus.</p>
