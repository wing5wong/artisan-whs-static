<p class="element element-paragraph">A ceremony was held to acknowledge tertiary students who have successfully completed programmes of study with Whanganui training provider Training For You.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Students, their families and supporters gathered alongside tutors and other staff for an evening of celebration.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ceremony, at Heritage House, highlighted the achievements of students graduating from the Semester One 2017 programmes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Forty-nine students were presented with certificates of completion, across five areas of study; business administration &amp; computing, health &amp; education, healthcare, literacy and numeracy, and early childhood. Several special awards were presented to students that showed outstanding attributes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Among the students were mother-and-daughter duo Donna Jones and Shavaughn Jones-Dennan (former WHS student) who completed the business administration and early childhood education programmes respectively.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sisters Holly and Hannah Evans (both former WHS students) completed the healthcare programme together, and Cyndy Puapii completed the early childhood programme alongside her daughter Tara.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Early childhood tutor Amy Fitzgerald sees the benefits of knowledge sharing amongst the different generations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They can encourage each other both on campus and at home with their learning," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They can then support each other into their next career path, contributing to the household and empowering the whole family."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Of the 14 students that graduated from the healthcare programme, eight have already secured employment within the sector. Another is employed elsewhere, and one student is about to take her study a step further, having secured a place on the UCOL three-year nursing degree programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">General manager Campbell Means commended the students on their achievements and encouraged them to build on the momentum of their current success.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's important for graduating students to build upon their self-belief, reinforce the changes they are making in their lives, and give themselves as many opportunities to be successful as they can."</p>
