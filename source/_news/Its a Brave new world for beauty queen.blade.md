<p class="element element-paragraph">Jessica Tyson may seem to have it all - beauty, intelligence, a successful TV journalism career and the Miss World New Zealand title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But the stunning 25-year-old from Whanganui has a painful story which she shared on MƒÅori Television's&nbsp;<em>Native Affairs</em>&nbsp;programme on Monday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyson spoke of the sexual abuse she first suffered at the hands of a family friend as a 7-year-old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I knew it was wrong but I didn't know why," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I pretended I was asleep because I didn't want to confront the situation."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Unlike many children abused by adults, Tyson was able to tell her mother about the man's behaviour and testified against him in the Whanganui District Court as a 9-year-old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was hard because I couldn't name the parts of my anatomy I was asked about."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The words she needed were not in her vocabulary, she told the interviewer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her abuser was not convicted due to lack of evidence but Tyson said the support of her "loving whanau" got her through the experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyson also made a public disclosure during the Miss World New Zealand competition in April this year and says she was inspired by a fellow contestant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She bravely talked about her childhood sexual abuse and I was after her so I shared my story too."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The experience inspired her to found the Brave charity this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brave works to raise awareness about sexual violence affecting young people and provides tools to help those affected through community projects.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sexual violence affects a lot of young people and they need to know they can speak out."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyson told Native Affairs that being Miss World New Zealand may seem "easy and pretty" but said the role is "really, really challenging".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The title, she said, has given her a wonderful platform to speak from and as well as launching Brave she has fundraised for Annie's Lifeline - an organisation that gives scholarships to youth who are suicide survivors or have gone through mental health problems.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The charity was started by 2017 Miss World New Zealand Annie Evans.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyson recently held Brave workshops at Whanganui Girls College and Nga Tawa School in Marton and she plans to visit other schools in the region soon.</p>
