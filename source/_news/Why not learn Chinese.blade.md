<p>Why not learn Chinese? NZ Chinese Language Week<br />Stall in Trafalgar Square on Sunday</p>
<p>The New Zealand Chinese Language week, now in its third year, aims to raise awareness of the need for greater understanding of culture and language between New Zealand and China &ndash; our largest trading partner.</p>
<p>While 84 per cent of Kiwis in an Asia New Zealand Foundation Survey thought it important for New Zealand to develop cultural and economic ties with Asia, only 35 per cent said they knew&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">&lsquo;a fair amount&rsquo; or &lsquo;a lot&rsquo; about Asia, a number that has barely increased since the survey began in 2013.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">A similar number &ndash; eight in ten &ndash; thought school children should learn another language, and 53 per cent of those thought it should be Chinese. This contrasts starkly with the number of Year 12 and 13 students actually learning Chinese &ndash; which stood at 13 per cent in 2016.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The NZCLW Trust encourages all kiwis to give Chinese a go and learn at least five simple phrases.

<p><span class="text_exposed_show">In Whanganui an introduction to Chinese language and culture is available at a number of primary schools thanks to the Confucius Institute which sponsors two Mandarin Language Assistants at Whanganui High School. There has also been a MLA based at Collegiate although they do not offer language teaching. The only secondary school in Whanganui that does is High School.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">High School acts like a hub to promote the language and culture in Whanganui. Beck Ding is the teacher and he has students from year nine through to NCEA level 3. At the junior level it is more &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and gets serious at level 1. The MLAs assist his senior students with conversations and one on one speaking.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Chinese language classes have been available through Community Education, depending on numbers. Beck says he assists with promotion and resources. He is also the representative of teachers of Chinese for the lower North Island and attends meetings of the Chinese Teachers Association, normally in Auckland.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Students of the language say it opens up a whole new perspective and a way of looking at the world, plus opportunities to go overseas and experience another lifestyle. It also leads to an increasing number of jobs.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">On this Sunday, members of the local NZ Chinese Association will have a stall at Trafalgar Square from 11.30 to 4pm. They will provide information about the language and aspects of Chinese culture.</span></p>
