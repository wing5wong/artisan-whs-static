Our Director of International Students, Natasha McKee, is part of the Whanganui delegation to Asia, rebuilding valuable relationships with Whanganui High School's partner agents and schools, in this post-covid era.

Our delegation to Asia has made great progress in its first two days, meeting agents and schools in Tokyo. On Monday, the delegation participated in an [](<>)Education New Zealand seminar.

The collaboration and regional representation between these schools were invaluable as they worked together to facilitate the needs of Japanese schools, especially in order to meet larger group visits.

Along with our schools' excellent facilities and reputations, Whanganui's UNESCO City of Design designation played an important role in these interactions, highlighting our unique character and point of difference. On Tuesday, the delegation had a day full of appointments with local schools and agents. Touring Japanese school facilities and meeting kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) enabled the delegation to reach a good understanding of the Japanese students' and educators' needs.

The delegation will meet with more schools today. On Thursday morning the group will visit Tokyo Board of Education before continuing on to Osaka.
