<p><span>CAST: The very talented on-stage component of Red Riding Hood. <br />PICTURE: Lizz Hudson</span></p>
<p><em>Red Riding Hood</em><br />A Pantomime By Roger Hall<br />Lyrics by Paul Jenden, music by Michael Nicholas Williams<br />Directed by Colin Hedivan<br />Presented by Wanganui Repertory Theatre<br />Opening Night, Friday, December 9.<br /><strong>Reviewed by Paul Brooks</strong></p>
<p>A great script, a seasoned cast, an inspired director, a talented orchestra (of three), a hard working production team, a quick-witted crew, a creative wardrobe department and an appreciative audience were the ingredients of a successful and impressive opening night when Red Riding Hood took to the stage at Repertory on Friday.</p>
<p>In the spirit of panto there was a basic premise, the fairytale of Little Red Riding Hood. Roger Hall has stripped it back to its bawdy roots while keeping a thin veneer of a children's story.</p>
<p>The audience always plays an integral part in such a production, so this required the complete removal of the fourth wall.</p>
<p>The characters are Grandmother Hood (Chris McKenzie), her daughter Mother Hood (Bridget Hurley) and her daughter Red Riding Hood (Millie Manning), a man-starved family eager to accept the advances of ... pretty much anyone.</p>
<p>There is a wolf, played with canine diligence by Lauren Karl; Lance, the man from DoC (Benjamin Clow); a couple of "blokes", Morris and Boris (Brylee Noble and Konrad Shaw) and ... drumroll ... the villain.</p>
<p>The villain is worthy of special mention. Without him there is no pantomime. He is Sir Roger Bounder, property developer and cad, played with panache by Paul Collins. He was suave, persuasive, arrogant, confident and rotten to the core. He played the audience beautifully, getting all the boos in the right places, and ad-libbing for all he was worth.</p>
<p>Sir Roger - one wonders how he earned the knighthood - while indispensable, could not have been the villain he was without a superb cast providing the storyline, conflict and loads of gags.</p>
<p>Every single cast member earned our respect and praise, presenting their characters completely OTT for our inspection and approval.</p>
<p>They excelled.</p>
<p>Grandmother Hood was written for Chris McKenzie. In a costume designed for laughs, he owned the stage. Superb comic timing and facial expressions that never failed to amuse helped him win the audience immediately.</p>
<p>Bridget Hurley fitted easily into the part of Mother Hood, competing with Grandmother for the villain's dubious favours.</p>
<p>Millie Manning is proving to be quite a talent, on and off the gymnastics mat. Her Red Riding Hood has set a new standard.</p>
<p>Morris and Boris were fun, pure and simple. They addressed the audience like old friends and Brylee and Konrad slipped effortlessly into the roles demanded of them.</p>
<p>Ben Clow was wasted when he played the wheelchair-bound part of President Franklin D Roosevelt in Whanganui High School's production of Annie. He moves too well to be so inhibited. His Lance, the man from DoC, was sheer delight and well played.</p>
<p>Hats off to the wolf. Lauren prowled that stage fluidly, breaking into unexpected moments of comedy and pathos, taking the audience with her.</p>
<p>The cast also sang and performed a few dance moves - courtesy of choreographer Bridget Rison - with strong musical backing from James Lee (drums), Ted Charlton (Musical Director and keyboard) and Ben Power (piano).</p>
<p>Above all it was funny. We laughed a lot and had a good time doing what an audience does in panto. We cheered, we booed, we yelled at the cast and we appreciated every rehearsal they put in to make it a fine, funny show.</p>
<p>At intermission the theatre provides a cuppa or a cold drink and biscuits, and, for good measure, a coffee cart parks outside and does good business.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;- get your tickets and have a good time.</p>
