**Congratulations to our WHS Kowhai Debating Team who won their debate against Freyberg High School this week.**

<p>The moot was that this house supports increased government surveillance.</p>
<p>Our team was the affirming side and the adjudicators found that their arguments were more persuasive in proving that greater surveillance will lead to greater safety for New Zealanders.</p>
<p>Good work, team and good team work!</p>
