Over the past two days a group of Year 10 students have participated in the BP Business Challenge. Students were put into groups and had to come up with a business idea which solved a problem, and then pitch their idea to judges. Congratulations to our winning team whose product was a Consumer Spoon. Zac Boulton was the winner of the Hero Award. 

Thank you to Paul, Lambrini and Liz from the Young Enterprise Trust for facilitating the
challenge. 

A massive thank you to Lana Brown, Brayden Coley, Peter Redpath and Niki Vernon for being our
guest judges.
