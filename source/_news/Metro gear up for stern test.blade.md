<p><span>Metro's Brayden Maua (former WHS student last year) in action earlier this year. The Whanganui side face their biggest match of the season when they come up against Massey White.</span></p>
<p>ST JOHNS Whanganui Metro Colts will head into their biggest match of the season on the back of another week off due to opposition default.</p>
<p>Metro played no game on Saturday because Te Kawau were unable to field a team.</p>
<p>It was the second time in six weeks Metro's opposition had failed to front.</p>
<p>It means Metro remain unbeaten at the top of the McDonalds Manawatu Colts competition, two points ahead of this weekend's opponents and perennial champions Massey White, and five ahead of contender Feilding.</p>
<p>But co-coach Carl Gibson wasn't too concerned about lack of game time ahead of such an important match.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a shame," he said.</p>
<p>"I think duck shooting probably had an effect. But I think they'll be all right.</p>
<p>"We'll have a pretty intense training to make up for that game stuff."</p>
<p>This Saturday's game, to be held at <strong>Whanganui High School</strong>, shapes as an intriguing contest.</p>
<p>In their inaugural season, Metro failed to beat Massey White, however the Wanganui side look to be in with the better chance this time around.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Metro beat Feilding 24-10, just a week after Massey went down to the third-placed Feilding side.</p>
<p>"They're definitely beatable. We need to just keep doing what we're doing, basically, but just do it well," Gibson said.</p>
<p>"Everyone's been training well and they know how important this game is."</p>
<p>It was important to get on top of the table early on in the first round to be in prime position to host home finals, he said.</p>
<p>A Metro loss to Massey White would see the two sides switch places at the top of the ladder.</p>
<p>"It's not do-or-die but it's really important to come out on top of the group," he said.</p>
<p>Gibson said Metro will take a settled squad into the game.</p>
<p><strong><em>St Johns Whanganui Metro Colts vs Massey White kicks off at 1pm at Whanganui High School.</em></strong></p>
