Students and guest artists with the Whanganui Ballet & Dance Academy will present Fairie Ball this weekend at the Prince Edward Auditorium at Whanganui Collegiate School.

The first half of the 90 minute programme will be a variety performance of classical ballet and modern and contemporary dance supported by local Whanganui Musicians, Shontae and Caleb Arthur, on the piano and violin.

Ballet teacher and director, Anna Chandulal, says these “mature, adult style dances will have wide appeal. It is an exciting, innovative mix with unusual choreography.” **Amelia Chandulal McKay**, who has returned from dancing in the USA to be the competition coach for the Whanganui Ballet and Dance while doing university studies on line, will be performing two pieces as a guest dancer.

The second half has elements of favourite musicals, movies and shows with characters such as Malevolence, the Grinch, Belle and the Beast, the White Cat and Puss in Boots, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf. 

Josh Chandulal McKay, ‘famous in Whanganui’ as a district councillor, will be expressing another side of his character by performing as the Cat in the Hat as a guest artist.

There will be about 80 dancers aged from 5 to seniors aged 18 to 20. They will be wearing costumes designed and made by Alice Patton who was a designer with the Royal NZ Ballet. Students/parents pay a small fee of $40 taking away the hassle of getting their own costume made themselves. The costumes are then kept for future shows.

Anna set up the Whanganui Ballet & Dance Academy in 2008 producing a show each year, apart from in 2020. 

Tickets are available from the Wanganui Opera House. Prices are: adults $20, children under 13  $15, and senior citizens $15. A family ticket for two adults and two children is $65.
