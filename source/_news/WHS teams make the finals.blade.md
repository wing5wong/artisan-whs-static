<p>The WHS girls team continued their strong run of form against Horowhenua in Palmerston North, picking up a comfortable 4-1 victory.</p>
<p>Goal scorers where Meghan Price, Emma Rainey, Rebecca Baker, and Kate Belsham.</p>
<p>However, the boys home derby at the Collegiate hockey turf was a real thriller, WHS getting home 3-2 after the second stage of extra time.</p>
<p>After the scorelines were deadlocked 2-2 at the end of regulation, the match went to golden goal with the teams each dropping off one player periodically.</p>
<p>"We dropped the goalie, then dropped to seven and got the goal in," said WHS spokesperson Natalie Campbell.</p>
<p>Patrick Madder, Travis Bayler and Jake Hooper got the goals for the winners.</p>
<p>Both WHS teams will now go through to the finals in Palmerston North next week, each facing the Waiapehu College teams in their respective grades.</p>
<p>The games start at 6.45pm.</p>
