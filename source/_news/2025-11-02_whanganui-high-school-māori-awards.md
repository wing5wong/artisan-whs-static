Te Tari Māori proudly hosted our annual WHS Māori Awards evening on Tuesday here in our school hall — a powerful celebration honouring the achievements, leadership and cultural contributions of our senior Māori students. 

The evening was hosted by our Heads of Māori, Ali Whanarere and Jipsy Manuel-Joseph, whose natural mana, humour and confidence set the tone from the outset. Their delivery and effortless connection with the audience created a truly warm atmosphere.

A major highlight is the presentation of highest academic award, the Māori Dux. This prestigious award was jointly presented to Sam Buchanan and Haley Kinley, both acknowledged for their outstanding academic excellence and unwavering commitment to their respective subjects.

Throughout the night, tauira were acknowledged for excellence in academics, leadership, te reo Māori, kapa haka, service and cultural commitment. Moving performance by Kia Whaiora and heartfelt kōrero reflected the strength of Māori identity within our kura, highlighting the importance of tikanga and whānau support in every success story.
