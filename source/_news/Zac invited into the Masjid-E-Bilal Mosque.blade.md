<p>"It shocks me, and it shocks all of us gathered here on this day, that anybody could blame the worst aspects of human behaviour on an entire group of people, while excluding the standards of human decency they apply to others from themselves. The attacks on the mosques in Christchurch are ones fuelled by hatred and misunderstanding, that need to be condemned. Hatred and stereotyping are issues that we must all do our best to eliminate, and we can only do this through cooperation and tolerance. We must understand each other, we must recognise our shared humanity; our shared mistakes, our shared triumphs, our shared struggles, our shared flaws, our shared strengths, and now, our shared grief, if we want to stop attacks like what was seen last Friday in Christchurch from happening again. And I want you all to take comfort in knowing that this is exactly what we came here to do."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
