It will be an afternoon of dance, singing and music as Shirley McDouall School of Dance showcases its annual production.

More than 100 dance students will perform Thumbelina and A Showcase of Dance at the Royal Wanganui Opera House today and tomorrow.

In the first part of the production students will perform the tale of Thumbelina, with **Amy Bennett as Thumbelina** in today's performance and Makenzie Tate in the lead role tomorrow.

"We're telling the tale through dance, we've also added an element of singing," ballet teacher Melissa Tate said.

**Eva Parker-Groves will dance and sing a solo as well as singing a duet with Nat Kirk.**

Students will be dressed as characters from the story, such as fairies, lizards, turtles and toads.

Although the two-part production will focus on the dance style of ballet, the second half explores many styles including contemporary, modern, tap, a hornpipe and a ballroom scene.

Tate said the ballroom scene will be "quite extravagant".

**Whanganui High School band Eugene Fink and the Interceptors will also feature in the performances.**


The show begins at 3pm and finishes about 5pm both days.
