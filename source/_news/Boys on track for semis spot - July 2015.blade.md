<p>ON THE RISE: &nbsp;The WHS 1st XI Boys' Hockey team is heading for the division one secondary school semifinal. &nbsp;The team is (back,left) Sam Pilet, Ben Luff-Scott, Ben Pilet, Joseph Redpath, Tom Adkins, Jack Pilet, Reuben Gedye, Bryn Lewis Jones; (front,left) Ronan Spence, Jimi Blinkhorne, Jordan Cohen, Ethan Cohen, Ryan Gray, Lochlan James, Travis Bayler.</p>
<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XI hockey boys are competing well in the 1st Division Secondary School Competition in Palmerston North on Thursdays.</p>
<p>They travel each week to Palmerston North and, with two weeks until semi-finals, are equal first with Waiopehu College.</p>
<p>They played Freyberg last week and won 9-0. &nbsp;The boys are on track to secure a place in the semifinals on August 13.</p>
<p>They are also working towards winter tournament week in Hamilton at the end of August. &nbsp;Last year they were fifth and this year they are aiming for a top two finish and to be promoted to the top grade of the competition for next year.</p>
<p>Only three of the players are Year 13 students, who will finish school at the end of this year, so the team has plenty of depth and has also got young up-and-coming Year 8 and Year 9 players, who take part in senior training sessions to develop for the coming season and beyond.</p>

<p>All games were great spectacles with Wanganui High School winning the senior A1 netball 37-30 and junior A1 netball 29-24. &nbsp;The WHS senior A2 netball team had a close finish going down to NPGHS 22-21.</p>
