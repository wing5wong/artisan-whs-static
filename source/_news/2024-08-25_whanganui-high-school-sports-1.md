Congratulations to our 1st XV Girls Rugby Team winning the Whanganui Girls rugby competition today against Cullinane. 

Game was 26-26 at full time. 

In the girls rules no extra time is played, so winner is worked on who scored the first try of the game. 

And that was US!!!    Woohoo WHS 

Well done girls ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
