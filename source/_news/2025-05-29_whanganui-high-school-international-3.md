🌏 Connections Across Oceans 🌿

While on the current Hokkaido Exchange, our Director of International Students, Natasha McKee, had the privilege of visiting Hokusei Gakuen Girls' Junior and Senior High School in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. We're excited to welcome three students from Hokusei Gakuin in Term 3, including Koto Abe, pictured below, along with the principal of Hokusei Gakuin, Karen Bessin. 

Koto has a deep interest in indigenous cultures — she has volunteered as an English-speaking guide at the Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park in Hokkaido and is now looking forward to learning more about te reo Māori and Māori culture during her time in Whanganui.

We’re thrilled to be building connections between Ainu and Māori culture through this international exchange and can’t wait to welcome Koto and her classmates to our school next term! 🌿🤝
