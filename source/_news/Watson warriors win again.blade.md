<p><strong>Kasey Watson, Callaghan Watson and Keightley Watson with their Sydney medals.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Watson family has continued their success at international judo tournaments with a trio of medals at the recent Sydney Open at Olympic Park.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Callaghan Watson won the Junior Boys over 50kg gold medal, while older brother Keightley Watson (WHS student) received silver in the Cadets over 90kg division.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Their cousin Kasey Watson&nbsp;(WHS student)&nbsp;claimed silver in the Cadets under 73kg grade.</strong></p>
<p>The Wanganui Judo Club family members continued their run of winning medals across the Tasman, having had success in Queensland and Canberra.</p>
<p>"Given the quality of fighters there, which included the typically strong New Caledonian team, all three fighters fought well throughout with good results," said Ross Watson, father of Callaghan and Keightley.</p>
<p>They were backing up from the previous weekend's North Island championships in Wellington, where Keightley did the double with gold in the Cadets over 90kg division and then winning the Cadets open weight.</p>
<p>Kasey Watson won another silver in his grade.</p>
<p>"Then only having a short turn around and the travel involved they did well," said Ross Watson.</p>
<p>There is one 2016 tournament left for the Watson's - the upcoming New Zealand championships in Auckland this October.</p>
