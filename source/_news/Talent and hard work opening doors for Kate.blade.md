<p><span>A SONGWRITER'S VISION: The winner of last month's Musicians' Club songwriting competition, former WHS student Kate Van Elswijk, overcame a vision impairment to compete on <em>The Voice Australia</em>. <br />PHOTO: Stuart Munro</span></p>
<p>A blind Whanganui musician has revealed how she overcame her impairment to compete in the hugely popular TV show&nbsp;<em>The Voice Australia</em>.</p>
<p>Kate Van Elswijk, who last month won the Whanganui Musicians' Club songwriting competition, was initially unsure about entering the Aussie singing competition.</p>
<p>She is legally blind, with a condition called achromatopica. It means she has around 10 per cent vision and can only see three metres ahead in black and white with minimal peripheral vision.</p>
<p>"I auditioned at the last minute - I was really indecisive whether I should or not because TV is a big deal. You are putting yourself out there ... and there are some people who are going to judge you."</p>
<p>Growing up in Whanganui, 20-year-old Ms Van Elswijk had dreams of being a dancer and graduated from the Sharon Underwood School of Dance in 2013, going on to enrol in the Ettingshausens Performing Arts Institute in Sydney.</p>
<p>Despite her hesitation, she sent in an audition video for the&nbsp;<em>The Voice Australia</em>&nbsp;in December 2015, and made it past the audition rounds to the show's live televised section.</p>
<p>That's when she had to sing for the judges and hope that one of them would choose her to join their team.</p>
<p>"When I sang, Ronan Keating turned around at the last minute of my song and I, being visually impaired, couldn't tell that it was him.</p>
<p>"I knew somebody had turned around - I could see the lights flashing - but I didn't know who it was until they started talking. I found out it was Ronan, which was super exciting."<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>She believes his style of music matches hers and, with him as a her coach, she made it through to the 12th episode before being eliminated in a duet battle.</p>
<p>"It was an awesome experience and I got meet some amazing people, artists and singers - and I learned a lot about myself."</p>
<p>Though she enjoyed her time on the show, it wasn't without its challenges.</p>
<p>"It was hard at times - everyone has their opinion about you and you have to ignore everything on social media.</p>
<p>"Some of it was positive, though - I had people message me with the same eye condition as me who were inspired, and it gave them hope.</p>
<p>"But then there was the bad side of social media where people rubbish you without knowing the full story of your life. You can't let it get to you.</p>
<p>"It also showed me that you have to work very hard for what you love - you&nbsp;<br />can't ride on talent alone."</p>
<p>After she finished, she was keen to push her career in the music industry, but suffered a serious setback.</p>
<p>"I was in a hip-hop class two weeks after The Voice and I felt this snap in my knee."</p>
<p>She had been experiencing growing pain in her legs and they had reached the point where she could hardly dance.</p>
<p>"Going for a 20-minute walk was like the most painful thing ever. It was agony and I was on far too many painkillers."</p>
<p>An X-ray revealed she had been developing stress fractures along the front of her knees for more than three years.</p>
<p>She came back to New Zealand to get surgery for the injury but was put on a lengthy waiting list.</p>
<p>"Waiting ... that was the hardest thing. I was told if I danced with my knees the way they are I could snap my tibia bone all the way through, and that would have meant bone grafts, rods ... nasty stuff."</p>
<p>After the surgery she decided to come back to Whanganui to heal and now teaches at the Sharyn Underwood School Of Dance.</p>
<p>She heard about the Musicians' Club song competition and decided to have a go.</p>
<p>"When I got there I practised for about an hour. I hadn't decided which of my songs to play until I got on stage and got the vibe.</p>
<p>"Someone had played a really fast song so I thought, 'OK, why don't I slow this down for a bit, it's the last song of the night'.</p>
<p>"So I played a piece called&nbsp;<em>Close Your Eyes.</em>"</p>
<p>The song is about her boyfriend's mother who died a few months ago.</p>
<p>"It's a really pretty piece ... it made a few of my friends cry."</p>
<p>The song won over the judges and Ms Van Elswijk won first place out of 16 contestants.</p>
<p>While it can take months to write a song, if she feels a connection with the subject inspiration comes quickly.</p>
<p>"For me, it needs to be personal - I've written songs for other people and I find it a lot harder to write for someone else than to write for myself.</p>
<p>"You always take from your experiences, your emotions and stuff you've been through in life and you write it down like you're writing a story."</p>
<p>It has been five months since her surgery and, if all goes well, in four months her legs will mend and she will be back to pursuing her dream.</p>
<p>"Being visually impaired or having some sort of impairment doesn't have to hinder your dreams and your career options," she said.</p>
<p>"You just have to find ways around it and do what makes you happy."</p>
