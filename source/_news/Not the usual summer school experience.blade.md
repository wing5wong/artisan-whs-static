<p>HOME VISIT: &nbsp;Whanganui student (and former WHS student) Scott Flutey back from Rwanda and the Commonwealth Summer School.</p>
<p>Student Scott&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;came home to Whanganui for the weekend.</p>
<p>It was his first visit back since he had been at the Commonwealth Summer School in Rwanda in August.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old, who has a Bachelor of Honours in history and international relations, was the first New Zealand student to have been selected for the summer school which has been running for six years.</p>
<p>The summer school was instigated in 2011 to provide a forum for high-quality students from every corner of the Commonwealth to discuss issues of global importance. It is hosted in a different country each year.</p>
<p>Mr&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;was granted a bursary to attend the school and said although he was slightly fearful heading off to Africa alone, his time there was wonderful and steeped in culture."</p>
<p>The 40 selected students were mostly South African and African, he said.</p>
<p>The school in the capital of Kigli was at the University of Rwanda which is still quite new and modern, Mr&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>Things have dramatically changed in Rwanda since 1994 and the genocide, known officially as the genocide against the Tutsi people.</p>
<p>It had been mass slaughter of about 800,000 Tutsi in Rwanda by members of the Hutu majority government.</p>
<p>Because so many men died during the genocide huge numbers of women were left without partners, which has meant now there is a portfolio in Government for a Minster of Gender and Family Promotion.</p>
<p>Thousands of women in Rwanda lost their men and were left in charge of most of the children, Mr&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>"The ministry help these women with their growing sons and strengthening family unity. I was amazed to know there are now 64 women in the Rwanda Parliament," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Flutey's honours thesis about the many patriotic women's groups in New Zealand during the Boer War, has sparked the interest of a publisher in South Africa.</p>
<p>"It is finished but I still need to check it and read again before it goes to my supervisor, then off to the publisher."</p>
<p>When he comes home to Whanganui during the lengthy summer break Mr&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;works for the Whanganui District Council and is doing an internship at the Alexander Library.</p>
<p>"I'm very fortunate. It is the perfect job," he said.</p>
<p>As a small boy Mr&nbsp;Flutey&nbsp;went to Carlton School then on to Whanganui High School.</p>
<p>"I love being in Wellington but I try to come home as much as possible, too."</p>
<p>His time in Rwanda was spectacular, he said.</p>
<p>"I am still so thrilled I was given the chance".</p>
