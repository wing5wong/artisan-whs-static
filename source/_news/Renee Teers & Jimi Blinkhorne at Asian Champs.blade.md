<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hot" and "good" were two Whanganui teenagers impression of the South Korea city of Namwon after they spent nine days in competition at the 2018 Asian Roller Games earlier this month.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Speedskater Renee Teers was part of the four-person New Zealand skate team which entered the Junior Women's Grade (Under 19)</strong>, with her team mates all from Timaru's South Canterbury club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Meanwhile, roller hockey exponent Jimi Blinkhorne was joined by veteran Dean Fitness as part of the New Zealand Roller Hockey team entering the Asia-Oceania Championship.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Kiwis all had the goal to qualifying in their sports for the 2019 World Roller Games in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Back at Whanganui High School this week, Teers and Blinkhorne both said the same thing &ndash; competing on the international level is way faster.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Teers would compete in sprint events in the morning at Namwon, then enter the endurance races in the evening.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's more controlled about it, they know what they are doing," she said about the skill level of the field compared to national events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The sprints were a lot faster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I fell in the 15km elimination [race] on track, so it was painful."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although not reaching the podium at her first overseas event, being one of the younger competitors at age 16, <strong>Teers made the final of the 1000m and finished in the Top 10 of the 20km elimination race on the road, and the 1km race on track.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Qualified for Barcelona, her focus now is on harder training and improving her technique, since she has seen the standard required.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Trying to make everything go better....and try not to fall over."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Given Blinkhorne and his team mate's previous international experience was restricted to Trans-Tasman clashes, the team had set themselves the goal of winning one of their six games in Namwon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>They accomplished that in the 10-1 win over China, with Blinkhorne scoring a hat trick of goals.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were a young team," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's way different to just playing Aussie. A lot faster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Aussie only beat us 5-1, compared to the Trans-Tasman which was 17-2.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Fitness is key."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Australians went on to win the tournament, but <strong>New Zealand have also qualified for the Barcelona, with Blinkhorne and Teers now focused on preparations so they can be there when the New Zealand flag is carried in for the opening ceremony.<br /></strong><a href="http://www.wrg2019.com/en/principal">World Roller Games 2019</a></p>
