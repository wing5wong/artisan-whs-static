<p><strong>In the Youth Ministocks WHS student Kaelin Mooney (26V) took the second race by a mere 0.02 seconds at the Oceanview Speedway on the weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All the elements were there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The pits were full to overflowing two hours before the start of the meeting, the weather was fantastic, and a good crowd was on hand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And the action at Supercheap Auto Oceanview Family Speedway lived up to the expectations, despite the two feature events being dominated by two drivers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">1NZ's Christian Hermansen proved his second New Zealand Minisprint title was no fluke.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Hermanator" was in outstanding form, winning a third consecutive New Zealand Minisprint Grand Prix.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A win and a second place in his heats put Hermansen on pole position for the 20-lap final.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alongside him was the impressive Lydia Dickinson (75S).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Karl McGill (93P) lowered his own lap record to 13.78s, enroute to the second row of the grid, which he shared with Glen McCutcheon (44P).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hermansen blasted away from the start, and was quickly up to pace.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His third and fourth laps both shattered the lap record &ndash; now 13.66 seconds &ndash; as he showed blistering speed while the track held some moisture.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As the laps counted down there was a series of incidents, as McGill got caught up trying to lap Cameron Hurley (82V) and almost rolled. His race was over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McCutcheon then fell by the wayside, and Ben Vaughn (57H) had to go to the back of the field while challenging for a podium position.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After several restarts, Hermansen took the win from Dickinson, with Nathan Jeffries (8P) in third place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hermansen had a number of issues with his new car early in the season, but has put those behind them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At prizegiving, he paid tribute to his crew chief father Mike Hermansen, engines builders Bryan and Nelson Hartley, and Mike Robins from Terminator Race Cars.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A massive field of 29 Stockcars started the first heat of the Charlie Berntsen Trophy and predictably, it didn't take long for carnage to break out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Trazarn Ryland-Annabell (33V)</strong> fired Dion Black (61V) into the wall on the back straight rolling Black's car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Defending trophy holder Francis Potaka was an early casualty, along with other good prospects including Callum Sturzaker (15V), Chet Swan (9V) and Brandon Jurgeleit (882P).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Less than half the field finished the first heat which was won by Dion Mooney (6V) from <strong>Mark Johnston (78V) and Scooter McIntosh (22V).</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The second heat was a more orderly affair with Darryl Taylor taking the win in Trevor Greig's 81V car from <strong>Mason James (53V)</strong> and the ever-present Mooney.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After two heats, Mooney had a one point lead over Taylor.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>McIntosh</strong> was another two points further back, closely followed by <strong>James and Johnston</strong>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The third heat was another torrid affair.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Aidan Pond (19P) was left stranded against the wall at the southern end on the first lap and as the leaders came round again, Kyle Lampp (772P) ran wide and slammed into Pond's car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That set off a chain reaction which caught out Johnston.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Clipping a car as he tried to avoid the mayhem, Johnston finished on his side, and out of the running.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the second time in two meetings that he had been rolled at that spot. In the meantime, Mooney drove a stealth mission to reach the front.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lampp killed James's chances by blocking him for a lap and a half, and as the laps counted down Jurgeleit put in a massive hit on Taylor, slowing the 81V car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mooney took the race win, from McIntosh in second place and Damon Baxter (7V) in third. Taylor limped home in fifth place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When the points were tallied Mooney had won 'The Charlie' with 85 points.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McIntosh finished second on 81 points and Taylor had done enough to finish third, a point further back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Receiving the trophy from Berntsen's widow Ann, Mooney told the crowd in the clubrooms it was his second time winning the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He regards this one as more special however, given that Big Bad Charlie is no longer around.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Superstocks, Clint Hill (29V), Chad Ace (4V) and Daniel Hole (471P) shared the victories.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bradley Korff (86S) was dominant in the Adult Ministocks, with three wins from three.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">North Island Champion Grant Loveridge (7V) won the opening Production Saloon race, but had to bow to Jason Pointon (71V) in the next two races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And in the Youth Ministocks, another Mooney starred.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After coming a close second to Louis Redshaw (7P) in the opening race, <strong>Kaelin Mooney (26V) took the second race</strong> by a mere 0.02 seconds from Cody Hodge (21P), and added the feature race as well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Given the hot weather conditions, the track was in superb condition, a credit to the track crew led by Mike Annabell.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That allowed some fantastic racing in all classes, with the crowd going home happy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Racing at Oceanview Family Speedway resumes on Sunday, March 11, at 3pm with the running of the West Coast Sidecars, and the Heiby Memorial Youth Ministocks.</p>
