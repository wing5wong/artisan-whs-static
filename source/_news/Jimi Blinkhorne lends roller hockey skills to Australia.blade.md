<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui teenager Jimi Blinkhorne returns to Melbourne on Boxing Day to lend his considerable skills once again to the Mordiallic Roller Hockey Club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 16-year-old was invited to play for Mordiallic's under-17 side at last January's Australia Day national Club Championships tournament where the talented striker was a major factor in their win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On that trip he also played for a senior men's team for a New Plymouth club that failed to flatter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have been invited back to help the Mordiallic under-17 team defend their club title and I'm looking forward to using some of the skills I learned while on an international training camp in Spain earlier this year," Blinkhorne said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Australia Day tournament runs on January 17-21, but Blinkhorne leaves on Boxing Day to spend time with an Aussie mate he travelled to Spain with.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui High School student completed a month-long roller hockey training camp in La Coruna in northwestern Spain with Ash Clee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was on his last Australian trip Blinkhorne and Mordiallic under-17 captain and good mate Ash Clee hatched the plan to attend the training camp in Spain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Ash has invited me to go camping with him and his family before the tournament. he won't be playing for the Mordiallic under-17s this time, so we won't be in the same sides this time round."</p>
