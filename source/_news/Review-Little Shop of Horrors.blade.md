<p>A cult classic rampages on a three week run with Little Shop of Horrors at Amdram Theatre.</p>
<p><em>Little Shop of Horrors<br />Amdram Theatre<br />Written by Howard Ashman<br />Music by Alan Menken<br />Directed by Colin Hedivan<br />Musical Directors Lynn Whiteside and Errol Christiansen<br />Choreography by Bee Kirk<br /><strong>Reviewed by Aaron Potaka</strong></em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A cult classic rampages on a three week run with Little Shop of Horrors at Amdram Theatre. The 1982 musical play is an adaption of the low-fi sci-fi film of the same name made twenty years earlier by King of Schlock, Roger Corman, and both inspiring a 1986 film remake. This play has pedigree and sireage of the highest order.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Corman connoisseurs can expect meek orphan hero Seymour Krelborn entering into Faustian Pact with mutant trash-talking crazed Venus fly-trap from outer-space. And then it gets a little left-field as Amdram's tightly-grafted production unfolds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chris Pedley as Seymour Krelborn and <strong>Shaila Hawkins</strong> (former WHS student) as the object of his crush, Audrey, lead a cast through two acts and eighteen songs straight from off-Broadway. Little Shop of Horrors is bigger than Mars in casting, set, and orchestration, and Amdram's production punches well above their weight with style and succeeds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Musical directors Lynn Whiteside and Errol Christiansen and choreographer Bee Kirk wrangle their cast through a demanding set of music and performances. A "Greek chorus" of Skid Row street urchins (Cypress Kani-Hurinui, Ali Gammeter, and Abby Squire) unveil the narrative with sass and svelte, and "Ya Never Know" is their stand-out. Dwight Ballard as Mr Mushnik, pulls of the song "Mushnik and Son", with a big belting duet with Mr Pedley that eclipses the sun. Richard Leith as Orin Scrivello, dentist and evil boyfriend to Audrey, takes dying on stage to a new level with "Now (Just the Gas)".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The acknowledged hit of the show is Audrey II, installed first as odd pot-plant with a je ne sais que quality, it progressively grows to epic proportions matching his evil quest for world domination. The product of his own cast of constructors, including Yvonne Jones and designer Kirk Nicolls, Audrey II brings the house down. His song "Feed Me (Git It)" oozes a mix of the devil and the Motown sound. Voiced by Dylan Peterson, with Phil Portland as puppeteer, Audrey II has a presence that cannot be avoided.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Director Colin Hedivan </strong>(WHS teacher) must applaud his cast and crew for a classy and colourful production. Little Shop of Horrors starts of small, but intends to take over the world, packing everything from cleverly designed sets, lively orchestration, fancy-stepping song and dance, sparkling performances, and the plus-sized vegetable-villain Audrey II, with hardly a missed beat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Upcoming performances - 22nd, 23rd, 29th and 30th. September at 7.30pm and a 2pm Matinee, Sunday, 24th September.</strong></p>
