<p><span>LAB RATS: Year 10 Wanganui High School student Levi Carroll is put through his paces by sport scientist Professor Steve Stannard while school mates look on in the Massey mobile laboratory yesterday.</span></p>
<p>A caravan laden with hi-tech scientific equipment aimed at the sporting fraternity debuted in Wanganui yesterday.</p>
<p>The caravan is a Massey University mobile exercise science laboratory designed to measure and analyse levels of fitness, strength, speed, heart and lung capacity and blood and urine samples.</p>
<p>The mobile unit parked up at Inspire Gym in Wanganui yesterday at the invitation of the River City Health Trust.</p>
<p>Professor Steve Stannard of the School of Sport and Exercise and Professor of Exercise Physiology at Massey, said while the mobile unit had been fitted earlier in the year, yesterday was its first official outing.</p>
<p>"It has a number of functions, but basically it is a fully equipped laboratory that can measure and analyse almost every aspect of fitness and sporting activity," Stannard said.</p>
<p>"It will also allow our students to conduct their practical components off campus and out in the world."</p>
<p>The mobile unit, carrying 3.5 tonne of scientific equipment when fully loaded, was an ideal portable laboratory to park up at iconic sporting venues such as Lake Karapiro or triathlon courses.</p>
<p>Stannard said it was also a moving billboard advertising Massey University's many scientific programmes.</p>
<p>Yesterday Stannard explained what the laboratory offered and demonstrated comprehensive testing of athletes to visiting individuals and groups, including students from Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>Later in the evening Stannard was involved in a sport nutrition workshop.</p>
