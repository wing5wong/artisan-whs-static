<p class="element element-paragraph">The future is looking much clearer for one Training For You student, thanks to a qualification, the colour purple and a well-timed phone call.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mason Coker, 19, graduated with a National Certificate in Early Childhood Education which he celebrated with nine fellow students at a ceremony in Heritage House recently.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coker identifies with Irlen Syndrome, which is a condition that causes the brain to have difficulty processing the full spectrum of white light.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Irlen sufferers usually have a strong sensitivity to the glare that comes off white paper, sunlight and to fluorescent lighting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One of the worst experiences for Coker is when the weather is overcast.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The light comes off the clouds straight into my eyes and makes it really hard to stay focused because I feel a kind of headache in my eyes before it goes into my brain," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another challenge is facing artificial light sources.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It can almost feel like my eyes are going to melt after a good hour or so of watching TV or using a computer screen."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Irlen Syndrome is a hereditary condition, it affects both males and females equally and can skip generations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is not an optical problem, but is related to the way the brain processes visual information.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After learning of Coker's situation, Learning For You tutor Michaela Newman told learning support adviser Chris Robson, who put an individual support plan in place for him.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One strategy to overcome the Syndrome is the Irlen method of intervention, this identifies which colour or colour combination will filter the offending light waves for the individual.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Newman began providing Coker with different coloured paper options and he was able to identify mauve as the one that provided the most clarity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, senior Irlen screener Prue Deighton contacted Robson to ask about students who could be helped by charitable trusts that are available to assist Irlen Syndrome sufferers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coker travelled to a Palmerston North optometrist twice &ndash; once for a full vision test and again for the Irlen diagnostic appointment, which determined his individual filter colour.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After a three week process, Coker took ownership of a bespoke pair of Irlen glasses, specially made with purple-coloured filters.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The main thing I was stressing out about was how to get to Palmerston North, but Chris definitely made it easy," Coker says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I do love the colour purple a lot, I'm guessing because it is more calming to my brain. I was able to try a whole range of colours and keep testing until I found the combination that is perfect for me."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The effect of the Irlens glasses was immediate, Coker has found himself reading faster than he ever has before.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has been easier for my brain to process what I am seeing and Chris mentioned that my writing is looking better as well," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It definitely does affect my mood, my mum has noticed that I'm happier now. You don't really notice how good or bad your eyesight is or how things feel until you have the improvement."</p>
