<p>TERTIARY SKILLS: &nbsp;UCOL transition manager Jaime Court (left with award-winning students Daniel Taurua, <strong>WHS student</strong> <strong>Scott Gray</strong> and co-ordinator Debbie Smith.</p>
<p>Wanganui high school students are among 250 young people from across the central North Island to have celebrated gaining NCEA credits by attending UCOL one day a week this year.</p>
<p>Through the U-Skills Central Schools Academy, Year 11, 12 and 13 students studied across a range of programme areas at UCOL sites in Wanganui, Palmerston North, Wairarapa and Levin in 2015.</p>
<p>Students received awards of recognition at ceremonies held in the four locations last month. U-Skills Central Schools Academy is a Trades Academy that is run through UCOL.</p>
<p>Transition manager Jaime Court says U-Skills programmes are designed to support students' school work and help them achieve NCEA through tertiary learning one day a week.</p>
<p>"U-Skills began in 2012 with 80 students, and we have grown every year since then," she said.</p>
<p>"The academy offers students a range of opportunities including credits towards NCEA and industry exposure as well as building their confidence and soft skills."</p>
<p>Wanganui students studied at UCOL campuses across a wide range of programme areas in categories such as manufacturing and technology, construction and infrastructure, services, social and community, primary and creative.</p>
<p>Ms Court says U-Skills programmes are designed to guide students through a vocational pathway with the support of school.</p>
<p>"Students are able to experience industry and tertiary training at the same time as completing NCEA. The academy offers students the option to develop tertiary study skills within the comfort of their secondary school."</p>
<p>There are no programme fees for U-skills and students are encouraged to ask for support from their schools to enrol for next year.</p>
