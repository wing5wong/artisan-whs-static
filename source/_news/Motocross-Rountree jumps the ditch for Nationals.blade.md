<p>WHS student, James Rountree will test himself at the Australian Junior nationals next week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui teenager James Rountree is heading across the ditch to compete at the Australian Junior Motocross Nationals this weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 15-year-old still qualifies for the Year 12-14 division due to his birthday being after January 1, and will be testing himself on the course in the regional city of Horsham, in Victoria.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Antony Rountree said over 500 juniors will take part in the five day event, starting Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Year 11 Whanganui High School student was fifth in the 125cc class of his age group at the New Zealand Junior Motocross Nationals in New Plymouth in April.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He also had Top 3 placings at the various club motocross series at Whanganui, New Plymouth, Gold Coast (NZ) and Taupo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Antony Rountree said there will be 16 juniors from New Zealand going over, six of them in James' 125cc class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sixty-four have entered his class, where he has to make the Top 40 to qualify for the three finals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is all new for us and we are going in there with a open mind and using it more for experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But first thing is to qualify for the finals and then see what happens from there - we hear the Aussie boys are quick, so it will be interesting."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Practice days begin on Saturday, with racing proper getting underway on the Monday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Rountree's shipped their bike over in a container with nine other bikes around three weeks ago and have been informed they arrived at the track.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sponsors include to Harvey Round Isuzu, Protecta Insurance, Bike Torque, Dirt Bike Repairs and JCR Yamaha.</p>
