<p>The best of the best Performing Arts students took to the stage at The Royal Wanganui Opera House on 2&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Kapahaka, Pasifika, Rockquest groups, singers, Ethan Mancer (selected for the NZSS Brass Band) dancers fresh form The Dancenzmade competitions, duelling pianos and drama students shone on stage.</p>
<p>Many students experienced a tinge of sadness as they performed for the last time as 2017 graduates and the Performing Arts Department will certainly miss their energy and talents.</p>
<p>We thank you for all your time and enjoyment you have given to the school and wider community.</p>
<p>Roll on 2018 Arts Concert and watch out NZ&hellip;it&rsquo;s Stage Challenge time and we will be making sure that we retain our National winning title!</p>
