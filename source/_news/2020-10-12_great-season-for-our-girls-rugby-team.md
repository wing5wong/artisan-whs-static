**Great season for our Girls Rugby Team playing in two competitions. They played in the Manawatu Comp finishing in Top 4 and the Wanganui 10 aside comp finishing runners up!** 💛💚🏉

They now head to New Plymouth on Saturday to compete in the Regional Girls Condor 7 qualifiers against Sacred Heart and New Plymouth Girls High. 
Good luck team! 💚💛🏉
