Our Whanganui delegation representing Whanganui High School - International, Whanganui Girls' College International and Cullinane College visited Tomita High School in Gifu, Japan yesterday. Our schools are looking forward to hosting Tomita High School students for short term three-month programmes of study, with the potential for one-year programmes opening up in the future.
