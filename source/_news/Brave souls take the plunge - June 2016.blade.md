<p>SEA NYMPHS: Whanganui High School Year 13 students (from left) Abby Hurley, Jadzia Morris, Hypatia Orchard and Sapere Simon got wet rather than wedded at the midwinter swim at Castlecliff Beach yesterday.</p>
<p>They came, they plunged, they shivered at the annual midwinter swim at Whanganui's Castlecliff Beach yesterday.</p>
<p>And while we're only a couple of days shy of the shortest day of the year, the weather was quite benign. Apart from a blustery wind, conditions were certainly not arctic-like. The More FM Polar Plunge started with about 100 brave swimmers from in front of the surf club pavilion.</p>
<p>Swimmers were confined to a small section of the beach under the watchful eye of a couple of surf lifesavers who made sure no one went out further than waist-deep into pretty turbulent surf.</p>
<p>Participants were encouraged to dress up and there were prizes for the best and wackiest costumes.</p>
<p>There were more than $400 worth of prizes given away thanks to the generosity of local businesses.</p>
<p>Whangaehu dairy farmer Jules Le Lievre was one of those who dressed up for the occasion, although no one was sure if he was Superman or Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>He had done the midwinter swim years ago but decided to make a return this year.</p>
<p>"It was colder back then, I can tell you. Must be El Nino or something," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't do this normally. Call it a moment of madness. But I might do it again next year."</p>
<p>And Year 13 Whanganui High School students Abby Hurley, Jadzia Morris, Hypatia Orchard and Sapere Simon got wet rather than wedded at the midwinter swim at Castlecliff Beach yesterday.</p>
<p>They all wore bridal veils and carried a posy of flowers.</p>
