<p><span>LEGGING IT: <strong>Emma Rainey</strong> claimed the U19 girls race at the annual Wanganui High School cross-country at the new venue Virginia Lake.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui High School is on track to begin selection of athletes to compete at next week's Whanganui Secondary Schools Cross Country after hosting its own annual event at Virginia Lake on Tuesday.</p>
<p>WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said the new venue and a lucky break in the weather allowed for some good results in each age group from the close to 300 athletes competing.</p>
<p>"We were lucky with the break in the weather we had for our event which helped make it a pleasant day for all," Murphy said.</p>
<p>"We will now be selecting our runners to go to the Whanganui Secondary School Cross-country at Collegiate Golf Course next Thursday. We are building up a nice squad of runners at WHS, with teacher in charge Stacey Hildreth working with them.</p>
<p>"Stacey is also looking forward to taking a good contingent of runners to the NZSS champs in Rotorua in June," Murphy said.</p>
<p>New Zealand hockey representative and all-round sportswoman Emma Rainey took out the U19 girls race, while <strong>Louis Hogan</strong> beat home his brother Flynn in the U19 boys.</p>
<p>Murphy suggested the majority of the podium-finishing athletes in each grade would gain selection for next week's event.</p>
<p><strong>WHS Results: </strong></p>
<p>U15 Girls Rebecca Baker 1st, Amber Andrews 2nd, Sara Stuart 3rd.</p>
<p>U15 Boys Travis Bayler 1st, Sam Luff 2nd, Connor Munro 3rd.</p>
<p>U16 Girls Kayla-Lee Wainwright 1st, Monique Cleeve 2nd, Rebekah Chamberlain-Butters 3rd.</p>
