**Congratulations to Paris Moore who was awarded the AFM Trophy today.**

The AFM Award is presented in memory of Debbie Mahoney who was a former student of Whanganui High School between 1984 and 1988 who passed away in 2018 at home in Cranbrook, Canada after a long illness. 

Debbie strongly believed in “fairness” in life which is why she believed everyone who goes through five years of high school education deserved a chance. This is why the award is made to a randomly chosen Year 13 student at Whanganui High School.  There are no stipulations on what the money should be spent on. Debbie was a very kind and generous person who would help anyone who needed it and believed that after 5 years at high school the recipient could decide themselves what best to do with the money.

We could not run the planned assembly due to Covid-19 restrictions, and as the family had travelled to Whanganui we decided to carry out the draw as planned in Mrs Spooner’s office.  The Trophy was presented to Paris by Debbie’s sister Jo Mahoney, brother Steve Mahoney and his wife Mary.
