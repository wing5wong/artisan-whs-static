<p><span>During his time at Cullinane College, principal Kevin Shore opened the renovated learning centre.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After 29 years working in education in Whanganui, Cullinane College principal Kevin Shore is moving to Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Shore has been appointed principal of St Peter's College, a co-educational Catholic secondary school, and takes up the position in March. The student body of about 650 is twice the size of Cullinane College.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've really enjoyed my time in the Cullinane community," Mr Shore said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a fantastic group of parents and whanau who have been very supportive. I've enjoyed the whole community strengthening in the time I've been principal."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Shore had previously been deputy principal at Cullinane's predecessor, St Augustine's College, before moving to <strong>Whanganui High School as assistant principal and then deputy principal.</strong> He has been principal at Cullinane for about eight years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've spent all of my 29 years in education working in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This appointment will probably be my last role and we'll be moving to Palmerston North because it's too big a job to be commuting from Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cullinane's board of trustees is in the process of recruiting a new principal.</p>
