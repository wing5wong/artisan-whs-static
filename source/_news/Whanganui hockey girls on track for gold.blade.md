<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui under 15 girls hockey team took a step closer to gold when they dispatched titleholders Canterbury 3-2 at the National U15 Hockey Championship in Timaru on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They then went out in the afternoon session and demolished Hawkes Bay 6-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Jan Dixon praised her girls for not only handling the pressure of playing up to two games a day, but also for combining on the field to win against strong opposition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm surprised were were in the same pool as Canterbury actually. They only just beat us the final last year," Dixon said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But today we up early and had them immediately on the back foot to come away with a 3-2 win. All the girls are playing well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School ace Rebecca Baker was again a star turn scoring all three of Wanganui's goals against Canterbury hot on the heels of a hat-trick during Monday's 4-0 drubbing of Manawatu B.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She then slotted two more against Hawkes Bay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They tackle Thames Valley on Wednesday morning and victory will certainly cement a spot in the semi-finals if that has not already occurred.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">If they top Pool A it will pit them against the third placed in Pool C in cross over play on Thursday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the Wanganui under 15 boys had to amuse themselves all day yesterday before a late encounter with Canterbury at their nationals in Invercargill.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A nil-all draw means they need to win On Tuesday against West Coast to ensure them a spot in the quarter finals on Thursday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Andrew Spence was also happy with the performance of his team after smashing Wellington 6-zip on Monday.</p>
