<p><strong>Some of the WHS staff members canoeing on the Whanganui River.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Whanganui High School staff canoed down river from Aramoho Top Ten Camp area to Putiki Marae in two groups of about 60 last Tuesday and Wednesday. It was more than just enjoying the physical exercise of paddling on a lovely summer&rsquo;s day. It was also an opportunity for staff to get to know others while doing something together.</p>
<p>High School has a staff of 100 teachers and 40 support staff including teacher aides, reception and caretaker/grounds staff. With these large numbers it is not easy to know all, even most of your colleagues. The suggestion for a &lsquo;bonding/getting to know others&rsquo; session had been made before and new principal Martin McAllen was already thinking along these lines when he received the request.</p>
<p>Lisa Martin, Head of Physical Education and Health, organised things working in with Ash Patea of Ki Tai Tours, who was a previous student at High School. There were a range of waka and canoes, including a 20-person traditional waka. The boats gathered together at intervals and Ash&rsquo;s colleague, George Matthews following behind in a motor boat, would talk to them about the traditions and history of the river.</p>
<p>There was also, according to teacher Jill Gregory, &ldquo;a bit of competition trying to paddle faster or splashing your colleague&rsquo;s canoe. She adds &ldquo;it was a lot of fun. Great camaraderie. Canoes would draw up to the one where Martin, the principal was on, saying, &ldquo;Can we do something like this with our new form classes next year?&rdquo; (High School will be switching to new vertical forms next year, containing students from year nine through to year 13).</p>
<p>The buzz created on the day continued. Jill says &ldquo;walking around the school you meet your fellow paddlers and smile and greet each other.&rdquo; Principal Martin said that &ldquo;it gave you a real connection with the river. You also saw Whanganui from a different perspective from what you get driving or walking. It was good to mix with staff that you don&rsquo;t always mix with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school did it over two days because of the numbers, but also to allow adequate teaching and supervision of nine and ten year classes still at school.</p>
<p>Principal Martin said that he is hoping to have more Marae based activities for staff in the future.</p>
