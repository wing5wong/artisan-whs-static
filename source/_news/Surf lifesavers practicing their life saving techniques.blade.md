<p><span>Surf lifesavers Clarissa Nowak and Alex Furlong, both WHS students, were practising their life saving techniques at Castlecliff this week.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"New and experienced lifeguards have started getting into shape and brushing up their skills to be ready to ensure the safety of the beach-going public," he said. "They will be practising their swimming, towing and rescue techniques every Sunday morning throughout the summer."</p>
<p>Patrols start from December 19 and there will be lifeguards on the beach every day, except Christmas day, until the end of January.</p>
<p>Mrs Miller said the club is always on the look out for strong swimmers who would like to train as lifeguards and training starts in October each year.</p>
