<p><strong>WHS students first/second in the Whanganui River Challenge. Cambell Tanner came first, followed by Jack Clifton.<br /></strong></p>
<p>The kayakers headed north and the rowers headed south and they all converged on Taupo Quay for the 2016 edition of the seventh annual Whanganui River Challenge yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Around 25 kayak, ski surf and waka craft of various crew sizes entered the traditional 13km race, starting at the Union Boat Club and initially heading south down the city, before turning back for a loping course which took them under Whanganui's three town bridges and Corliss (Rabbit) Island.</p>
<p>Working together were Whanganui Multisport club members <strong>Cambell Tanner and Jack Clifton</strong> in their K1's, along with the K2 crew of Brian and Robyn Scott.</p>
<p>After the 10.15am, they worked their way back past the UBC wharf on their way north at 10.52am, as it was clear someone was going to break from the group when they turned for the final time to come south again.</p>
<p><strong>The 17-year-old Tanner was that man, getting line honours in 1h 6m 49s, followed 19s later by Clifton</strong> with the Scott's right behind him.</p>
<p>"It was pretty cold," Tanner said of the morning conditions.</p>
<p>"I stayed with the mixed K2 and Jack Clifton, we just wash-rode together.</p>
<p>"It helped to stay less tired...then dropped them at the end."</p>
<p><strong>There was a good double for the family as sister (and former WHS student) Erica Tanner, 19, was the fastest female in 1h 14m 10s, coming seventh overall.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With a smile, Cambell agreed its always satisfying to beat his older sister.</p>
<p>Up stream at the Upokongaro Wharf, 10 rowing crews entered the 10km race back down to UBC, with results decided by prognostic time - the highest percentage of the world record for each class of boat.</p>
<p>Aramoho Wanganui Rowing Club's veteran team of Trevor Rush and Richard Brock completed the course in 50m 22s, with a high 72 per cent prognostic to see off the composite AWRC crew of Pat Spriggens, Steph Rush, Tash Carver and Jacs Rush (69.77 per cent), while UBC's Pat Carroll was narrowly third (69.16 per cent).</p>
<p><strong>In the rowing coxed eights competition, the AWRC crew were the winners in 41m 3s at a 71.89 per cent prognostic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This was&nbsp;Niamh Mullany</strong>, Luke Watts, James Sandston, <strong>Hugh Pawson (former WHS student),</strong> <strong>Matthew Wright, Nathan Luff, Guy Thomson, Ben Tijsen-Cox, and Brodie Manson.</strong></p>
<p>Second was the Collegiate boys under 17 crew (69.09 per cent), with the AWRC's MGM crew third (69.99 per cent).</p>
<p>A 4km race was also held with 12 boat entries, and was won by Awa Paddlers Black waka crew in 32m 5.4s, with the multisport club's K2 team of <strong>Sophie Brooke and Katie Foster</strong> <strong>second by 4s, while K1 athlete Nanea Schurhammer was third.</strong></p>
<p>Event manager Aaron Cox thanked the organisers and everyone for taking part.</p>
<p>"Fantastic weather, fantastic times and a fantastic number of paddlers on the water.</p>
<p>"The more people who are on the water, makes it more of an event."</p>
