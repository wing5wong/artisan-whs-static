<p><span>(Poster designed by Taliah Su'a)<br />During week 7 of Term 2 (June 12-16)&nbsp;the Academic prefects have organised an International Languages Week to celebrate all the different languages and cultures that make up our extremely diverse community here at Whanganui High School!</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>During the week there will be many different activities held during break times including: foreign short films screened in the hall, international games played in the gym and on the turf and salsa classes held on Tuesday 13 June in the dance room.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The canteen will also be serving a delicious&nbsp;brand new menu for the duration of the week. As well as every morning there will be a quiz in the notices for form classes to answer.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Each form class will be awarded points for the quizzes and involvement in the other break time activities. At the end of the week the form class with the most points will win a pizza lunch prize!&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you<br /></span>Academic Prefects&nbsp;</p>
