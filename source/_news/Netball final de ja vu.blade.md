<p><strong>HUNGRY EYES: WHS wing defence Kerwyn Morgan shows the hunger she and her team had over Victoria Anstis (left) and her WA Sports team mates to make the finals of the Premier Netball championship.</strong></p>
<p>The final of the Whanganui Premier Netball Championship will be a mirror image of the last five years with both reigning champions Kaierau and Wanganui High School cementing their spots on Monday night.</p>
<p>The young Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School side showed a real hunger for the win over Wanganui Athletic Sports in the first semi-final. In a real nailbiter the match went right to the wire with WHS edging out a 45-43 winner.</p>
<p>In the second semi Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau easily won its match against championship debutants Mere Te Aroha 65-37, reflecting the dominance the defending titleholders have had all season.</p>
<p>Kaierau received a shake up in the final game of round robin play before the semi-finals when WA Sports toppled the previously unbeaten side in a 44-43 thriller.</p>
<p>However, Kaierau showed no complacency on Monday night winning the first two and the final quarters and drawing the third to run out convincing victors.<br />Kaierau had held the title for several years until WHS won back-to-back in 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>Kaierau then reclaimed the title last season and while probable pre-post favourites for the August 8 final, won't have an easy time against a determined, hungry young WHS side.</p>
<p>The WHS v WA Sports semi on Monday was an absolute thriller.</p>
<p>The nerves were obvious and certainly at the end of the day reflected in the shooting stats of the teams with WHS shooting at 68 percent and WA Sports 62 percent. The volume, however, was phenomenal with 135.</p>
<p>The game really could have gone either way.</p>
<p>WHS capitalised early on some basic errors from WA Sports and took both the first and second quarters 11-9 to lead 22-18 at the half-time break. WA Sports certainly had plenty of opportunities and won both the third and fourth quarters 15-14 and 10-9. But the gutsy youngsters showed more desire and cohesiveness throughout the court and were prepared to go the extra distance, contesting ball both on defence and attack. They came out hunting on defence and showed good patience.</p>
<p>WHS coach Lisa Murphy heaped praise on her young side that has six new players from last season, including three Year 10 14-year-oldies.</p>
<p>"I'm really proud of these girls. We talked about being hungry for the win at training and they certainly showed that on the night," Murphy said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to single anyone out because it really was a compete team effort on attack and defence."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WE Sports coach Trish Anstis conceded it was a game of missed opportunities for her girls.</p>
<p>"We had plenty of possession, but at certain times poor decision-making, and a lack of fitness cost us against a hungry WHS team," Anstis said.</p>
<p>"I must say the quality of the game was of a high standard and time and time again we pulled back to within a point. The team never gave up, but unfortunately we just didn't take our opportunities."</p>
<p>In the other semi, Kaierau put out a commanding performance against Mere Te Aroha.<br />Mere Te Aroha showed glimpses of hope, particularly in the third quarter where they drew 13 all, but it was otherwise an all Maroon affair. Quarter scores were 19-7 Kaierau, 31-15 Kaierau, 44-28 Kaierau and 65-37 Kaierau.</p>
<p>Taihape, sporting new uniforms, beat Mint Cafe Marist 45-41 in yet another close Monday night encounter to claim its plate final spot against Kaiwhaiki who went through after Cullinane defaulted. The college team was unable to field a full side with many player away on school kapa haka duties.</p>
<p>The played plate semi-final was a tight contest with Taihape winning the first quarter 12-11 and Marist the second 10-9 to leave the scores tied 21 a piece at half-time.<br />Marist edged ahead 33-32 at the three quarter break, but Taihape came back strong to win 45-41.</p>
<p>Marist will play Cullinane for 7th and 8th. Both these games will take place next Monday.</p>
<p><strong>The top four will now play their finals the following Monday (August 8)</strong> with WA Sports v Mere Te Aroha at 5.45pm and the <strong>Grand Final between Kaierau and WHS</strong> <strong>at 7.30pm.</strong> Door sales for grandstand seating will be available on the night for $5 per adult and $2 per student with under 5s free (must sit on parent/caregiver).</p>
<p>VIP courtside tables are also available for purchase from Netball Wanganui at $50 per person and include food and beverages.</p>
<p>Netball Wanganui chief executive Parekura Muraahi said a great evening is planned with celebrity guest, former Silver Fern Sandra Edge courtside to select the grand final match MVP.</p>
