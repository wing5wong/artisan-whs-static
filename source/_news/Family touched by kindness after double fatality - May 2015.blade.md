<p><span>MUM AND ME: The photograph of Jennifer and Zane Town used for their funeral service programme.</span></p>
<p>Support shown by people after a double fatality car accident has left the Town family flabbergasted - but in a good way.</p>
<p>Jennifer Town and her 14-year-old son Zane died on SH3 near Bulls on May 9 in the accident. Three other family members - Jennifer's son Hayden, daughter Rachel and grandson Lucas - were injured.</p>
<p>Husband of Jennifer and father of Zane, Willie Town, and father of Jennifer and grandfather of Zane, Denys Peck, came into the Chronicle offices on Thursday to express their thanks to the community. Willie is from Wanganui and Denys from Hamilton. They said from schools to neighbours to emergency services to businesses they have received overwhelming help and kindness.</p>
<p>"The students from Zane's school, (Wanganui) High School, have been fundraising, childcare providers Porse and Paua have been marvellous, Harrison's Hire erected a marquee on the lawn on the Sunday without asking for free, neighbours and the local marae have supplied so much food and cooking," said Denys.</p>
<p>The hire company also donated portable cookers, trestles and other equipment while the High School also erected a large tent for the overflow for the Town family's's Gonville house.</p>
<p>"Gonville School within a day had sorted food parcels, there's just been so much free food."</p>
<p>"Someone gave us a chest freezer - an actual freezer, full of food," said Willie.</p>
<p>"It's a real tangi."</p>
<p>Denys said the community has also supplied much needed comfort.</p>
<p>"Every lunch and tea we've had 50 to 60 school kids round here, they are here at night time and they were very welcome. We had people here all the time to help out. Our family from all over New Zealand and even Australia were just overwhelmed with the community support. It was unbelievable."</p>
<p>Considerable fundraising has been organised by students and others for the family including designing special T-shirts. A Givealittle page has been set up.</p>
<p>The local KartSport New Zealand-affiliated club, KartSport Manawatu, has also been a rock for them. Zane was a club member, while Jennifer had strong ties to childcare and early childhood groups in Wanganui.</p>
<p>High school students participated in the funeral service for Jennifer and Zane, and the fact the school closed for half a day was also very much appreciated.</p>
<p>"The students practised every day for the haka done at the service," said Denys.</p>
<p>"We are very grateful and we just want to say thanks to everyone but don't know how to.</p>
<p>"And we don't want to miss anyone out, so thanks to everyone," said Denys.</p>
<p>A friend of truck driver Willie loaned a car for as long as they need it and support from his workmates at Dairy Fresh has been "huge"</p>
<p>"That's the Dairy Fresh family - all of them" he said.</p>
<p>Family members hurt in the accident are slowly recovering.</p>
<p>Willie's daughter Rachel, 22, will have her leg in plaster for two months and will not be fully recovered for another four months after that, with the help of physio.</p>
<p>Six-year-old Hayden is doing half days back at Carlton School and is expected to go back to school full time any day.</p>
<p>Willie remarks that Hayden is "brutally honest" about what has happened to them.</p>
<p>Willie says the hearts of family members also go out to the emergency services that attended the accident. And they acknowledge the help that was provided swiftly and compassionately by both motorists and first responders.</p>
<p>"Fortunately two of the first cars along contained a retired paramedic and a nurse.</p>
<p>"We are so thankful a member of the Fire Brigade sat with Jennifer and Zane until their bodies were taken away.</p>
<p>"The police have been tremendous, absolutely brilliant; the ambulance people who were with Rachel - I just can't say enough."</p>
<p>-Media reports that Mr Town drove past the crash scene and recognised it was his family are incorrect. He was phoned by police when he was in Levin.</p>
