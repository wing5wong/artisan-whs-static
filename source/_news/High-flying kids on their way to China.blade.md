<p class="element element-paragraph">Twenty-eight Whanganui High School students are about to find out what life as part of a Chinese family is really like.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Year 9 to 13 students left for China on Saturday to visit sister school students. They are accompanied by International Dean Lee Su'a, Chinese teacher Beck Ding and Kapa Haka teacher Lynaire Simon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"Whanganui High School is one of 10 schools in New Zealand that won funding from Education New Zealand towards visiting their sister schools in China," Whanganui High School Director of International Students Alexandra Ferretti said.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"With this prize, Whanganui High School will be able to meet some of the Xuzhou students who have visited Whanganui and see what real life in a Chinese family is all about. Our students will stay in a homestay with a buddy, get to have a look around Xuzhou and gain insight into Chinese culture.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This will be the first time some of these young people have been on a trip like this."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The group will travel to Xiamen, Beijing and Xuzhou. Whanganui High School hosts about 30 students from Xuzhou every year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Su'a said members of the school's Kia Whaiora group would give performances in poi, haka and waiata.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It will be very special because the waiata was written by [the late] Morvin Simon," Su'a said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have connections with the different places we are going to through our Confucius Classroom. It's very exciting for me to meet up with past students from China who we will see over there."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The group returns on October 9, with a trip to Disneyland, Shanghai, marking the end of the trip.</p>
