Tahiti 2025

Today we met up after two days away from the group. Students stayed with their homestays for two days and had a fantabulous time watching cultural shows, swimming, eating delicious food etc ... 

Today we went to a coral preservation association and learnt how the Tahitians are working to preserve the coral in their lagoon - Kaitiaki o te taio. Everyone got to name a piece of coral and it was put in a coral nursery to be placed in a coral nursery and then planted in the reef to make it stronger. Te kino kÄ› hoki. ðŸ¤©
