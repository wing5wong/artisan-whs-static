<h4>SOPHIA 'UNGA-CRIBB<br />WINNNER - Junior English section for Manu Korero Nationals 2018.</h4>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NG</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ā</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> MANU KORERO NATIONAL SPEECH COMPETITION 2018</span></strong></p>
<p>This year our Junior English speaker Sophia &lsquo;Unga-Cribb came away with first place at our Aotea Regional Manu Korero competition held in Waitara in term 2. As a result, we sent a small intimate roopu to the National Manu Korero speech competition held in Gisborne at the Houhoupiko Events Centre. The powhiri for the event was held on Tuesday the 18<sup>th</sup> of September. This was a moving powhiri by the hosts Turanganui-a-Kiwa as all recipients from Manu Korero returned the trophies and the mauri (essence) that comes with them.</p>
<p>Day one started the senior Maori and English speakers. We began with impromptu speeches and the quality was very high in both sections. We were proud to stand as the Aotea Region to support the Senior Māori speaker from Cullinane College and the Senior English speaker form Opunake High school.</p>
<p>On day two it was all about the Juniors. With a reverse order from the seniors yesterday this meant we wouldn&rsquo;t stand until after lunch so we kept our Sophia at home to allow her space and time while went to sus out her competition. Then finally came the time for Sophia to stand and deliver her speech alongside the Junior Māori speaker from Te Kura Kaupapa Māori o Ngaruahinerangi. Once again we took the stage as Aotea with the support of all our schools. Our Sophia stood with mana, so much pride and delivered an excellent speech that was based on 10 ways to teach her. I think it is safe to assume the judges agreed as we got to the prize giving for her section and AE MARIKA! We won!!! Then her kuia called a beautiful karanga and her small intimate roopu stood to honour her with a moving haka that had us in tears of joy. They stood to honour her so proudly and we were supported by the other whanau and schools from our whanganui area. This was a moving experience for all something we will never forget.</p>
<p>As a result we returned to Whanganui as the winners of the Junior English section for Manu Korero Nationals 2018. To you Sophia, you have done your whanau, Hapu and Iwi so proud being the third recipient from your Cribb family to receive Koro Taa Turi Kara. What a beautiful legacy for you and all of us. Thank you for allowing us to be a part of it.</p>
