<p class="element element-paragraph">Rick Baum's latest project pulls together an eclectic group of Whanganui musicians.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Formally of Clasmatic Boogie Orchestra, Baum has written and produced the EP&nbsp;<em>You Never Know</em>&nbsp;under the banner Bad Boy Bloom.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baum has done a lot of work as an arranger in the past but recently turned his hand to songwriting with this recording.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's one that's been kicking around for a long time, to actually get together a group of musicians and record original stuff."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The six-song EP features four original tracks written and composed by Baum along with two covers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Much of the EP was recorded last year at the Savage Club Hall and in Baum's kitchen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year has been spent mixing and producing the tracks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a pop/funk CD but I wanted it to have a little bit more hard-edged than we'd been doing with Clasmatic Boogie Orchestra."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baum was writing new material and hoped to start recording again in January.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The feedback we've got has been good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bad Boy Bloom is made up of Aydie Holland (vocals), Clyde Dixon and Tracy Wilson (trumpets), Oscar Laven, (tenor sax), Rick Baum (trombone), John Steedman (baritone sax), <strong>Te Paerata Tichbon</strong> <strong>(guitar)</strong>, Maynard Mason (bass) and <strong>Michael Petersen</strong> <strong>(drums)</strong>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The new release is available on Spotify, iTunes and Google Play. People can listen to, purchase, and follow the group at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.badboybloom.com/music/" target="null">www.badboybloom.com</a></p>
