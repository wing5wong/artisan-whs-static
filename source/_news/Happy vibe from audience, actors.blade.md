<p><span>HAPPY ENDING: Like all good pantomimes, Red Riding Hood ends well. <br />PICTURE: Lizz Hudson</span></p>
<p>There comes a time in the life of any stage production after weeks in rehearsal that the cast needs an audience, a response to their performances. The cast of&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>, opening their pantomime on Friday, December 9, were truly ready for their audience, the laughter, cheers and booing the villain.</p>
<p>I'm writing this on Saturday morning, remembering last night's opening and as I do so I'm smiling. I smile because I'm proud to be associated with such a talented group, the band, the production team and of course the actors, who, for the most part, are youngsters with some more mature actors balancing the mix. I smile because I'm remembering their vitality, their sparkle and the sheer joy they conveyed.</p>
<p>Judging by the audience response, they felt that happy vibe too. It's not all one-sided though. Make no mistake, the cast respond to the audience as much as the audience react to the on stage performance. It's definitely a two-way street.</p>
<p>Encouraged by early tips from Grandma and Sir Roger, our engaged audience cheered the hero, booed the 'baddy', laughed at all the jokes and clapped in time to the music right from the opening number.</p>
<p>Michael Frayn got the idea for&nbsp;<em>Noises Off</em>, a play about all the funny things that happen backstage, while watching one of his plays from the wings. It's often as funny backstage as it is on stage. Sometimes it's frantic. "Where's the blowpipe?" "It's here. Chill out!"</p>
<p>Quick costume changes are sometimes the cause of hilarity, smothered snorts of mirth in the wings ... Grandma has to get into her beautiful evening gown (plus her boots), 'Wolfie' needs to quickly get into a nightie while sporting a rapidly expanded tummy. 'Wolfie' needs help to get her night cap on as she's inclined to get it on at an interesting angle which always tickles my funny bone. Morris and Boris have a lot of quick changes which they manage brilliantly with assistance from Linda Hardcastle and Marion Campbell.</p>
<p>That's one of the things I love about theatre. Everyone has a part to play on stage or off stage. Everyone is a necessary part of a whole while under Colin Hedivan's skilled guidance it was a whole lot of fun and laughter. Well done team!</p>
