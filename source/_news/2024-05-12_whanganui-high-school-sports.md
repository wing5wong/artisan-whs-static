Congratulations to Finn Lennox who came 5th in NZ in the 15-16 125cc class at the NZ Junior Nationals Motocross Championship.

Finn competed in the 3 day event held at Flips just outside of Foxton, battling against 25 others from all around NZ for a top spot.

After qualifying 6th he managed to finish 7th, 8th, 7th, 4th & 5th in the 5 races that followed. Giving him enough points to place 5th.

Well [](<>)done Finn!
