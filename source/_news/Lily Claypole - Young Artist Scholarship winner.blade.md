<p class="element element-paragraph">Selecting a winner from 22 worthy entries in the Fine Arts Whanganui Young Artist Scholarship was not an easy task for judges.</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Ten finalists were selected and judges Riah King-Wall, Christodoulos Moisa and Sietske Jansma named <strong>Lily Claypole</strong> as the winner on Friday.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"All the entries were good and it was not easy to narrow it down and then select one winner," said King-Wall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Claypole won a $1000 cash prize sponsored by Whanganui Fine Arts members and she will hold a solo exhibition at the Taupo Quay Gallery in 2019.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The work is part of my NCEA portfolio - I based it on the work of Dutch Masters and my aim was to capture the colours and moods of the paintings."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young artist has just finished high school and said the award has come at a perfect time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was planning to stay in Whanganui this year so it has worked out well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I can put together work for my exhibition."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gallery visitors selected Ioane Wairua-Pohe Takiari's work to receive the People's Choice award sponsored by Andrew and Jane Toy of Furnique.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Fine Arts chairwoman Marie Grice said there were a lot of votes cast this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great to see such a good response and a number of entries got plenty of votes but there was one standout."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wairua-Pohe Takiari's symbolic series of three ink on paper works won him a $200 prize.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jane Toy, who was a founding member of the Whanganui Fine Arts Collective, said it is a pleasure to support the awards and help foster young talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I also want to congratulate the Whanganui Fine Arts Collective on their third birthday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There is a lot of effort goes into the gallery and the members do a fantastic job."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Mikayla Baldwin, winner of the inaugural Young Artist Scholarship in 2017 congratulated the 2018 winners and finalists.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She spoke of her "amazing year" and said exhibiting and selling her work has given her huge confidence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The other finalists with work on show are <strong>Chantelle de Koning,</strong> Casey Roberts, Emma Hayward, Jai Tui, Ani Latus, Alison Edwards, <strong>Eugenia Lee</strong> and Chelsea Cameron.</p>
