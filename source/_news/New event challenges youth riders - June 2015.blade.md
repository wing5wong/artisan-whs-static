<p><span>CHAMPION STYLE: Wanganui Mountain Bike Club member and Wanganui High School student Lochie Steedman - current Manawatu under-17 winter series title-holder - navigates some cross-country terrain.</span></p>
<p>The call is going out to Wanganui intermediate and secondary school students to participate in an exciting new event created especially for their age group.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Mountain Bike Inter School Champs will take place on June 12 and will involve a cross-country challenge around Harakeke Park. It is a new biking event that will provide an opportunity for kids to have a go at a non-traditional sport in a fun and informal setting.</p>
<p>The inaugural event is the result of a collaboration between the Wanganui Mountain Bike Club and Sport Whanganui. In partnership, the two organisations are hoping to strengthen the link between mountain biking activities being offered in primary and intermediate schools, and those available when students move on to secondary school.</p>
<p>Sport Whanganui's bike development officer Norman Gruebsch comments: "It's about making a connection between the cycle skill development programmes that have been running for some time in the intermediate sector - with groups such as Whanganui Police and Wanganui Intermediate School - and encouraging mountain biking activities at secondary school level."</p>
<p>Gruebsch has noted the prevalent trend toward mountain biking as a cycling activity.<br />"Nationally, mountain biking is growing immensely," he said, noting the success of downhill mountain bikers Sam Blenkinsop and Ben Watkins. &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">"Interest is increasing, particularly with the parks and trails in the Whanganui region on our doorstep."</span></p>
<p>The initiative has support from national cycling body Bike Wise, and from local sponsors The Bike Shed and Velo Ronny's Bicycle Store.</p>
<p>The championship has a range of distances and categories to suit.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The shortest distance starts at 2km for the Year7-8 students, and the longest distance will be no more than 5km for the Year 11-13's. &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Students can race as individuals or in teams of any combination, and there are spot prizes along the way to encourage a relaxed, give-it-a-go atmosphere.</span></p>
<p>With an entry fee of just $2.00 per person, the organisers are expecting to see a good number of schools represented. Interest has already been received from Cullinane College, Wanganui City College, and Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>And for students that are keen to take part but don't own their own bike, there are a limited number available from Sport Whanganui which schools can apply for, on a first-in-first-served basis.</p>
<p>Registration for the event is through school sports co-ordinators. Closing date for entries is Tuesday 2nd June.</p>
