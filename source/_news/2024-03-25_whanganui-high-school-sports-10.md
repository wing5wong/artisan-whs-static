Our Boys Volleyball team had a win yesterday morning against Whakatāne B 2-1.

They then went on to play a tough game against Middleton Grange 2-1. The boys played well and kept fighting till the end.

Today they had some tough losses against Marlborough Boys HS and Onehunga HS B.

Unfortunately fatigue and injuries caught up to our boys after a long week of volleyball. But the boys didn't let that get to them as they are in good spirits after their game.

With [](<>)a cold ice cream and good warm down, who wouldn't be in a good mood. 

They have one more game tomorrow against Freyberg HS to finish of our tournament week before returning home.

Let's go WHS!!
