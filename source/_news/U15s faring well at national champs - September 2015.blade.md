<p>The Wanganui Under-15 boys and girls hockey teams are faring well at their respective national age-group championships.</p>
<p>Playing in Wellington the Andrew Spence-coached boys side has won two from two to go into a match against South Canterbury today to determine the pool winner. In their first match Wanganui played hosts Wellington winning 7-0.</p>
<p>Spence said his side took some time to settle, however after 10 minutes the floodgates opened and the boys had scored five goals by half-time.</p>
<p>In the second half the opportunity was given to allow all players a run.</p>
<p><strong>The Wanganui team at times played some sublime hockey, Spence said. Scorers were</strong> <strong>Tyler Nichol-Hilton</strong> <strong>(WHS), Jordan Cohen <strong>(WHS)</strong>, Ethan Cohen <strong>(WHS)</strong>&nbsp;and</strong> <strong>Travis Bayler</strong> <strong>(WHS)</strong>. <strong>Jimmi Blinkhorne</strong> <strong>(WHS) and Patrick Madder</strong> <strong>(WHS)</strong> scored two. Yesterday Wanganui expected to beat Southland and the boys duly obliged albeit a narrow 1-0 victory.</p>
<p>"Southland came out to play a very physical game that got under the boys' skin a bit, but we managed to compose ourselves to control the ball around," Spence said.</p>
<p><strong>Ronan Spence (WHS)</strong> scored the only goal, while goalkeeper Zac Farmer was tested to save one serious shot thanks to team play and the defensive skills of fullback <strong>Lachlan James</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(WHS)</strong>.</p>
<p>In Christchurch the Wanganui under-15 girls went down 5-0 to South Canterbury in their first game but bounced back with a 3-2 win over Central Otago.</p>
<p>Coach Jan Dixon said <strong>Rebecca Baker</strong> <strong>(WHS)</strong> played well scoring two goals while Garce Godfrey kicked in with a goal of her own.</p>
<p>"Those two girls had very good games as did Claudia Ryan, <strong>Imogen Burrows (WHS)</strong>&nbsp;and Jaz Manfield," Dixon said.</p>
