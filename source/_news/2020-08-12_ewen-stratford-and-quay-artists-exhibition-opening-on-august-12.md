Quay Artists started about two years ago with about six artists. The inspiration came from those who had done a Community Education course with artist, Pauline Allomes. It has grown, mainly by word of mouth, to over 20 artists who meet either on a Tuesday or Thursday.

Ewen has been painting and exhibiting for a number of years and normally invites other artists to join him in an exhibition. He is also a member of the group. Twelve of them will be involved in this exhibition which opens on August 12 at the Community Arts Centre on Taupo Quay and most will be exhibiting up to six pieces of art. They will be taking up the two exhibition spaces in the Centre.

There will be a huge variety of art on display from abstract to portraits to landscapes to art for young people. Likewise, with the different techniques from oils to water colours, wood cuts to mixed media to acrylics. All works are for sale and will be reasonably priced.

The exhibition will be open from 10am to 4pm Monday to Friday and from 10am to 1pm on the weekends. It runs until August 24. It will be a good opportunity to see the works of a variety of local artists.
