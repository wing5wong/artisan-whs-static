The Whanganui High School Annual Ball had the students enter an elaborately decorated ballroom at the Whanganui Racecourse on the evening of Saturday, the 8th of August. 

The night began with a delectable array of nibbles catered by the local business Pitter Platter, and a queue for the many photo opportunities, professional and student-led. 

The night was then filled with a constantly packed dance floor, and ending with the much-anticipated student awards.  

Thank you to the tireless group of student helpers, led by this year's Heads of Social, Mahina Barritt and Vincent Ye, who created the truly unforgettable night.

Best Dressed Male and Female - Jordyn Leiasamaivao-Turvey and Charlotte James  
Cutest Couple - Divnesh Dayal and Abbie Trillo  
Best Dancers - Sebastian Newton and Brooke Ryland
