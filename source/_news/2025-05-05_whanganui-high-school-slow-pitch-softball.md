ðŸ¥Ž The final games for the 24/25 slow pitch softball season were played on Monday. Due to a gap week for Summer Tournament week, there was only time for a round robin and no finals. Our Senior team faced the Cullinane seniors which would have been the Grand Final if there was one. Our boys and girls played an outstanding game, beating Cullinane 9-5 and coming away winning the competition. Our junior team showed great improvement throughout the season, finishing 5th in the comp.

Congratulations also to our team MVPs Shiloh Campbell (Seniors) and Max Stevens (Juniors), they were awarded a Pita Pit voucher ðŸ’šðŸ’›.

A huge thanks to our coaches and managers Stephen Barnes and Tara Baxter (juniors) and Kynan Brewer (player/coach) and his mum Jessie Madams (seniors). 

Thanks also to the Whanganui Softball Association for running a fantastic competition. See you next season ðŸ¥Ž
