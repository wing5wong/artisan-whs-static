<p>FAST FIVE:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Whanganui speed skaters (from left) <strong>Renee Teers</strong>, Drew Brennan, Andrew Jones (centre), Chase Morpeth and <strong>Monique Cleeve</strong> are expected to shine at the Oceania Championships in Timaru this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five Whanganui Speed Skaters are heading to Timaru over Easter as part of the New Zealand team to take on the Australians in the Oceania Speed skating Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In what is looking like the most evenly matched competition in the last few years the Whanganui skaters are likely to be key in deciding the outcome.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Andrew Jones is racing in the senior men's grade and his current form has been sensational. At the recent Laurie Hastie Cup in Palmerston North Jones went head-to-head with Peter Michael who was putting on his in-lines for the first time in months and racing indoors for the first time in four years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jones pipped the Olympian in two sprint races before Michael got down to business and showed his class for two emphatic wins in the distance events. In the absence of Michael, Jones completely dominated the outdoor races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Renee Teers and Monique Cleeve </strong>(present &amp; former student)&nbsp;are racing the junior girl's (Under 19) class and have been battling each other and the Timaru pair of Leah McDonald and Ariana Snook all season for honours as the top New Zealand female.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Cleeve</strong> won the road events at Laurie Hastie with <strong>Teers</strong> a close second. The four should lead a strong New Zealand challenge against a class Australian field in the most competitive grade at the competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chase Morpeth was a medal winner at last year's championship in the cadet boy's grade and this year is joined by Drew Brennan in his first international competition. Both have been in superb form sharing wins in their class at the Laurie Hastie Cup.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other Whanganui skaters to perform well at the Laurie Hastie cup were Lucas Hodgson, who won the juvenile boy's class on aggregate from Mickey Zhang with Josh Valentine turning up on the Sunday to run away with the outdoor events. Tazia Parker was impressive in the juvenile girl's grade despite several falls.</p>
