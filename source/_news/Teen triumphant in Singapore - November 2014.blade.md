<p>Wanganui teenager Millie Manning was unfazed by the heat of competition at the Singapore Prime Invitational gymnastics event this month.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Boys and Girls Gym Club gymnast won gold with her floor exercise and bronze on the vault against strong international company.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old Wanganui High School Year 11 student said she was struck by the heat Singapore is renowned for as soon as she walked out of the airport terminal doors, but was reassured when she arrived at the air-conditioned competition gymnasium.</p>
<p>"I couldn't believe the heat in Singapore, it was like walking into a wall when I left the airport," Manning said yesterday.</p>
<p>Talked into competing at a qualifying event this year by her club coach Kelly Taylor-Ward, Manning said she was doubtful of scoring enough points to gain selection to the New Zealand Development team to compete in Singapore.</p>
<p>"I didn't really expect to score enough points, but when I did I thought that was pretty cool."</p>
<p>Self-doubt, however, disappeared when competition began against athletes from Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and the 11-strong New Zealand gymnasts.</p>
<p>She was happy with her performances in such illustrious company and ecstatic she came away with gold and bronze.</p>
<p>"Beam has become my strongest discipline this year, but floor and vault are also quite good," she said.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, I fell off the beam. In fact, quite a few of our team did."</p>
<p>Manning said she had an inkling she might be in the hunt for gold as soon she completed her floor routine.</p>
<p>"As soon as I finished I kinda thought 'wow!' and my coach said it was the best he'd seen me tumble. When the 12.3 score came up I knew I'd go close to gold - it was unreal," she said.</p>
<p>The New Zealand team took out several gold, silver and bronze medals as well as a few team placings.</p>
<p>The team was accompanied by a Gymsports New Zealand-appointed coach, manager and judge who were delighted by the high standard of the New Zealand team.</p>
<p>James Keatley, the team coach, said: "Millie has really improved since the start of the year."</p>
<p>Wanganui club manager Julie Holden was thrilled with Manning's results. "I am very happy for her, she works very hard and she is a fantastic role model for the club. She is very deserving of her success."</p>
<p>Acknowledgment also went to Taylor-Ward who encouraged Manning to trial for the Singapore competition.</p>
<p>Manning and her family would like to express their thanks to the many individuals and local businesses in the Wanganui community who donated toward her trip.</p>
<p>"Without these generous people helping Millie reach her goal, this experience wouldn't have been possible," Holden said.</p>
