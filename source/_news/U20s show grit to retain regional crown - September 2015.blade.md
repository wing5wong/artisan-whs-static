<p>HARD EARNED: WHS student <strong>Daniel Kauika</strong> had another solid game at fullback and made good breaks out wide in the Wanganui Under-20s victory game at the International Rugby Academy in Palmerston North.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EACH member of the Wanganui Under-20s had to put in extra work shifts as they retained their HYRC Series crown against Wairarapa-Bush U20s, winning 31-24 at the International Rugby Academy in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Both sides had previously thrashed Horowhenua-Kapiti and the combined East Coast-Poverty Bay team in this Hurricanes region competition, making their meeting on Saturday a virtual final.</p>
<p>Wanganui, coached by Dennis Edwards and assisted by Darren Munro, had a couple of key players unavailable and had to scramble to put together a four-man bench, before they played 20 minutes of the game with 14 after two sinbinnings.</p>
<p>One yellow card was for a professional foul but, crucially, the team also lost their hooker and captain Gabriel Hakaraia after what proved to be mistaken identity.</p>
<p>Munro said the touch judge got the wrong player at a break down and it had actually been a Wairarapa-Bush player who made the infringement.</p>
<p>Hakaraia, who is well regarded for not tolerating foul play within his Ruapehu senior team, was shocked at the first yellow card of his career.</p>
<p>"[The official] apologised but had actually gone on and made it," said Munro.</p>
<p>The team made do, as Kaierau winger Stuart Brosnahan had moved into openside flanker for the match and had a good game.</p>
<p>Munro said powerful midfielder and former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Kameli Kuruyabaki</strong> was probably the difference between the two sides.</p>
<p>"If you had to name one, because they all stood up, he was bloody outstanding."</p>
<p>Wairarapa-Bush came back at Wanganui twice in the latter stages, but they held on to the crown they won as an Under-19 team in 2014, along with 2013 when the team was again the Wanganui U20s.</p>
<p>The Wanganui U18s had a grind against Taranaki Secondary Schools in Hawera, losing a tight match 8-0.</p>
<p>Wanganui's defence held out against an early onslaught, with the tight five putting in a big effort in and around the ruck.</p>
<p>Junior Ainea had a standout game putting in some hard tackles and turning over possession at the breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Kauika</strong> had another solid game at fullback and made good breaks out wide.</p>
<p>Taranaki got a penalty in front of the posts to lead 3-0 at halftime, and while Wanganui kept defending hard, Taranaki eventually got through as their winger went over in the corner.</p>
<p>Having given a lot to hold the home team out, Wanganui had few chances on attack and were shut down at each stage.</p>
<p>Coaches Cornel Mason and Daniel Tamehana have a good idea on their work-on's before their HYRC Cup campaign starts against Wellington at Cooks Gardens this Saturday.</p>
<p>The Wanganui U16s were desperately unlucky in their 22-19 loss to Manawatu U16s at Spriggens Park. The home team led for most of the game before giving up an unconverted try with time up on the clock.</p>
