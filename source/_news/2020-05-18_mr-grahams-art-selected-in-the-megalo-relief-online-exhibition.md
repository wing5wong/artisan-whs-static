##### Megalo Relief Online Exhibition  
12 May - 13 June 2020

THANK YOU to all artists who submitted applications for our first Online Exhibition. 

We received hundreds of entries and the exceptional standard of work submitted made it a tricky job for the panel to narrow it down to just 40. 

The exhibition is up online now and definitely worth a look: <https://www.megalo.org/relief-online-exhibition>
