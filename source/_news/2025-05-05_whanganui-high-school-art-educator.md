The Aotearoa NZ Association of Art Educators (ANZAAE) biannual conference was attended by our department, and 100s of arts educators from around Aotearoa. It was an inspiring, reflective and fun 3 day conference of key note speakers, talks and practical workshops, held in the almighty Waikato, at Wintec in Hamilton. 

Our very own Graham Hall, was acknowledged with a lifetime membership award for his tireless contributions to Visual Arts education. Congratulations Graham!!!
