Bible Friends is a Christian group for people with an intellectual disability. Every year at Christmas the group puts on a concert, which includes carol singing and a play. This event is put on for family, friends and anyone else that may be interested.  

This year the question is asked: 'What's behind the green door?' Is it a party? Is it Santa? Presents? The beach? A mysterious cleaner, who keeps popping up in unexpected places, has the answer, but 'The Seeker' must find out for herself. Come and see what she discovers!

This year the story of the play has been made into a booklet which is on sale at $5 a copy, as a fundraiser for disabled people in the Philippines. 

The Bible Friends concert will be held on Tuesday, 1st December at Christ Church Anglican, 243 Wicksteed St, at 7pm. Supper will follow - all welcome.
