📣 Exciting international exchange coming to Whanganui! 🌏🏉

Last week, Toshi Konishi from ARC Nexsis, and Kenji Motooka from Nexsis Japan Ltd, visited Whanganui to discuss an exciting upcoming visit from Otemon Gakuin High School in February 2026! ✨

A squad of 15 talented girls will be travelling from Osaka Japan, to take part in a mini rugby sevens tournament, proudly facilitated by Whanganui Rugby  🏉🔥

We’re proud to be co-hosting these students alongside Whanganui Girls' College, and we can’t wait to welcome them into our schools and wider community.

This visit is more than just sport — it’s about cultural exchange, building international friendships, and growing opportunities for our students and our region. It’s a unique chance for our rangatahi to connect through sport and learn from one another.

A massive thank you to Whanganui Rugby  for their incredible support in making this programme possible. 💙💚
