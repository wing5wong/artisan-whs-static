<p>TWO teams continue to dominate the top of the table in the Wanganui Premier One netball championship after the fourth round on Monday night.</p>
<p><span>Phillips Electrical Whanganui High School and&nbsp;</span>Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau are tied on 12 points and remain the only unbeaten sides in the eight-team competition.</p>
<p>Kaierau, however, has the edge on goal difference at this stage of the championship.</p>
<p>Kaierau looked a tad vulnerable at times against Mint Cafe Marist, but finally gained control late in the game to win comfortably, 48-27.</p>
<p>WHS had a tough close tussle with New World Taihape finally claiming the match 43-37.</p>
<p>The frustrating run of injuries and illness appeared over for Wanganui Athletic Sports when they impressed, winning every quarter to beat Mere Te Aroha 57-34.</p>
<p>WA Sports coach Trish Anstis has struggled to regularly field her best combinations so far, but the potential was finally realised on Monday.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm so proud of the girls, they stuck to the game plan just about the whole game. As a coach to win all four quarters is a hard ask and I don't think my team has managed this for quite some time, so I'm pretty happy," Anstis said.</p>
<p>"We started the game a bit shaky, but once they settled into the game they grew with confidence.</p>
<p>"It was a total team effort with captain Hayley Addenbrooke and Diana Williams-Cribb feeding the shooters Victoria Anstis and Stevie Rowan with precision passing and both shooters finished off well.</p>
<p>"Cheyanne McDougall was outstanding, picking up numerous intercepts and between Julie Rowan, Lucy Stewart and Cheyanne they created turnover after turnover, which was converted at the other end."</p>
<p>WA Sports won the first quarter 13-7, the second 27-16, the third 41-29 to produce the 57-34 victory. They now sit third on the table with eight points ahead of Kaiwhaiki in fourth on seven, Marist six, MTA four, Taihape three and Cullinane two.</p>
<p>Spectator-wise the Cullinane clash with Taihape was perhaps the game of the night. The match ended in a 47-all draw after Taihape led through the first three quarters. Taihape started well, claiming the first quarter 11-9, widening the gap slightly to 24-19 at half time before Cullinane began a fight back in the third to sit just four points adrift (37-33).</p>
<p>The young, far less experienced Cullinane team showed real comeback quality to out-point their rivals in the final quarter and end the match with the 47-all draw.</p>
<p>Cullinane coach Te Ora Nyman said while she was again unable to field a full complement of her more senior players with some away on other school commitments, the young team showed true grit on the night.</p>
<p>"This team is a beautiful side, but still a work in progress. Last night they connected better and showed a bit more confidence in their combinations," Nyman said.</p>
<p>"Shannah Andrews (GS) and Ina Whanarere (GA) were key players I had back in the side after missing the last couple of weeks. They both had excellent games. We just need to work a bit harder on our defence, but I was really proud of the girls last night."</p>
<p>The match-up of the night next Monday will be the top of the table clash between Kaierau and WHS.</p>
