<p>The Wanganui Under 17 team still smiling in Canterbury yesterday.</p>
<p>It has been a tournament as emotionally gruelling as it was physical, but the Wanganui Under 17 team finished unbowed at the Age Group Netball Championships in Rangiora yesterday.</p>
<p>While the normally unsatisfying 23rd placing mirrors last year, the team had to rise above a crippling illness and injury toll, plus the emotional distress of the death of the uncle of player <strong>Kerwyn Morgan</strong> at the start of the week.</p>
<p>Morgan flew home yesterday as Wanganui went on with barely seven serviceable players after the goal keep Catherine Nauga had a suspected broken leg, with <strong>Britney Rourangi</strong> flying in to join the side.</p>
<p>Croaky coach Parekura Muraahi, who by yesterday had caught the dreaded lurgi which laid four squad members flat in Canterbury, watched them narrowly lose their morning playoff with Nelson 37-30, with only six players available.</p>
<p>They were back to seven as vice-captain Lisa Lin dragged herself out of bed for the last game just two hours later with Whangarei to decide 23rd-24th.</p>
<p>After a double extra time period of five minutes each way, the scores were still tied before an exhausted Wanganui prevailed 50-48 in sudden death - where a team had to get a two goal lead.</p>
<p>"They functioned beautifully. It was a really tough match, ended up playing an extra 17 minutes," said Muraahi.</p>
<p>"When we were drawn at fulltime, I turned to my manager and said 'given the week we've had, of course we go to overtime'."</p>
<p><strong>Just like last year, the decimation of the squad meant captain Niamh Flower played every minute of every game, joined this time by fellow troopers Francie Walford and Kahurangi Sturmey.</strong></p>
<p>"I take my hat off to them. They carried the load," said Muraahi.</p>
<p>The idea of entering these tournaments is to develop players for the future, and Muraahi said the squad had found inner resources they never knew they had.</p>
<p>"It was a great experiance to go into extra time and then extra-extra time.</p>
<p>"They thought they were spent, but to then play on just adds to the experiance."</p>
