<p>Whanganui student Emma Carroll was spending a few days in her home city before she jets off to a student exchange at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old is a recipient of the Prime Minister's Scholarship for Asia (PMSA) and is one of 156 Kiwi students selected to study, carry out internships or conduct research at top institutions throughout Asia.</p>
<p>The selections were announced by tertiary education, skills and employment Minister Paul Goldsmith last week.</p>
<p>"I have known for a few weeks but I was only allowed to tell my immediate family before the announcement," says Emma.</p>
<p>"It has been really hard not telling my friends about it."</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student is studying towards a bachelor of science (technology) at the University of Waikato.</p>
<p>Emma says she has not been to Asia before and finds the prospect "very exciting."</p>
<p>She leaves for Singapore on January 4 and has been doing a bit of local travel to catch up with family and friends before her departure.</p>
<p>"I plan to travel in Asia as well as complete the internship and I will be away for about six months," she says.</p>
<p>At the awards announcement last week, Mr Goldsmith said the PMSA is designed to encourage New Zealand students to study in Asian countries and experience the benefits of international education for themselves.<span style="color: #222222; font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"Since the establishment of the PMSA programme in 2013, 907 New Zealand students have been awarded a scholarship to study in a variety of Asian countries," he said.</p>
<p>Students will study in 11 countries, with China, India and Japan the top three destinations this round.</p>
<p>Funding for the PMSA of $9 million over five years was initially provided in the government's 2013 Budget as part of the government's internationally focused growth package.</p>
<p>Additional funding of $2.5 million was granted in Budget 2016 to cover the awards for the next two years.</p>
<p>The total awarded this round was $1,401,657.</p>
<p>Of the successful recipients, 69 students will take part in a variety of programmes ranging from a long term Chinese language programme at Beijing Language and Culture University, a one-year exchange to Kwansei Gakuin University in Japan, and an Internship at the United Nations assistance to the Khmer Rouge trials in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Applications for round two of the 2017 PSMA opened mid-December 2016, and close 30 March 2017.</p>
