<p class="element element-paragraph">Two Whanganui teens have received a financial boost towards achieving their dreams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Shea Robinson and Thor Wrigglesworth are the inaugural recipients of the Rotary Club of Wanganui North's youth sponsorship awards which provide cash grants of up to $500.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sponsorship co-ordinator Evert van Reenan said the funds came from the proceeds of the club's 2018 Christmas trailer raffle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The sponsorship programme aims to financially support youth in activities that develop character, leadership and confidence in sporting, cultural or recreational endeavours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Thor's grant will help him attend the Mind Body and Soul course at Outward Bound and Shea's funding will support his passion for motor racing where he volunteers for a New Zealand championship contending team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The committee was very impressed with the applications," van Reenan said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Both the young men's applications ticked all the boxes and we were impressed with their enthusiasm, drive and vision.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We look forward to more applications now the school year is under way."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Individuals who are aged between 13 and 19 and currently live within the Whanganui District boundaries can apply for sponsorship. The club is interested in receiving applications that may not qualify for other funding and sponsorship.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For more information about the fund or to get an application form, contact Evert van Reenan on 021 024 071 69.</p>
