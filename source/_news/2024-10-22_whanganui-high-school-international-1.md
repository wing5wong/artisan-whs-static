🌟 Exciting Collaboration Alert! 🌟

Director of International Students, Natasha McKee, along with Rach Hoskin from Whanganui & Partners and Tomomi Kontani from Education New Zealand had a productive meeting with the Tokyo Board of Education today,  discussing future short-term group visits to Whanganui. This gave us the oppotunity to highlight Whanganui's  strengths in agriculture, business, and the arts.

Looking forward to fostering these international connections and showcasing the best of what Whanganui has to offer! 🌏✨
