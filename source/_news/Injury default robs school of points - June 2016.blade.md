<p><span>INJURY-PLAGUED: The Whanganui High School First XV defaulted the Friday night game against Massey White because injuries have hit the colts side.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>AN INJURY-plagued Whanganui High School First XV has slipped down the points table after defaulting to defending champions Massey White in last Friday's Manawatu McDonalds Colts division clash.</p>
<p>Both sides were unbeaten until WHS pulled the pin to allow several key players time to mend.</p>
<p>With Massey White gaining maximum points for the default WHS has slipped to second on the table ahead of the Wanganui Metro Colts who had the bye at the weekend.</p>
<p>WHS First XV manager Richard Bennett said it was decided to default against such a tough side so players could recover for the remainder of the competition, including the local derby with Metro on home soil in a fortnight.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">.</span></p>
<p>"We play Massey Ag next week and then we're set to play Metro at High School the week after and that will be an exciting game when brothers Griffen and Riley Culver are likely to mark each other.</p>
<p>Griffen is our halfback and has quite a serious ankle injury, so he will probably also miss the Massey Ag match and hopefully return for the Metro game to mark his older brother who has been playing halfback for Metro. Our next three Manawatu Colts division games are at home and we also have an inter-school match against Hutt Valley coming up."</p>
<p>WHS played its first inter-school game against Hawera High School last week winning 59-17.</p>
<p>"For once it wasn't raining but the ground was still heavy underfoot," Bennett said.</p>
<p>"The opposition forward pack was strong, particularly the front row and they had a useful backline, especially their inside backs. In the end, after playing bigger and harder teams week in and week out, we were far too strong. We always pride ourselves on playing attractive 15-man running rugby which showed on the scoreboard with contributions across the board.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"Our loose trio of Brayden Maua, Tom Healy and inspirational captain Dylan Bowater (Player of the Day) out-played their opposition. Our vice-captain Mitchell Millar lead the team around the park with good vision and a strong boot. Our midfield backs, Sheldon Pakenga-Manahira and Ayzak Bennett, together with fullback Adam Boult, who is a man to watch for the future, were far to classy and could not be contained scoring the bulk of our tries.</p>
<p>"We have a young forward pack, which is improving with every week."</p>
<p>Final Score :</p>
<p>WHS 59 - 17 Hawera</p>
<p>(Scoreboard: S Pakenga-Manahira 3, A Bennett 1, M Millar 1, A Boult 1, K Coveney 1, D Mariner, T Healy 1 tries and M Millar 7 conversions).</p>
