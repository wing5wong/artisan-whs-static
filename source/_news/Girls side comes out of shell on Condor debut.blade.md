<p>It was welcome to the big time for the wide-eyed Whanganui High School open girls team who entered their first Condor Sevens tournament in Auckland at the weekend.</p>
<p>This was the first time any Whanganui school has sent a girls team to the biggest national sevens event in the country, with 96 teams in the open and under 15 grades competing at Sacred Heart College.</p>
<p>On Saturday, WHS had a very tough ask first up against contenders Hamilton Girls' High School, being beaten 36-5, before taking on Southern Cross Campus for a 27-7 loss.</p>
<p>However, there was some encouraging signs in the 28-15 defeat to Cambridge High School in the final match of the day.</p>
<p>"They were a little bit in their shells, it took them half a game to get into the first game," said coach and Whanganui rugby stalwart Denning Tyrell.</p>
<p>"Execution level - it was good for their standard, but the tournament standard, it needed a bit more time and preparation."</p>
<p>Kahurangi Sturmey scored tries in the first and third games, while Montel Aki got the converted try in the second match and and Kerwyn Morgan and Iriaka Mason also got on the sheet against Cambridge.</p>
<p>Finding their feet in the lower tier playoffs, WHS then picked up a win over Mt Roskill Grammar School by 31-12 to make the consolation shield final with Gisborne Girls High School.</p>
<p>The match was broadcast on Sky TV, but unfortunately WHS couldn't bring home some silverware in their Condor debut, losing 38-5.</p>
<p>Tyrell said he would be more than happy to take the school side back to Condor next year, although given the exposure they have brought to the game a couple of other local schools could put up a challenge in the qualification stages.</p>
<p>"It was a good experience, that was the main thing. They played really well.</p>
<p>"They put their hand up with the amount of time given to take part and prepare themselves."</p>
