<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">For the second time in two years, the Wanganui High School mixed touch team came within a whisker of claiming the New Zealand Secondary Schools title at Papakura's Bruce Pulman at the weekend.</span></p>
<p>WHS made last year's mixed-grade final against all expectations and lost 8-7 to Alfriston College, the winning try coming inside the final minute.</p>
<p>Wanting just one game better in 2014, WHS coach and former New Zealand touch captain Sean Brown was gutted when the team were narrowly beaten by another Auckland team in the Cup final, losing 4-3 to Mount Albert Grammar.</p>
<p>"I was very disappointed that we were unable to make the final step, however I'm very proud of the effort that was put in to get to the final again," he said.</p>
<p>In the 20-team mixed grade, only the top three from the Central Region tournament won automatic entry to the nationals.</p>
<p>Cullinane College also made the nationals after finishing runnerup to WHS at Central.</p>
<p>"Its exciting to see the talent we have here in Wanganui," said Brown.</p>
<p>Cullinane would ultimately finish eighth overall, beaten by Massey High School 5-3 and Te Awamutu College 6-4 in their playoff games.</p>
<p>WHS started Day 1 with wins over Massey (6-4), St Andrews College (7-2) and Kaikorai Valley College (8-2).</p>
<p>They met Mt Albert on Day 2 and stumbled 5-4, before beating townmates Cullinane 6-4 and then avenging their 2013 final defeat to Alfriston, 7-4.</p>
<p>An 8-2 win followed over Rutherford College, before beating Macleans College 5-4 in the Cup semifinals.</p>
<p>Team members Blair Osborne, Kalib Houltham, Ruhia Tamati and Taniko Tamehana made the mixed-grade tournament team.</p>
<p>Osborne and Tamati were recognised as the boy's and girl's MVPs of the entire grade.</p>
<p>"This was absolutely amazing to have two players recognised Most Valuable of the tournament, plus to be both Year 11," said Brown. "Shows the potential for the next few years."</p>
