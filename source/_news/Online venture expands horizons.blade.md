<p>THE DREAM: Former WHS student Matt Aplin aims to go travelling full-time while running an online business.</p>
<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Two weeks ago Matt Aplin took an unexpected life turn.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The former Whanganui High School student quit his day job to start an online business that, if all goes to plan, he could run anywhere in the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 26-year-old said the move was a risk but one he was willing to have a crack at.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had been in my job for two years after graduating and I just wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The job wasn't what I wanted to pursue long term and I had a strong desire to travel."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After graduating from the University of Canterbury with a Bachelor of Commerce in finance, strategy and entrepreneurship, Mr Aplin started working as a management cadet for Metalcraft Engineering.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Working as an understudy to the chief executive, he took on small projects within the company that needed improvement, such as inventory control and updating the website.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now, he spends most of his days at home or at the New Brighton library working hard to make his dream a reality.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The go-getter said he was targeting small businesses looking to create a "simple and beautiful" online presence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The work will involve creating websites, updating and maintaining the business' online marketing, optimising their search engine, social media and basically completing all the fun online work," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Aplin said he has already picked up four clients "the old-fashioned way" through word of mouth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The dream is I'll spend the next couple of months building up some clients and hopefully accumulate enough work that I can base myself anywhere in the world."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His desire to travel stems from a hunger to know more about the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Travel is learning and bettering yourself. It humbles your own and exposes you to different world views.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think we can build our own lives into whatever we want them to be. It's not an easy process but I'm determined so I believe I can earn an income while travelling."</p>
