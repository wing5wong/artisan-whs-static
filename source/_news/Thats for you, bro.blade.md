<h4><br />The brother of Felix Newton, who died in a car accident on Christmas Day 2018, has won a surfing trophy named in his honour.</h4>
<h4>Seb Newton was named the inaugural winner of the Felix Newton Trophy for riding the best wave at the Cold Water Classic on Sunday.</h4>
<p><br />Senior members of the Wanganui Board Riders, who created the event, judged Newton the winner.</p>
<p>Wanganui Board Riders president Matt Edmonds said it was a really great result.</p>
<p>"Seb's one of our up-and-comers. He's rapidly becoming one of our better surfers in town and he's only a pup," Edmonds said.</p>
<p>"For Seb to win it with an incredible ride was outstanding."</p>
<p>The family of Felix Newton approached the board riders asking if they could donate a competition trophy in their son's honour as he was an avid surfer.</p>
<p>Edmonds said that the Cold Water Classic was the perfect fit for it.</p>
<p>"There tends to be more of a whanau approach to the day, where the board riders and their extended family meet down at the beach," he said.</p>
<p>"It's a day not only celebrating the board riders, but Felix and those that have gone before him."</p>
<p>Edmonds remembers Felix surfing from a young age.</p>
<p>He said he was a beautiful guy with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p>"His father's a surfer, so he was encouraged towards the water, but from an early age he thrived in the water.&nbsp; The ocean's not for everybody, but he was into the ocean like a little seal pup. He was very dedicated to chasing waves."</p>
<p>Twenty-seven board riders took to the river, which was surfable thanks to some big swells at 8am on Sunday and then moved on to the North Mole on Morgan St.</p>
<p>Poor weather on Saturday meant that the event was pushed back to Sunday, coincidentally the day that would have been Felix's 18th birthday.</p>
<p>Edmonds said the conditions ended up being perfect.</p>
<p>"They couldn't have been better really after the mess of the weather towards the end of last week.&nbsp; The snow melt meant that the water was very fresh and we had challenging conditions, but they were great for riding.&nbsp; It was a bloody great day."</p>
