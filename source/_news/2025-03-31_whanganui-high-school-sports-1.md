Well done to our Volleyball girls at Nationals.

Day 5: for the final game we played Wellington High School who we had previously played and narrowly lost too. The team played extremely well, winning the first set and narrowly losing the second set 25-23 after a strong comeback. The team unfortunately lost, 2 sets to 1 after a tough game. Congratulations to the girls and all their efforts at nationals and a big thank you and all the best to our year 13s, Jeide and Delaney.
