<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Three Whanganui High School students were the big winners at UCOL's U-Skills Academy Award Evening.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Eden Ruissen won the award for outstanding student, Jamie Campbell received a dedication award and Ulani Hall picked up the prize for improvement.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ruissen and Campbell studied hair and beauty while Hall changed gears studying automotive.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Communications adviser for UCOL Jeremy Bryson said Wednesday's event held at the Central Baptist Church on Wicksteed St went really well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had 42 students attend the ceremony and about 70 students did U-Skills programmes in Whanganui in total," Bryson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's expected that a few don't make it to the prizegiving because of work commitments and such."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">U-Skills gives secondary school students the option of learning through UCOL for one day per week and focuses on giving them industry-relevant skills as well as NCEA credits.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Manager of 100% Sweet Whanganui, Jason Shailer, was a guest speaker at the event, as was second year bachelor of nursing student Ashleigh Kauika.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She had a really great story about how she wasn't too focused on her education and where she wanted to go on terms of a career until she started in U-Skills," Bryson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"U-Skills put her on a path to becoming a nurse and helped her find her passion for helping people."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The following day on Thursday at the Whanganui UCOL Campus on Rutland St, a scholarship ceremony was held.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Akoranga Education Trust scholarship recipients are Arama Tuka, Eva Harkness, Natalia Paki, Opal Downes, Mia Campbell, Kristine Lott, Teresa Wakefield and Angela (Poppy) Rowe.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Arthur Wheeler Leedstown Trust scholarship recipients are Alexandria Morder and Leah Akkerman.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">George Boulton Trust scholarship recipients are Roimata Hooper and (former WHS student)&nbsp;<strong>Nicholas Toyne.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Grand Hotel scholarship recipient is Anita Sutherland-Herbison.</p>
