<p><strong>WINNER: WHS student Jimi Blinkhorne won an Australian under 17 roller hockey title with Melbourne club Mordialloc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mangamahu teenager Jimi Blinkhorne returned the country yesterday with an Australian roller hockey gold medal around his neck.</strong></p>
<p>The New Zealand age-group representative spent last week playing for the Melbourne-based Mordialloc club's under-17 side in the Australia Day Cup national roller hockey tournament.</p>
<p>The tournament was held in Melbourne from January 18-22 and featured the best clubs from around Australia.</p>
<p>Blinkhorne impressed the hosts scoring seven goals in the under-17 tournament culminating in scoring a hat trick in Mordialloc's 5-1 win over Brisbane club Stafford in the final.</p>
<p>While there the 15-year-old also took the chance to play in the senior competition turning out for New Plymouth which sent a team over the ditch.</p>
<p>It was his first taste of senior competition and a big step up in quality given some teams had Australian senior representatives.</p>
<p>Still, Blinkhorne managed to score three goals in the senior side's six games.</p>
<p>He said he felt comfortable in the under-17 competition and his performances earned praise from Mordialloc's club captain who called him an asset to the team.</p>
<p>The trip to Australia was a chance for him to develop his game and gain experience in what is a quiet period for roller hockey in New Zealand.</p>
<p>He said the Australian style of play was a lot more focussed on technique and skill whereas New Zealand roller hockey often required power and strength.</p>
<p>Part of the national title-winning Wanganui youth team last year and also a Whanganui High School field hockey player, Blinkhorne said he had enjoyed his Australian experience and planned to return for next year's title defence.</p>
<p>But before that his father Paul is hoping to get him to Barcelona in June for a training camp and hopes to seek out sponsors.</p>
<p>"To get taught by the best you've pretty much go to go there," Paul Blinkhorne said. "He's good enough to go a lot further."</p>
