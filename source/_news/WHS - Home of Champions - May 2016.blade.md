<p>"I'm thrilled to see Amaan from Wanganui High School, and now an Auckland University student, receive calculus, Earth and space science and music scholarships as well as outstanding scholarships for chemistry, economics, physics and statistics. It was really great to see the award made at Parliament, with Amaan's mum and dad present, along with the other premier scholars from around New Zealand."</p>
