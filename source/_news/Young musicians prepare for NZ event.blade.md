<p class="element element-paragraph">More than 90 young musicians from the Whanganui region are tuning up to compete in the annual New Zealand Community Trust Chamber Music Contest.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui District contest takes place on Friday, June 9 at the Prince Edward Auditorium, Wanganui Collegiate School, and is one of 15 district contests nationwide. It will be adjudicated by bassoonist and composer Ben Hoadley.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ben is lecturer at the University of Auckland, where he has taught bassoon and chamber music since 2007. He is principal bassoonist with the Sydney Omega Ensemble and has worked with orchestras around the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ben holds degrees in bassoon performance from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the New England Conservatory (Boston) and a Master of Music with first-class honours in composition from the University of Waikato.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year the Whanganui contest has attracted 29 ensembles involving 94 musicians with six groups travelling from Marton. The groups range from standard chamber music ensembles with violin or flute, cello and piano, to groups with singers, six hands on one piano, guitar trio and percussion groups, all playing a variety of styles of music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealand Community Trust Chamber Music Contest is the longest running youth music competition in New Zealand and in 2015 celebrated its 50th jubilee. It is the only nationwide chamber music competition for young musicians and composers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This contest is well-known for nurturing young musicians who go on to successful musical careers in NZ and abroad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as organising the contest, Chamber Music NZ also arranges coaching and open workshops for ensembles with the support of ABRSM. This year, Whanganui was lucky enough to be awarded some coaching sessions with Doug Beilman, former violinist in the NZ String Quartet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The students thoroughly enjoyed their sessions with Doug, learning more about bringing the music to life through characterisation and communication.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>This year 17 composition entries have been submitted in the original composition section of the contest, including one entry from Wanganui High School student Ben Power.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ben's Prelude &amp; Fugue in D Lydian for Piano, Violin and will also be performed at the Whanganui District Contest rounds by trio The Classical Modes Take Two with Ben on piano.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wellington-based composer, and lecturer in composition at Victoria University, Michael Norris, will select two winning scores (junior and senior) and the winning composers will be announced in June.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winners will be awarded SOUNZ cash prizes and a year's subscription to CANZ (Composers' Association of New Zealand).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following the Whanganui District round, the top ensembles from Hawke's Bay, East Coast, Whanganui, Manawatu and Wellington contests will travel to Napier to compete in the central regional finals to be held on Saturday, June 24.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The top 12 ensembles from the three regional finals held in Christchurch, Napier and Auckland will compete in the national finals on Friday and Saturday, August 5 and 6. in Wellington.</p>
