Whanganui jazz star, Angela Crawford, has been promoting jazz and live music in our town for many, many years. Her latest project is to cultivate an audience for cool jazz on Saturday afternoons this summer in the pleasant surroundings of the newly revamped Lucky Bar.

You may have heard her trio at Virginia Lake on Sundays. Well, she is back with a quartet that includes vocalist, Ash Mayor, **young drummer, Chester Nevil** (WHS student) and all round muso, Dave Griffiths on bass. 

Those who know Angela know exactly what to expect – a vast repertoire of recognised great tunes played sensitively. The musicians pay attention to each other and thoroughly enjoy each others company. You feel that instantly.

It’s all kicking off this coming weekend.  Starting at midday, these ‘Uptown Hipsters’ are putting on a lunchtime session of Swing, Latin & Blues. The band will play until mid-afternoon, so will cover both lunch and afternoon teas.  Get a group of mates together and come on down and enjoy the music and the hospitality in the comfort that Andrew Rennie, Lucky Bar’s owner, has made his priority. The bar/restaurant features a great stage indoors and charmed outdoor seating under the permanent canopy.

So c’mon down, enjoy the fare and the ambience of Lucky Bar (53 Wilson St), kick back and listen to some cool jazz this coming Saturday, 7 November.
