<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Two Whanganui students have taken out the supreme award at a cooking competition, beating out teams from throughout New Zealand.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Charlotte Taylor and Matt Hirini, both students at Whanganui High School, won the gold medal at the National Secondary Schools' Culinary Competition in Auckland on August 29.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Charlotte also won a financial scholarship to study culinary arts at tertiary level.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There were eight teams in total at the competition, all of whom had won a regional final. They were given a brief: a starter that had to include pumpkin, and a main that had to include chicken, potatoes and seasonal vegetables.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Charlotte and Matt impressed with their entree, Summertime Squash, and their main, Chicken-and-a-Basket. They had to produce four of each dish - eight dishes in total - in just 90 minutes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Last year we won the bronze medal, so there's been a huge improvement since then," Charlotte said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Charlotte and Matt also recently won silver at the Beef and Lamb competition in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both students are Year 13, which means they will be leaving school at the end of the year. Charlotte intends to take up her scholarship so she can become a chef; while Matt said it was one of a number of options he's considering.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're also thinking about who we can help train up before we leave, so there's a team for next year," Matt said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They paid tribute to their teacher, Linda Hardcastle, and their mentor, Dean Wong, both of whom have spent many hours working with the pair.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Hardcastle said she was delighted by her students' win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm very, very proud of them. They faced intense competition but did extremely well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Charlotte and Matt also wanted to acknowledge Wanganui Produce, which supplied some of the food free of charge.</p>
