<p><span>The Sport Whanganui review of college sport in the region continues with a look at a busy week for Wanganui High School.</span></p>
<p>A UNIQUE 10-year-old relationship was again celebrated last week when the Wanganui High School junior ranks hosted an Australian College.</p>
<p>Wanganui Park Secondary College from Shepparton, Melbourne, were on a North Island tour last week and stayed in Wanganui for two nights to take part in a sporting exchange with Wanganui High School. The two schools alternate hosting duties each year.</p>
<p>"This is an exchange we have done for a few years now - five for us, I think - and it is always a pleasure to have the students come out and be billeted by our families," WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said.</p>
<p>"We have also travelled over to their school and played them and other schools in their region, it's a great experience for our students."</p>
<p>The Victorian school proved too strong for the WHS junior A1 netball girls, winning two of the three encounters, while making a clean sweep on the tennis courts.</p>
<p>It was a busy week for WHS with the exchange and then also hosting the Central 6 Competition on Friday.</p>
<p>On Friday WHS hosted the Summer Sports Central 6 competition at various venues in Wanganui. Schools competing in this competition were WHS, Tawa College, Taradale High School, Havelock North High School and Kapiti College.</p>
<p>Students from these schools participated in numerous sports including cricket, touch, tennis, volleyball and athletics. Freyberg High School usually attend but could not this year so Wanganui City College and travelled College were invited to compete which was much appreciated and they all seemed to enjoy the day. Murphy gave a big thank you to all WHS staff and the volunteer coaches who helped out on the day.</p>
