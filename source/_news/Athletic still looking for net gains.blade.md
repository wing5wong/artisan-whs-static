<p><br />Amid head-shaking frustration, GJ Gardner Wanganui Athletic coach Jason King summed his side's current predicament best.</p>
<p>It really doesn't matter how well you play if the ball is not going in the net.</p>
<p>A strong case can be made for Athletic having had the better of Napier Marist at Wembley Park on Saturday &ndash; they certainly created more and better chances &ndash; but it was a first-half injury time goal to Luis Toomey which gave the Hawke's Bay side a narrow 1-0 win in their Lotto Federation League match.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">Goals have been the one ingredient missing from Athletic's match day</span>&nbsp;<span class="QhgiTxHt0g">recipe as of late, and again they just couldn't conjure up enough to salvage one competition point despite deserving to do so.</span></p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"We still just couldn't do enough to find the back of the net," King said.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"We've got to find an answer for that. Short and simple."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Athletic have now gone two league games without a goal, having not scored in league play since April's 3-2 win over Massey University &ndash; a game in which they netted more than half their current season tally.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Meanwhile, Napier Marist arrived at Wembley Park tied at the summit of the ladder, having only lost once.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">And while they racked up set piece opportunities early on, they never caused concern for a solid Athletic defence.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">It was a tussle in the opening quarter, with the first real chance not coming until the 26th minute when Athletic's Jude Hiri put a header over the bar after Jake Simcox put in a pinpoint cross from outside the box.</p>

<p class="QhgiTxHt0g"><br />Napier's Luis Toomey soon had a clear sight at goal, but got no power behind the ball as it fell into Athletic keeper Matthew Calvert's hands.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Athletic were just starting to get on top of the visitors as the half wound down, with Scott Burney and James Satherley both getting good chances to give their side a lead.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Mind annoyance then turned to complete frustration when it was the visitors who scored what would be the winner seconds before the break.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Calvert had brilliantly saved two shots from Napier &ndash; first poaching the ball in a one-on-one with a Napier attacker, and then charging down the follow-up strike.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">But then Toomey took a third swing off the rebound with the ball flying into the empty goal.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"I don't think they deserved that goal to be honest," King said post-match.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"Great saves and then the guy on the line couldn't get across to kick it out.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"If anything, a draw would've been a better reflection but we had plenty of chances - again."</p>

<p class="QhgiTxHt0g"><br />If chances won matches Athletic would have turned things around with ease because there was more than a handful in the second spell.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Napier did come close to earning a buffer in the 80th minute when a Harry Mason shot stuck the post, before closing out the game to claim three more points.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"That's what the score sheet says," King said.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"You can talk about how well we played but at the end of the day we need the marks on the ref's card and we still can't do that yet.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"They were a decent side. Perhaps I was expecting a little bit more from them but at the end of the day they got three points - again."</p>

<p class="QhgiTxHt0g"><br />Athletic's general play has been improving all season, they're now back to full strength but are still lacking that final shot.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"We get ourselves into good positions, we break down teams and for a lot of the game they didn't really look like they were going to score against us, let's be fair," King said.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"It was great to be able to have all the players there at our disposal and we did play relatively well, they didn't really push is too much.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">"So I feel a bit ripped of to be honest. We've still not quite got that goal scorer that we probably need."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">Athletic return to Federation Cup action next weekend when they host Hokowhitu on Monday, before travelling to Palmerston North to play them again in the league the following Saturday.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">In other matches North End beat Palmerston North Marist 4-3, Red Sox Manawatu defeated New Plymouth Rangers 4-1, Havelock North Wanderers thumped Massey University 10-0 while Palmerston North Boys High School had a 2-2 draw with Hokowhitu.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHt0g">In the Horizions Premiership, the GJ Gardner Homes Wanganui Athletic Reserves were afflicted with the same virus as their 1sts, being unable to find the back of the net in a 2-0 loss to Hokowhitu FC Reserves in the early afternoon game at Wembley.</p>
