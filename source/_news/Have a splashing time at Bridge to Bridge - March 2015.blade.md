<p>MORNING RIVER SWIM: Wanganui High School student Stefan Hannan on the way to winning the Bridge to Bridge 3km swim in February, 2014.</p>
<p>Young and old can go from either bridge to bridge or bank to bank in the Whanganui River tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Whanganui Multisport Club is hold its annual Bridge to Bridge Open Water Swim, which involves teams and individuals entering 1km and 3km races.</p>
<p>The long course will start at the Aramoho Rowing Club pontoon at 10.30am, passing under the train bridge and Dublin St Bridge, before finishing beside the Union Boat Club on Taupo Quay.</p>
<p>The 1km course begins near the Dublin St Bridge, just off Pitt St, and also finishes at Union.</p>
<p>Last year there was a strong overall field of 74 entrants, including 34 men and 19 women taking part in the long course version.</p>
<p>Before the main racing, the club will host a Ramp 2 Ramp challenge at the clubrooms on Anzac Parade.<img style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #e2e2e2;" src="http://data.apn.co.nz/apnnz/count/act=3/FCID=66005/SITE=NZH/AREA=REG.WANGANUICHRONICLE.SPORT.STY/CHA=SPORT/SS=SPORT/S1=NONE/S2=NONE/S3=NONE/S4=NONE/S5=NONE/HB=SPORT.HOME.SPORT.SPORT.SPORT/SCW=1920/SCH=1080/WLOC=none/WH=22/WL=16/WC=wind/VT=NONE/VV=NONE/VP=NONE/SEGMENT=light//UT=0/size=RECTANGLE/SA=2/SR=0/POS=2/VA=NO/random=6071598406/viewid=87444408304/KEYWORD=splashing+bridge+young+old+bank+whanganui+river+tomorrow+morning+multisport+club+hold+annual+open+water+swim+involves+teams+individuals+entering+km+races+long+course+start+aramoho+rowing+pontoon+am+passing+train" alt="" /><img style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #e2e2e2;" src="http://data.apn.co.nz/apnnz/count/actname=AdStart/fcid=66005" alt="" /><img style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: #e2e2e2;" src="http://bs.serving-sys.com/BurstingPipe/adServer.bs?cn=tf&amp;c=19&amp;mc=imp&amp;pli=12312986&amp;PluID=0&amp;ord=6071598406" alt="" /></p>
<p>For a gold coin donation, children or adults wanting to have their first go at river racing can swim a 75-metre course across the width of the river.</p>
<p>Flotation devices are permitted, and everyone will get a certificate and a treat. It starts at 9am.</p>
<p>As well as the traditional trophies for the river race winners, club members Adam and Melina Holmes have donated a trophy for anyone who does the race in a wetsuit, as they are usually precluded from winning the main prizes.</p>
<p>Registration opens at 9am tomorrow and closes an hour later.</p>
