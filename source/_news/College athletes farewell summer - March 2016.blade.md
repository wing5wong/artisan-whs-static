<p>WANGANUI High School had its first cricket interschool on Friday , February 26 at Victoria Park against Wairarapa College.</p>
<p>WHS first XI girls won their game with an outstanding batting performance from Wanganui rep and CD Hinds player Jessica Watkin getting 167 runs not out. Mikal Terrey also helped with 10 runs before going out.</p>
<p>Wairarapa batted first making 225/3 after 30 overs, but with Jessica on form WHS managed to win the game after 25 overs with 226/2.</p>
<p>WHS Junior Boys Colts team had a hard game with Wairarapa making 176/7 after 30 overs. WHS then struggled when they went into bat only making 56 all out. With a few more games and training, the school looks forward to seeing development in these junior boys.</p>
<p>The WHS first XI boys team started well in the field getting three wickets in the early stage. Timothy Roebuck 4-27, Joseph Redpath 2-39 and Quinn Mailman 2-34. Wairarapa finished with 190 before going out. WHS went in chasing 190, but only managed to get 100 runs on the board before being bowled out.</p>
<p>Our opening batters of Cameron MacKintosh and Joseph Redpath started well with 55 without loss. Cole Brasting supported with 21 before getting out. WHS was outplayed by Wairarapa leg spin bowler H. Wakling getting 8-21.</p>
<p>WHS are very lucky to have the expertise of a well-known cricketer Eric Head who is coaching our 1st XI team this season.</p>
<p>There is a pathway in place for cricket players at WHS and with Eric's knowledge, WHS are hoping to develop cricket again.</p>
