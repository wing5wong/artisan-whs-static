Itâ€™s been a busy seven days of judo for Lucas Munn! First the Auckland International coming away with Gold and Silver, whoop, whoop! Then a short hop, skip and long jump to Hong Kong for the International Judo Federation Asian Cadets Cup, coming away with a Bronze defeating the reigning 2024 champ and world ranked 11th player from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Way to go Lucas! Lucas is now in his training camp and onto Macau to compete again next weekend.  Good Luck Lucas!!!!!
