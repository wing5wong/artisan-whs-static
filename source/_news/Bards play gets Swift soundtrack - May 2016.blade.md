<p><strong>MISCHIEF: Emelye Brown as Helena is torn between suitors played by Konrad Shaw and Taonga Whanarere Potaka-Osbourne.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The stage in the Whanganui High School hall has been transformed into an Athenian forest for the opening night of a A Midsummer Night's Dream tonight.</strong></p>
<p>The Shakespearean comedy has been given a thoroughly modern accompaniment for the junior production.</p>
<p>"The band will play nine Taylor Swift songs," said drama teacher Colin Hedivan.</p>
<p>"Her songs fit very well with the themes in the play."</p>
<p>Ali Gammeter will play the mischievous Puck, Elyana Gifford is the fairy queen Titania, Abigail Martin will play the lovelorn Hermia and Emelye Brown will portray the conflicted Helena.</p>
<p>The Year 10 students say they love the themes of the play and think they are relevant to modern life.</p>
<p>"The storylines are so Year 10," says Emelye.</p>
<p>Students say the rehearsals have been "full-on" and they started in the first week of last term after auditioning for their roles last December.</p>
<p>"I already feel a bit sad that the rehearsals will be coming to an end soon," says Elyana.</p>
<p>"We have become really close like family."</p>
<p>Mr Hedivan has been teaching drama for 11 years and eight of them have been spent at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p>"I have wanted to do this play for years but I needed the right cast and now I've got them," he said.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With a cast of 38 and another 15 students working behind the scenes, Mr Hedivan said it has highlighted a wealth of talent and will give students NCEA credits as well. "There are also a number of senior students involved with non-acting roles and it has been great experience for them too.</p>
<p>"Now we just need to get it in front of an audience," he said.</p>
<p>The play, set in Athens, has four interconnecting plots full of comedy, magic and mayhem, and it is one Shakespeare play with happy endings for most of the characters.</p>
<p><strong>Tickets for the production are available from the WHS student centre at $15 for adults and $10 for students.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Performances are in the school hall and begin at 7.30pm on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights.</strong></p>
