**After a very successful year of debating, our Kowhai team has reached the finals of the John Prestage Junior Debating Competition.**

The girls won the semi-final against Collegiate School, in a limited preparation debate, during which the girls affirmed the moot: "This house will ban fossil fuels in the next ten years".

The team will now host the finals against Feilding High later this month.

We wish the team all the best.
