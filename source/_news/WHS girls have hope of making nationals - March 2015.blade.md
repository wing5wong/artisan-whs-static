<p>PIVOTAL PLAYER: &nbsp;Jess Watkin will play a major role in the fortunes of Wanganui High School against Palmerston North Girls High at Victoria Park this morning.</p>
<p>Wanganui High School are only two games away from possibly representing Central Districts at the National Secondary Schools Girls cricket when they shape up against Palmerston North Girls High at Victoria Park today.</p>
<p>WHS emerged as the Wanganui qualifier after the round-robin stages involving Nga Tawa, Wanganui Girls College and Cullinane, played every Wednesday.</p>
<p>WHS need to beat Palmerston North this morning to take on the winner of the Havelock North versus New Plymouth match this afternoon.</p>
<p>The winner will go on to the national finals in December. Last year WHS lost in the last over in the regional finals to eventual national winners Palmerston North Girls High.</p>
<p>Much will rest on the shoulders of young CD Hinds player Jess Watkin. Watkin is in fine form, scoring an unbeaten 169 against Cullinane as well as doing very well in the Secondary School Boys' tournament involving Ruapehu, WHS, City College and Cullinane. WHS won that and will represent Wanganui in the CD finals tomorrow in Palmerston North with Watkin again playing a pivotal role.</p>
<p>The girls semifinals begin at 11am this morning.</p>
