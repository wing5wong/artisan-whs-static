<p><span>BACK ON TOP: Kerwyn Morgan did her part to put defending champions WHS back on top of the points table against Kaiwhaiki on Monday night.</span></p>
<p>THERE could have been a door charge on Monday night's premier one netball and no-one would have felt short-changed with some fantastic skills and plucky determination on display.</p>
<p>The first round clash between the current second and third seeds EC Sports and Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau provided the battle of the night with plenty of nerves on display in the opening minutes.</p>
<p>The battle ended in a 45-all draw.</p>
<p>A new look defensive combination saw the return of Kaierau's manager, Mel Crothers to the court at goal keep, pairing up with utility player Rachael Lynch at goal defence. Te Reo Paki, normally seen in the defensive end, started at goal attack alongside goal shoot Suzanne Guilford who had to play a more mobile game to combat the strong and effective two on one defensive pressure applied by EC Sports defenders Alana Erceg and Terehia Gardiner.</p>
<p>She shot well under the circumstances, netting 37 from 41 goals to finish on 90 per cent but the volume of ball that she is accustomed to receiving was not there in the first half.</p>
<p>It came however in the third quarter when Lynch was moved back into centre, Amy Archer across to wing defence, Jackie Abraham on at goal attack and Paki back down to the defensive end. Kaierau snapped up ball and fed with precision into the circle to take the lead 39-32 at the three quarter break.</p>
<p>It was a night of sevens for coach Trish Anstis who despite trailing by seven going into the final quarter, was by no means down and out.</p>
<p>Unable to train with her full squad over the past seven days due to road access issues following the recent flood with herself on SH4, players Lucy Stewart (Mangamahu), Gerogia Coombes and Victoria Anstis (Palmerston North), she had every faith her starting seven - and the only seven players available for the game - could come back.</p>
<p>And come back they did restricting Kaierau to a mere seven attempts at goal in the final quarter.</p>
<p>Hayley Addenbrooke and Karaihi Peina combined beautifully through the court and played with precision on both attack and defence. They were well supported by wing defence Deshannon Matthews who had an outstanding game bringing the ball through court. EC Sports clawing their way back to finish with a thrilling draw 45-all.</p>
<p>"It was a total team effort, from all seven girls to peg back a seven goal deficit in less than 10 minutes and I'm very proud of them," Anstis said.</p>
<p>In the other matches of the night Cullinane finished strongly against Ruapehu to win 56-47.</p>
<p>Mint Caf Marist A1 held on for a win against a determined Collegiate side 49-41 and a clear competition leader on points emerged for the first time this season as reigning champs Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School stamped their authority with a commanding performance against Kaiwhaiki 64-36.</p>
