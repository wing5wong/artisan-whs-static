<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui racer Richard Dibben has one hand back on the trophy he last held in 2014 with his unbeaten run in the 2017 Suzuki Series super moto class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dibben has just one round remaining in the series on his home track in Whanganui on&nbsp;<br />Boxing Day and looks a shoe in to reclaim the title from Tauranga's Duncan Hart who has won it for the last three years on end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dibben, however, has been unlucky finishing runner-up during that time after mechanical problems and a minor crash ruling him out of winning contention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This season Dibben has gained maximum points in round 1 at Taupo a fortnight ago and again in round 2 last weekend at Manfield, including bonus points for being fastest qualifier at both venues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has his Honda CRF450 absolutely humming since taking it out of the shed a month before round 1 and in qualifying at Manfield at the weekend Dibben posted the fastest lap time in 36.279 seconds - not bad for an off-road machine with road tyres.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In each of the two races at Manfield Dibben was beating Hart ( Yamaha YZF450) by up to 9 seconds with fellow Whanganui rider Aiden Brown in third. The trio finished 1,2,3 in that order in both races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dibben goes into the final round at the Cemetery Circuit on Boxing Day with 101 points, while Hart has 88 and Brown 76.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While he has a handy series lead, Dibben knows full well he can be caught, especially if he backs off the throttle or has a DFN (did not finish).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I won't be doing that if I can help it," Dibben said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It will handlebars down and catch him if you can, that's Dibben's style and what spectators expect of the Keown Honda motorcycle mechanic on his home track.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Whanganui street circuit is my favourite track and going to the front is the way I like to race. The old bike is still going well and I don't have any sticking plasters on it despite its age. I've raced this same machine for the past four seasons."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Dowman Contracting, Tyre Shield-sponsored rider is not counting his chickens, but astute judges are backing the hometown racer to make it a clean sweep on Boxing Day before he heads to the street circuits at Nelson on January 2 and Paeroa in February where he has won the last two years running, breaking his own lap record last season.</p>
