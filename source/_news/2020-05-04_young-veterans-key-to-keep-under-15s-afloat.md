As their end-of-season prizegivings were cancelled, the Whanganui Chronicle is continuing its spotlight on Cricket Wanganui's junior representative teams. Today is the Under 15 sides.

Tim Hocquard points to history and statistics across Australasia which shows the early years of secondary school are the period when children are lost to sports.

"Cricket is no exception, a number of players drop out of sport completely, others take up other sports opportunities and a few continue on," he said.

"So in here in Whanganui, when you combine last year's strong Under 13 team with the [remaining] 2018-19 Under 15 team, you could expect an abundance of players and competition for each spot in the team."

However, 2019-20 proved particularly challenging for Cricket Wanganui's Under 15's, as for the entry level season to play Central Districts tournaments, requiring a big lift in skill set and commitment, the first squad muster didn't have the numbers.

"So the season was almost played in two parts, just about two separate teams showing up for Wanganui," said Hocquard.

Before Christmas, outgoing general manager Dilan Raj arranged with the Central Districts association for older players to be included in the side.

"These players were essential in the development of the younger players, so thankfully we saw 'veterans' Josh Allpress, Carter Hobbs, Daniel Burgess and Daniel Austen front up and provide the backbone to a new team - Hobbs and Burgess both Under 17 players."

Still, with 19 players unavailable, Wanganui's rep campaign started with three pre-season matches against Manawatu.

Playing away, Wanganui were 98-5 in the first match before rain stopped play, stranding Whanganui Collegiate players Oscar Maben (28 not out) and Matthew Hocquard (46no) as they were leading a recovery.

Further rain prevented other matches going as scheduled, however the weekend before the Central Districts tournament, Manawatu U15 coach Rick McVerry hastily arranged to bring his side to Whanganui for two games.

The visitors proved too slick, winning both fixtures, although former Huntley 1st XI player Henry Blackley's maiden 50 for Wanganui proved a highlight for coach Dave Berry.

Among the many positives despite the defeats, Hobbs was very tidy behind the stumps, Austen bowled with venom and Matthew Hocquard strangled the batsmen, taking 2-12 off four overs in one game.

"Henry Carver once again provided excellent support for the bowlers by fielding like Jonty Rhodes."

Horowhenua-Kapti cricket hosted the CD Under 15 tournament and put on a fantastic venue.

"The fields were presented as good if not better than most first class grounds and the facilities second to none," said Tim Hocquard.

Again, dispensation was required to bring the four over-age players and allow Wanganui to have a full XI.

"Five games in three days was sure to be a test for our boys," said Tim Hocquard.

"Apart from one toweling from Manawatu, eventual tournament winners, Wanganui came close in every game, most coming right down to the wire."

The sole win was against hosts Horowhenua-Kapiti, thanks to captain Allpess putting on a blistering bowling display with 4-20 off three overs, while Matthew Hocquard hit a cavalier 40 not out to bring the side home.

Other highlights were a hatrick to Hobbs, who also scored a 50 against Marlborough, a run-a-ball 58 from Burgess, while Collegiate 1st XI player George Pearse played some great shots and Benji Anderson did some excellent stand-in wicketkeeping.

"Austen, of Cullinane College, proved to be easily one of the most valuable players for Wanganui with outstanding bowling displays, athletic fielding and just being a great team bloke," said Tim Hocquard.

Hobbs finished with 175 runs, while Matthew Hocquard took eight wickets, closely followed by skipper Allpress with seven.

Moving on to February's interprovincial fixtures and a new –look Wanganui Under 15 team had to take the field, with Hobbs, Burgess and Allpress no longer available due to Collegiate commitments.

Against Horowhenua-Kapiti U15, Wanganui got away to a flyer, thanks to a robust 71 from Monty Sherriff, supported by Mabin (27), Matthew Hocquard (27) and a gutsy Anderson (18).

Wanganui's bowling was tight, with Austen's 2-35 from eight overs a standout, along with two wickets each for Mabin and Hocquard, while Carver bowled the last batsman to confirm the win.

What proved to be the final match of the representative season was against a big-hitting Wairarapa, who had the Wanganui batsmen under the pump before they recovered to 180 all out.

The reliable Mabin top-scored with 53, Austen came into his own with a well-constructed 35, while Anderson shored up his end for hours in a gritty 32.

In reply, Wairarapa rocketed away to 120-1, and although Wanganui fought back to leave them seven wickets down, they still overtook the target with 10 overs to spare.

Mabin, Hocquard and Geordie Abernethy all took two wickets apiece.

"All in all, not a bad season even though the results didn't go Wanganui's way," said Tim Hocquard.

"At times during selection there were up to 16 unavailable for a variety of reasons and a couple of times very late withdrawals hampered what was a tidy but struggling team."

After Wairarapa, Wanganui ultimately couldn't field a side for the last two matches of the season – they had used 20 players in the course of 11 games.

Still, Hocquard pointed to the positives – the representative teams were made up of players from seven different schools and came from five different townships – Blackley actually travelling back from Christ's College in the South Island.

"Most of these are in their fourth and fifth seasons of rep cricket, Hobbs in his sixth.

"A very good foundation for the future.

"We have a number of promising batsmen, and extremely skilful bowlers and given the arrival of new Wanganui coaching next season, look forward to seeing these players progress."

Hocquard wanted to give acknowledgement to the four older players who came back to play for the Under 15's and made significant contributions so the side could be competitive.

"Cricket Wanganui appreciates the generosity of Whanganui Collegiate School in preparing and making available pitches for rep matches, and the use of their practice facilities for the team over the season."
