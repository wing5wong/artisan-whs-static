<p><strong>Senior Get 2 Go</strong> - 1 March 2017</p>
<p>This year is the first year that Hillary Outdoors has held a Senior Get 2 Go Adventure Race. WHS took 7 teams down to the race with 3 Boys Teams and 2 girls teams. Each team had 4 students in it.</p>
<p>Students spent a beautiful summers day on the Kapiti Coast running up and down sand dunes navigating completing a orienteering course, Mountain biking though farm land and competing in problem solving activity&rsquo;s such as a water transfer problem.</p>
<p>This was a fun day out with all students doing really well and trying hard with a swim in the sea to finish the day a rest those tired legs.</p>
