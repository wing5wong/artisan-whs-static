<p data-bind="text: $data">Former WHS student Melanie Thompson has answered the call that has been ringing in her ears for years.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">And now the student is the teacher.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Thompson was always destined to work with animals and now she has found her niche career as tutor for Ag Challenge in her first term delivering the Level 5 Veterinary Nurse Assistant (Companion Animal) course.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The course is for those who want to make animals like dogs, cats, rabbits, birds and other small companion animals their specialty.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It covers small animal anatomy and physiology, breeding and feeding, health and wellbeing, clinical, and surgical diagnostic skills along with many other tasks that will allow the graduate to work in a veterinary clinic or other animal-related facility.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The course is also delivered within the confines of a working veterinary practice at Wanganui Veterinary Services on Somme Parade.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Thompson grew up on a lifestyle block in Whanganui and her grandparents and aunty owned dairy farms in the district. She was surrounded by small animals, but also is the large beast.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Apart for the dairy cows, Thompson grew up alongside her beloved horses and up until recent years competed in equestrian events.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Now Thompson is content with trekking, it suits her busy career lifestyle.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She is also a graduate of this very course through Ag Challenge, graduating in 2015.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"I was born to work with animals," Thompson said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"I grew up on a lifestyle block and others in my family had dairy farms.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"I had horses growing up, but also surrounded by smaller animals.&nbsp; Even today, I have two cats, a dog and a puppy on its way, it's on order".</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"I worked as a vet nurse at Vets On Carlton in Whanganui for three years and before that I did a season dairy farming in the South Island.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"While I loved it, I much prefer this".</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"Teaching is going to give me so much satisfaction.&nbsp; I started here a month ago and we have a great bunch of students".</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">"Delivering the course in a working clinic allows a hands-on approach and that's crucial," Thompson said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The course is fulltime, five days a week over 40 weeks and while it began in February, Ag Challenge's rolling intake policy allows students to enrol at any time throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>
