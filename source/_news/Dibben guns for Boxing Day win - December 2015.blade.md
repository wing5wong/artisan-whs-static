<p>IN THE BAG: Hometown racer and former WHS student Richie Dibben has refused to play it safe and rest on his points advantage as he hunts down his third Suzuki Series Supermoto title around the Cemetery Circuit on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>Whanganui rider Richie Dibben will be hunting a lap record rather than playing it safe in the Supermoto class at the final round of the Suzuki Series on Boxing Day.</p>
<p>Dibben comes into the final round on the Cemetery Circuit 18 points ahead of nearest rivals Duncan Hart (Tauranga) and Casey Bullock (Reporoa) tied in second place, so is virtually unbeatable as long as he finishes.</p>
<p>The Fordell Dairies-sponsored motorcycle mechanic will be hunting his third Supermoto title after missing the chance last season following a tumble during the penultimate round at Manfeild.</p>
<p>That day Dibben remounted and finished the race, but the rules say remounting after a fall is illegal and he was stripped of series points for the indiscretion. That left Hart in front heading into the final round on the streets of Whanganui.</p>
<p>Dibben won both races on his home track last year, but could not claw back enough points to retain the title he had won in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>Hart won the title.</p>
<p>Ironically, Hart had allegedly fallen and remounted at Hampton Downs last year, but had not been reported or charged with an infringement. By the time the allegation had come to light, the time frame for protesting had elapsed.</p>
<p>This season Dibben has been unbeatable, winning with maximum points at Hampton Downs and again at Manfeild last weekend.</p>
<p>"I could play its safe with the points I've got and just make sure I finish, but I don't want to race like a nana," Dibben said yesterday. "I'll be out to win both races and, in fact, I'd really like to take Toby Summer's lap record of 50.962 seconds. I nearly got it last year when I clocked 51.024s. The bike is going really well and apart from a few gearing changes and suspension adjustments on the day, there's nothing to do but get on and ride."</p>
