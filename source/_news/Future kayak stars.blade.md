<p><strong>PADDLE POWER: &nbsp;Whanganui paddlers (from left) Matt Foster (Katie's Dad), Ben Foster (WHS), Liam Lace (WHS), Katie Foster (WHS), Cambell Tanner (WHS), Brian Scott, Erica Tanner (former WHS), Anna Clifton and Jack Clifton (WHS) were stars of the <span style="line-height: 1.5;">National 10km Championships in Rotorua at the weekend.</span></strong></p>
<p>The majestic Whanganui River continues to prove a fertile breeding ground for potential New Zealand water sport stars of the future.</p>
<p>A team of nine Whanganui kayakers overcame atrocious conditions on Lake Okareka in Rotorua over the weekend to produce excellent results at the national 10km championships, a regatta that also doubled as the final round of the national 10km winter series.</p>
<p>Whanganui Kayak Club coach Brian Scott said the conditions tested many competitors as strong winds hammered the course.</p>
<p>"At times the stronger gusts literally blew athletes out of their boats, however, all Whanganui athletes managed to stay upright to claim some excellent results," Scott said yesterday.</p>
<p>In the national 10km event seven of the nine Whanganui athletes came away with medals, including three golds, one silver and three bronze.</p>
<p>Both Anna Clifton (U13) and <strong>Katie Foster</strong> (U14 - WHS student)) won gold in their divisions along with Scott himself who won the open men's multisport class.</p>
<p>The silver was won by <strong>Liam Lace</strong> (WHS student) in the U16 event with <strong>Jack Clifton </strong>(WHS student)&nbsp;close behind taking bronze. The other bronze medals were won by <strong>Erica Tanner</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) in the open woman's division and <strong>Cambell Tanner </strong>(WHS student) in the u18 men's division.</p>
<p>Because the race was also the final race in the national series some of the Whanganui team were also eligible to contest the series having competed in at least two of the provincial races.</p>
<p>Of the six eligible all placed in the top three in their age groups, including three wins.</p>
<p>The three winners were Anna Clifton (U13), <strong>Katie Foster</strong> (U14) and<strong> Liam Lace</strong> (U16). These results were backed up by <strong>Jack Clifton</strong> who finished second to <strong>Lace</strong> in the U16 men's division, and <strong>Cambell Tanner</strong> and <strong>Matt Foster</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) who finished third in the U18 men's and open men's multisport classes.</p>
<p>"The 10km winter series and nationals have been good base work for the paddlers as they move into the start of the summer sprint season," Scott said.</p>
<p>"However, there is still unfinished local business in both team and individual boats over the longer distances. Many of the 10km competitors, along with their club mates, are also contesting the regular monthly prognostics race on the river against rowers and waka ama.</p>
<p>"Like the other two codes our paddlers are using the prognostic races to gear up for the final long race - The River Challenge (formerly the Four Bridges)."</p>
<p>Scott said anyone wanting to know more about paddling can check the Whanganui Multisport website http://whanganuimultisport.weebly.com/ or come to the club opposite Andion Lodge on a Saturday morning for a beginners session at 10.30am.</p>
