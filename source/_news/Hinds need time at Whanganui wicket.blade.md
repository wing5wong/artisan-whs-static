<p><strong>WHS student, Jessica Watkin is now a senior member of the Central District Hinds</strong>, although she and her team mates struggled for runs against the Wellington Blaze at the weekend.</p>
<p>The Central District Hinds offered significant opportunities to their three Whanganui-based players in their two pre-season games against the Wellington Blaze at Victoria Park over the weekend.</p>
<p>Looking to follow up from a good 2015-16 season where the Hinds made the national final, Whanganui's Michelle Mitchell has taken over the captaincy from Kate Broadmore, which was planned in the post-season.</p>
<p>Also taking on more prominent roles are top allrounder Jessica Watkin, part of the White Ferns training performance group, and Lisa Grant, who was used as No3 batter in the Saturday match.</p>
<p>It was not the best beginning for the Hinds on a grass wicket on Saturday, as the 45-over game was wrapped up early when they were bowled out for 95, with Wellington reaching 96-4 in reply.</p>
<p>Mitchell said they then sent out some more Hinds batters with the Blaze to get further practice.</p>
<p>"Today [Sunday], is more of a game-like situation," she said.</p>
<p>"Something that we need to work on is running between the wickets."</p>
<p>Run outs from miscommunication blighted the innings.</p>
<p>Watkins bowled her full ten overs of spin consecutively in both games, taking a couple of wickets.</p>
<p>Without strike bowler Hannah Rowe, the Hinds had to rely on Rosemary Mair to step up, while one highlight was a very good slips catch from Melissa Hanson.</p>
