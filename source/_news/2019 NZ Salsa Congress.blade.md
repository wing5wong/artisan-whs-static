<p><span>Sophie and Tobias Perkins attended / performed at the 2019 NZ Salsa Congress held in Wellington on Queens Birthday weekend.</span></p>
<p><span>This is their second year preforming at the Wellington Congress where they attended a two day workshop held by Salsa Champions from around the world. </span></p>
<p><span>Sophie and Tobias have only been learning Salsa for 18 months so this was very exciting for them both.</span></p>
<p>Well done Tobias and Sophie!&nbsp; How fantastic - to be part of the biggest Latin Dance Event in New Zealand where some <span>of the best Latin dance instructors and dancers from&nbsp;</span><span>around</span><span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span><span>world attend</span>!</p>
