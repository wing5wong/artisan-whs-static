The Annual Quiz Night on Wednesday 17 March was a smashing success - well done to all 23 teams who battled it out through 10 tough rounds, our annual plank competition, and Lennarts rubber chicken to conclude the 2021 quiz night! Our team **'Gnomeo & Juliet' took out the win for the evening**, featuring Ben White, Calum Sinclair, Finnian Sinclar, Olivia Bedwell and Sophia Bedwell. **Best dressed went to the COVID Busters**, and our **Plank Winner went to Calum Sinclair** who managed to go over 11 minutes.
 
A massive shout-out to our amazing team of prefect and teacher helpers who made this event possible and a big thanks to our sponsors Pak n Save, Japanese Kitchen and McDonald's. This couldn't have been done without you, thank you all so very much!

Also, a big thank you to Rebecca Allardice for taking these amazing photos!
