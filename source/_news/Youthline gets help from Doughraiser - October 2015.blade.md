<p>GOOD WORKS: &nbsp;Pictured at Domino's Pizza in Wanganui last night are Sarah Spence (left) and Francesca Palmer, both former Wanganui High School students.</p>
<p>Wanganui's Domino's Pizza took part in a national effort by the pizza chain to raise $30,000 for&nbsp;Youthline.</p>
<p>Described as the "first national fundraiser of its kind in New Zealand" by&nbsp;Youthline&nbsp;national spokesman Stephen Bell, the fundraiser involves the chain's 91 outlets.</p>
<p>From 4pm to 9pm one dollar&nbsp;from&nbsp;every pizza sold went towards Youthline's Go Forward suite: online tools designed for youth support and personal development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"They are making a very real contribution to New Zealand's young people and, through them, to our country's future," Mr Bell said.</p>
<p>Domino's Pizza general manager Scott Bush said the chain "really value the work that&nbsp;Youthline&nbsp;consistently do.</p>
<p>"We have been blown away by how many touchpoints they have with youths in New Zealand and we also understand the expense of running such a successful and multi-faceted organisation. We have set a target of $30,000 for this nationwide &lsquo;Doughraiser' but I hope we smash this figure out of the park."</p>
<p>In addition to fundraising the company has developed an employment and training programme for young people called Connect the Dots.</p>
<p>"This programme gives participants hands-on industry experience and takes place at a Domino's store over two days. Participants learn basic food handling, customer service and how to be a good employee. Upon completion of the course they are fast tracked to a job within Domino's, or can use their new skills to gain employment in any other food handling role," Mr Bush said.</p>
