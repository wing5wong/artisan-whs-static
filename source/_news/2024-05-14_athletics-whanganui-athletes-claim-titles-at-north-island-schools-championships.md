Fifteen-year-old [Whanganui](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/whanganui/) High School athlete Kaylee Bisschoff (Year 11) has made a big impact on the athletics track since her arrival from Pretoria, South Africa, in December.

At the weekend, Bisschoff added the North Island Schools intermediate girls 80m hurdles title to the New Zealand Under-16 title won last month.

Bischoff, although small in stature, is technically excellent over the hurdles with a lightning-quick turnover. At the New Zealand Championships in March, she only qualified for the final in third place but nailed that final with a half-second personal best of 12.05s.

In Palmerston North on Saturday, Bischoff was under pressure from the Waikato Bay of Plenty athletes but held her nerve and her form to win in 12.43s into a slight headwind.

Bischoff also finished fifth in the 300m hurdles, one place behind Grace Fannin (Whanganui Girls’ College) with both setting substantial personal bests.
