Ross Taylor Bat Tournament 

The team had two convincing wins on the first day against Kuranui College and Paraparaumu College, 

The second day, we lost to Wairarapa College in the morning, then another close loss to Feilding High School. 

In the last round robin game, we played the eventual winners of the tournament, St John's College, with another loss. 

This saw the team playing off for 3rd and 4th, losing to Feilding High School. 

Thanks to coach, Steve and all the best to our Year 13's Ryan Meredith, Nick Burroughs, Harry Burroughs, Max Comrie and Aidan Muir.
