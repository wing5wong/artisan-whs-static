Congratulations to Callista Booth-Richards awarded 3rd place in the New Zealand Chinese Calligraphy Competition 2020! 
Callista was in the Secondary School Non-Native section.

Her prize was a beautifully illustrated book with a collection of this years most recognized entries. She also received tradition Chinese art in the shape of book marks.

Well done Callista!
