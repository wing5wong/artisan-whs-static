<p><strong>TROPHY HUNTER: WHS student Keightley Watson already has the Australian ACT and Queensland judo titles in the bag and is aiming to add the Sydney International title in his grade.</strong></p>
<p><span>Three young Wanganui Judo Club fighters have their sights set firmly on the Sydney International at the Olympic Stadium in September.</span></p>
<p><span>All three are from the well-known Watson judo family and heavily in-form for the upcoming challenge.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Keightley Watson</strong> <strong>won gold and bronze at the New Zealand Secondary Schools Judo Championships</strong> in Tauranga at the weekend, while younger sibling Callaghan won gold at the primary school competition running in conjunction.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Keightley</strong> at just 15 is fighting rivals up to 18, while Callagham at 11 also punches above his weight.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Tauranga Keightley won gold in the 81kg+ weight group, then claimed bronze in the open weight division. Given he was one of the youngest competitors at the secondary schools tournament, it a great result.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Callaghan's gold topped off a successful weekend for the brothers.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>While both will be forces to be reckoned with in Australia, <strong>Keightley</strong> in particular, will be favoured in his division. This year he has already claimed the ACT and Queensland Opens in his grade.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Another WHS student, older cousin <strong>Kasey Watson</strong> (17) was selected to compete at this year's Oceania tournament, but decided not to go. He is, however, keen to tackle the Australians in September.</span></span></p>
