<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Brothers, Keightley and Callaghan Watson came back with three gold medals and two silvers from the South Island Judo Championships in Christchurch.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Unlike the Steelform Wanganui rugby team, it was a successful sojourn down to Canterbury for Whanganui judo brothers Keightley and Callaghan Watson at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Keightley, 16, won gold medals in both the Cadet Men's over 90kg for 15 to 17-year-olds, and the Cadet Open Weight grade on Saturday.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>He then stepped up to the Junior Men's (18-20 years) over 100kg, winning gold, and then took silver in the Junior Open Weight.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Ross Watson said his son has picked up 15 more points towards receiving his black belt, which actually takes him 30 points above the required level of 100.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He wants to get the black belt by 'Batsugan' - which is winning six fights in a row against judokas of equal or higher grade with no break between fights - not by Kata which is demonstrating your skill in slow motion with another judoka."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Younger brother Callaghan Watson, 12, missed out on a medal in Senior Boys over 66kg (11-14 years) but went on to get the silver in the Senior Boys Open Weight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Callaghan Watson hopes to improve his form at the New Zealand championships in two weeks time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Older sibling Keightley had a quick turnaround as the family flew back into Palmerston North, and then last night he departed from Wellington to fly to Canberra where he will train for a week at the Australian Institute of Sport with the Australian Junior men's team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This opportunity comes courtesy of the Judo Federation of Australia, who approached us last week to see if Keightley would be part of their team build up for the junior worlds - 18-20 years of age - being held in Croatia in October," said Ross Watson.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I suppose this has come on the back of Keightley's recent success at the Sydney International, where he defeated their three heavyweight fighters selected for the worlds quite convincingly, so they want a big heavyweight to help prepare them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The camp will be an organised week of 'Randori' (fighting) and technical work in a mini competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will also be individual focus meetings, hydrotherapy sessions and class work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Keightley will be back in time to join Callaghan to compete at the New Zealand Judo Championships in Wellington on September 27.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The brothers last competition for 2017 will be at the Melbourne International Open in October, which includes a two-day training camp afterwards.</p>
