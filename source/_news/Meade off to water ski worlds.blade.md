<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui water skier Brent Meade was a late inclusion in the New Zealand team departing for the under 21 World Water Ski Championships in Dnipro Ukraine last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 20-year-old apprentice builder did not initially put his name forward for the team because of work commitments, but a late defection prompted Meade to reconsider and board the flight to Austria last week to cram in one final week of training in preparation for the main event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"After receiving a last minute call up from New Zealand team selectors there has been very little time to prepare and organise for this event, winter training has been complicated by cold weather and closures at Lake Wiritoa for duck shooting'" father Simon Meade said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The opportunity to spend seven days training in Austria, a country more familiar to New Zealanders for snow skiing than water skiing, will be extremely worthwhile and give Brent that all important familiarisation and some adjustment to the time difference. Staying in the tourist town of Villach will be an experience in itself on the 20-year-old apprentice builder."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As current regional record-holder, jump is the one event that Meade hopes will elevate him into the top 20 and although a final spot in the top 12 is probably outside of his current ability there is never anything certain in the world of sport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With a current personal best jump of 46.9 meters he will need to be in the mid-50 metre range to put any pressure on the stars of under 21 mens jump.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With Meade also slaloming and tricking there will be plenty of time on the water as part of a six-person team. Competition runs July 13 to 16.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Water Ski Club president Ron Bakker conceded competition would be tough for Meade up against the best in the world for his age group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Brent can only benefit and improve from the experience and the trip will stand him in good stead and help him immensely on his return to age group level in New Zealand," Bakker said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Training hasn't been the easiest with Lake Wiritoa being unusually busy this winter with lots of boats and, of course, duck shooting."</p>
