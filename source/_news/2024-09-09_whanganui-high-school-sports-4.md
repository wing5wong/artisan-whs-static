Some outstanding performances from the team. 

🏀Day 1 yesterday for our SNR boys basketball 

We came out firing to create a lead vs St Bernard’s College and managed to hold it all game, bit sluggish and fundamentally had some jitters but final score was 75-62 vs a team that was rated 2nd in our pool at the start of tournament.

🏀G2 vs PNBHS

Couple injuries and early foul trouble saw us lack confidence and unfortunately put us on the back foot all game vs the #1 team in our pool

Loss   61-88
