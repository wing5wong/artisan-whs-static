👋🇯🇵 Farewell, Waseda Jitsugyo High School! 🇳🇿❤️

Today we said goodbye to our wonderful visiting students from Waseda Jitsugyo High School, Tokyo, Japan. Over the past two weeks, they’ve explored our region, experienced Kiwi life, and created friendships we hope will last a lifetime.

A huge thank you to our amazing Whanganui High School buddies, who went above and beyond — from supporting our visitors at school to organising fun weekend outings. You’ve been incredible hosts and true ambassadors for our school.

Safe travels, Waseda Jitsugyo — we look forward to hosting students from your school in March next year.✈️💌
