It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Mrs Yuko (Kathy) Irving. Mrs Irving was a long-serving Japanese language teacher at Whanganui High [](<>)School. She fostered close relationships with sister city schools in Nagaizumi-cho, which resulted in wonderful cultural opportunities for students from both Japan and Whanganui High School. Many of her students continued their love of Japanese language learning beyond secondary school. Mrs Irving was a generous, knowledgeable mentor to colleagues outside of Whanganui, assisting them with best practice and teaching methodologies.

Many former students and fellow teachers will remember Mrs Irving with great fondness, gratitude and respect.

お悔やみ申し上げます
