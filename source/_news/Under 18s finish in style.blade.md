<p><strong>WHS student Osborne able to breach the defence of the Wairarapa Bush U18 team in Masterton on Saturday 1 October.</strong></p>
<p>The Air Chathams Wanganui Under 18s wrapped up a satisfying season with their second straight win on the road, beating Wairarapa Bush U18 47-34 in Masterton on Saturday.</p>
<p>For the Wanganui players, the curtain raiser game to the Mitre 10 Heartland clash at Memorial Park was their first time playing on an artificial turf.</p>
<p>"There was a really high pace, high tempo on that surface," said coach Jerome McCrea.</p>
<p>Winger Duan Marino scored a hat trick of tries, while fullback Adam Boult got a double.</p>
<p>Centre Cody Hemi, winger Luke Foster, halfback <strong>Griffin Culver</strong> and flanker <strong>Dylan Bowater</strong> scored the other tries.</p>
<p>McCrea said the midfield trio of Hemi, first-five <strong>Mitchell Millar</strong> and second-five <strong>Blair Osborne</strong> were able to breach the defence all game, once the pack got them some go forward.</p>
<p>Foster and Boult also made some great runs.</p>
<p>The win completed a good HYRC Series for Wanganui, who only lost to the Wellington Samoans and had back-to-back road wins over Poverty Bay and Wairarapa Bush, after the home victory over Horowhenua-Kapiti as well as beating Thames Valley in preseason.</p>
<p>"That was the goal right through - to try and beat these Heartland teams," said McCrea.</p>
<p>"Really good end to the season. The boys are stoked."</p>
