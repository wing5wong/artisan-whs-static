<p>On Wednesday the 5th of September, <strong>Joseph Parker</strong> was welcomed to Whanganui High school by Kia Whaiora and Nga Piringa Whaanau with a Haka Powhiri.&nbsp;We were very pleased to give our guests the most hospitable experience which comprised of Iwi Whanau, members of&nbsp;the local Samoa community and Josephs own family and entourage.</p>
<p><span>The purpose of his visit, to speak with our students about his journey so far as a Heavyweight Boxing champion but also about his family life and up bringing.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once the Kai and refreshments were completed he made his way down to Seddon gym accompanied by our Principal, our Maori department staff and our Heads of Maori both male and female. On his arrival to the gym he was welcomed by the Pasifika group where he was invited to participate in a cultural dance. Humbled he stood and danced with kaumatua and whanau of Samoa. On completion of his speech he opened the floor for the students to ask any burning questions. He worked the crowd, he laughed with them and he even managed to turn a couple of awkward questions into humorous ones.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To you Joseph and family, we enjoyed your visit to our kura, we appreciate how humble and down to earth you are as a person and&nbsp;both our Maori and Pasifika communities are richer for having you as a role model. Your whanau, community, country and people are very proud.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Tena koe e te Manukura!</span></p>
