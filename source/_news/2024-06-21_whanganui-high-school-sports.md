What an amazing day our school had yesterday hosting the USA Midwest Thunderbirds U18 Girls Rugby Team. 

Our Girls really enjoyed the experience and bonded with the team after the game. USA won the game 55-0, with some strong, fast players showing their skill on the field. 

Very proud of our rangatahi who never gave up and enjoyed the experience of playing an international squad. 

Thanks again to Max Comrie capturing the game on his camera.
