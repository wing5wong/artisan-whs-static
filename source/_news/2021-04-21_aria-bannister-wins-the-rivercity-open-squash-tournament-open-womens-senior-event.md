**WHS year 9 student Aria Bannister won the RiverCity Open Squash Tournament over the weekend.**

Aria was the number 2 seed for the event defeating current Central Districts Senior Woman’s rep Emma Rowe 3 games to 0.

It was Arias first Open Women’s Senior event win at just 13 years of age, a very rare achievement for someone her age in New Zealand.

This week she heads off to the NZ Age Group Swimming Champs with fellow WHS students in Wellington before contesting the Whanganui Open Squash tournament in a few weeks time.
