After the school holidays both the School Counsellors will be available to students via email. 

We will reply to your email as soon as we can during School hours.  From there we can organise the best way to talk. 

Our emails are:  
Jacqui -  mckenzie.j@whs.ac.nz  
Terry  -   tubman.t@whs.ac.nz

Look after yourselves and your families.  
Please ask for help if you need it.

_Jacqui McKenzie and Terry Tubman_
