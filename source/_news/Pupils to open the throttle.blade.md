<p><span>The majority of these Whanganui High School riders who competed in Rotorua earlier this year will again be in action at the North Island Secondary Schools Championship at Languard Bluff on Friday.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Motorcycle Club will host more than 70 riders when the North Island Secondary Schools Motocross Championship rolls into town on Friday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event, at the club's track at Languard Bluff, starts at 10am when riders will compete in four classes ranging from 85cc bikes up to 250cc 4-stroke machines. Year 9 to 13 riders are eligible to compete.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 12-14 year 125cc class Tauranga's Brodie Connelly, fresh from finishing 13th in the world juniors two weeks ago in Australia, will be hard to beat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School will have a big presence at the event. Hometown riders to watch out for are in the 250cc 4 stroke class and include James Rountree, Oliver Dennison, Tom Gilligan and Blake Rountree.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the 125cc 15-19 year grade James Rountree and Jaxon Watt should be up in the leading pack, while in the 13-16 year 85cc class the ever-improving Troy Bullock will be looking for a top result.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the girls' class, Ajah Sullivan has just moved up to a 125cc machine and will be looking for a top-five placing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A total of 16 Whanganui High School students are competing.</p>
