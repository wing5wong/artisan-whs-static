<p>CHILL VIBES: Whanganui band Drones, from left are Ethan Coleman (drums), Adam Robinson (rhythm guitar), Andrew Condon (bass) and Isaac Chamberlain (lead guitar).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the day every new band dreams of &mdash; the release of their first single.</p>
<p>And for four young Whanganui musicians, three former WHS students; &mdash; Andrew Condon,<strong> Isaac Chamberlain,&nbsp;</strong><strong>Adam Robinson and Ethan Coleman</strong> &mdash; that day has come.</p>
<p><em>Caged</em> is an original song from city band Drones and is the feature of a release event at Mint Bar and Cafe next Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to celebrate our successes so far &mdash; we all love to play live,&rdquo; bassist Andrew Condon said.</p>
<p>Gigs have been plentiful since Drones featured in this year&rsquo;s Battle of the Bands &mdash; winning its regional final and making it all the way to the national final. &ldquo;Although we did not place, almost everything we&rsquo;ve done since has been a result of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drones has played at more than a dozen&nbsp;venues throughout the North Island since the contest and is enjoying a growing fan base. &ldquo;A lot of people who we did not expect love our music &mdash; you could say we are unintentionally appealing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Condon describes the band&rsquo;s style as instrumental rock, &ldquo;chill vibes, atmospherically clean&rdquo; and a mix of &ldquo;high energy and nice feelsy&rdquo; material. They play without vocals, although the band is open to adding vocals later on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mint show will mark the band&rsquo;s first year together and its first show at home since April.</p>
<p>The single will be available for download on various digital platforms and is accompanied by a video, shot at various city locations, and produced by friend <strong>Josh Dey</strong> (former WHS student).</p>
<p>Where to next for Drones? &ldquo;Travel the world playing our own original music is something we dream of,&rdquo; Mr Condon said.</p>
<p>Drones can be followed on Facebook and You Tube.</p>
