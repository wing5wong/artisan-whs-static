<p class="element element-paragraph">"Disappear please cast members, I shouldn't see you. You wait patiently."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Head of performing arts at Whanganui High School Colin Hedivan spots some of his cast members peeking out from behind the stage curtains.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The hall is blacked out and silent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A scattering of students sit in chairs throughout the room, waiting in anticipation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A stage light flashes on, the gentle tapping of drums plays through some speakers and suddenly, the actors hit the stage in a clash of vibrant colours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We dance", they sing in the first laid-back tune of their production&nbsp;<em>Once On This Island&nbsp;</em>and for the next hour, they do just that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They've been working on this since the beginning of term one, so this is their 14th week," says Hedivan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I believe it's the first time a high school has produced a show which is currently showing on Broadway, which I think is pretty cool."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This is the final run-through for performers, before the production opens on Thursday, May 3 and runs for three nights in a row starting at 7pm in the school hall.<br /><br /></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Once On This Island</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">was recently nominated for best revival on Broadway at the Tony Awards and has been running for about six months.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At its heart, it is a love story and focuses on Ti Moune, a peasant girl guided by the Gods to the other side of their island to help the man she loves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Ours is a junior version, the one on Broadway is a full length which runs for about 90 minutes, our version has about 30 minutes of material cut out from it," says Hedivan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It still has all of the same characters, really it has just cut out some of the numbers."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sophia 'Unga Cribb is fantastic as Ti Moune and this is realised early on when she belts out the first solo performance of the show - her chemistry is strong with Nathaniel Kirk, who plays Daniel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But everyone plays their part, the choreography is great, everyone remembers their lines perfectly and the lighting is used to brilliant effect.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Rehearsing a musical is always a fascinating process, we go through music rehearsals, choreography rehearsals and then we put it all together and it's a huge team effort," Hedivan says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everybody was fantastic today, they're pumped once and they're ready to perform it in front of an audience now."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Tickets cost $10 and can be bought at Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
