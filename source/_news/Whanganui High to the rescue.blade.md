<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Whanganui High School hosting the Mark Ranby Invitational tournament.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School has come to the party and ensured the Mark Ranby Invitational 1st XV rugby tournament has a future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual tournament launched in 2007 is named after All Black No 1001 Mark Ranby, a pupil of original host Freberg High School. However, its last host and current trophy holder Kapiti College has pulled out of the tournament after its local authority decided to charge for ground use.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In stepped WHS with help from the Wanganui Rugby Union.<br />The tournament began on Monday with WHS, Taradale High School, Freberg, Hawera High School and Tawa College vying for top honours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS deputy principal Chris Friedel said he and the school were keen to promote Whanganui as an ideal sporting venue for all codes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Initially the tournament involved Freyberg, Whanganui, Feilding, Havelock and Taradale high schools and when Feilding pulled out in 2012 Kapiti took over its spot. Havelock has since been replaced by Tawa," Friedel said</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This year we have tried to revitalize the tournament in Whanganui. They were having difficulty finding a venue. Kapiti's council were going to charge Kapiti for ground use, so we hatched a plan to host it here working with Wanganui rugby</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I feel really strongly about promoting Whanganui as a sporting venue. We have all the facilities and a supportive network right here in town. The Wanganui Rugby Union has been a huge help supporting the tournament and providing referees, while the Mad Butcher has stepped in supplying sausages for our prizegiving," Friedel said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Kapiti won the title last year, but whoever wins this season goes home with the trophy, a mounted statue of Mark Randy. We (WHS) have won the trophy five times, Tawa four and Kapiti one since its inception."</p>

In the other match-up this morning Tawa plays Taradale.</p>
