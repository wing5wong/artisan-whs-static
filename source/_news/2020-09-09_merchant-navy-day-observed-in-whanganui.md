Every year, on September 3, on whatever day that falls, Merchant Navy Day is celebrated, commemorated and revived for new generations.

September 3, 1939, Britain and France, allies, declared war on Germany. Within hours, the first allied merchant ship, the Athenia, was sunk by a torpedo from a German U-Boat. Casualties were high, with 117 civilian passengers and crew killed.

The Merchant Navy, as it came to be known, was considered the fourth service, but it was not until 10 years ago that Merchant Navy Day was finally officially recognised in New Zealand.

Ask any seaman and they will say that the other three services would have been useless without those volunteers who sailed the ships that carried troops, military equipment, food, fuel and supplies across the oceans of the world.

Last Thursday at 11am, a small gathering assembled at the Cenotaph on Queens Park where Rev David Bebarfald conducted a Christian service in memory and in honour of the men and women of the service.

"I warmly welcome you to this significant day for the Merchant Navy," he began.

The Lord's Prayer was said in English and in Maori, there was a reading, prayers and a valiant attempt by those present to sing For Those in Peril on the Sea, unaccompanied.

Bob McDougall, maritime historian and author of New Zealand Naval Vessels (1989), spoke for a short time about the significance of Merchant Navy Day.

The service ended with the Ode of Remembrance, recited by flag bearer Geoff Chowles, a recording of The Last Post and a final prayer. Wreaths were laid during the service.

In attendance were a small number of former merchant seamen, including Trevor Gibson, John Hair and Geoff Chowles, family of merchant seamen, members of the RSA, members of the public, and two Navy cadets — Lieutenant Commander Sharon Tutaki and Cadet Angel Welch.

Angel joined the Navy cadets because she wants to join the Navy and be a marine engineer. Her study focus at Whanganui High School reflects that goal.

Sharon Tutaki joined the Cadet Forces 15 years ago when her son joined TS Calliope as a Navy cadet.

"First I was on the support committee, then they wanted officers … they told me if I accepted the role I had to stay on, even though my son might leave. I've been here since."

Sharon says her biggest concern is recruiting: keeping the unit numbers up.

Some of those gathered stayed after the service, swapping yarns and reminiscing, in conversation peppered with seafaring terms and names fondly remembered.
