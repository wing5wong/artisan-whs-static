<p class="element element-paragraph">A former Catalonian and now Whanganui resident watched with mixed emotions as violence and turmoil boiled over in her home country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui resident Queralt Scott comes from the area of Spain known as Catalonia<br />She watched with horror images of people with bloodied faces resulting from police violence in Northeastern Spain on October 1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The people were voting in a referendum that asked the question - "Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Spanish government had declared the referendum illegal and sent 4000 police clad in riot gear, armed with rubber bullets and carrying batons to the polling booths.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mrs Scott says it is a complex situation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Politics is one of those topics that is easy to give your opinion - like religion, it is not my field and I find it a bit complicated when somebody asks me about the situation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I am from Barcelona, from a Catalan family but I can only speak for myself and for my experiences.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In my own family, there are different versions of how to explain the Spanish reality nowadays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everyone has different ideas about what would be the best solution to make everybody happy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The only certainty is that something has to change," she says.</p>
