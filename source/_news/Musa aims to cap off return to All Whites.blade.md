<p><strong>Former WHS student James Musa earned his second All Whites cap in the 6-1 win over the Solomon Islands on Friday.</strong></p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It may have taken more than three years, but James Musa has earned a second All Whites cap, and could add a third as soon as tomorrow.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The midfielder came off the bench in the 6-1 win over the Solomon Islands on Friday night in Auckland, and will be hoping to be involved - possibly from the start when the two teams meet again in Honiara, in the second leg of their World Cup qualifying tie.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s obviously been a while,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said yesterday. &lsquo;&lsquo;But it&rsquo;s good to see the lads again, and to play in New Zealand.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Musa was last on these shores at the start of last year, playing for Team Wellington in the national league, and is now at Sporting Kansas City in the United States. His previous All Whites cap came in May 2014, off the bench against South Africa.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He has been called up by Anthony Hudson once previously, in November that year, for friendlies against China and Thailand, but didn&rsquo;t get on the field then, and from mid-2015 until the end of last year, he was sidelined by eligibility issues.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">But now he&rsquo;s in the clear, and he&rsquo;s back in the frame as well, giving Hudson another option in midfield, and one with more of a defensive mindset.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;I just stuck to my guns and kept doing what I was doing, making a career for myself in America, and I knew that eventually the opportunity would arise,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Musa, who turned 25 in April.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;I was just happy to get on the pitch, and contribute to the result, and I feel like I did all right.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">As their thoughts turn to tomorrow&rsquo;s match, the All Whites are set to make four changes, and possibly more, from the team that won on Friday.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Chris Wood and Ryan Thomas have been released back to their clubs in Europe, while Michael Boxall and Michael McGlinchey are unlikely to feature, as both are one yellow card away from a suspension that would have to be served in November&rsquo;s intercontinental World Cup qualifying playoff.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">McGlinchey didn&rsquo;t train yesterday, as All Whites officials sought to determine whether he in fact was already suspended, having previously received a yellow card at last year&rsquo;s Oceania Nations Cup.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The slate was believed to have been wiped clean after that tournament, but exact details of the regulations have been hard to come by.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Musa stands to benefit from those absences, as he could come in either in midfield or in the back three, and he said he was sure the team wouldn&rsquo;t be affected by the departures of Wood and Thomas.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;For us it makes no difference. There&rsquo;s a squad here, and we&rsquo;re all good players. The depth is there and it&rsquo;s a good opportunity for people to step in and make their claim for a place in the starting XI.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Musa has never played in Honiara before, but he&rsquo;s heard the stories of how unforgiving it can be. &lsquo;&lsquo;Obviously the playing conditions aren&rsquo;t going to be the best, past teams have seen that,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;For me personally, I play in America, and it&rsquo;s pretty hot over there, so for me it won&rsquo;t be much of a difference to what I&rsquo;m used to. The surface might be a bit worse, but it&rsquo;s just conditions.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re all pros, it&rsquo;s one game, it&rsquo;s 90 minutes, so we just have to get through it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The All Whites were set to leave Auckland for Honiara early today, with tomorrow&rsquo;s match scheduled to kick off at 3pm (NZ time).</p>
