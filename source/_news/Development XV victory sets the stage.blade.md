<p><span>Fullback and former WHS student <strong>Grayson Tihema</strong> diving in to score his try at the end of the first half against Wairarapa-Bush Development on Saturday.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Toyota Development XV emulated their senior team while taking a big step towards regaining the RDO Shield when they put current holders Wairarapa-Bush Development to the sword 50-17 in Saturday's Cooks Gardens curtain-raiser.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The home side's loose forward trio of Jackson Campbell, <strong>Cade Robinson</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) and Kieran Hussey were very strong in the set piece and made some hard tackles, although some of the timing was off in the second quarter as the team put themselves under unnecessary pressure with arms getting up above the shoulder of their targets.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Referee Glenn Collins handed out a couple of team warnings and eventually sinbinned reserve back Te Rangitapu McLeod late in the second half.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But by then Wanganui were rolling as the gaps had opened up in the centre of the park, with midfielders Osea Tarogi and Eric Sagapolutele able to run through large holes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lock Taione Ratu was dominant running with the ball in one hand, and on the flat, dry track, Wanganui were able to get the bounce of the ball on a couple of passes that went to ground to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fullback <strong>Grayson Tihema</strong> had a strong first half, laying on the first of winger Elijah Ah Chong's two tries and scoring another himself with quick dashes and steps off both feet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui's primary concern was Wairarapa-Bush's speedy little flanker turned winger Epeli Rayaqayaqa, who ran low and fast across the turf to score two smart individual tries while laying on his team's consolation five-pointer with time nearly up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Not bad, a bit of helter skelter," said Wanganui coach Denis Edwards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Once we settled it down a bit - that testostrone. The offloads were good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Edwards also praised his inside backs and loose forwards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Getting the better of early territory, Wanganui struck first as prop Wiremu Cottrell and first-five Josh Fifita had a crack at the line before the ball was freed to Campbell, who dragged two tacklers over the line.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A series of penalties with lineouts gave Wairarapa-Bush the chance to flip the momentum, and despite resolute tackling they eventually got through after Rayaqayaqa wrong-footed the defence and sprinted back through the players turning from being at the lineout to score in the corner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui hit back immediately as <strong>Tihema</strong> fielded a clearance and stepped around the chasing forwards to find the gap - sending the pass to <strong>Robinson</strong> who put Ah Chong over in the corner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tihema scored right on halftime when he snapped up a loose Ratu pass and dashed between the last defenders to go under the posts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The hosts had a bad start to the second stanza with a shallow kick being grabbed by Rayaqayaqa, who spotted the big gap beside the disengaging ruck and dashed through, wrong-footed Tihema and went under the posts for 17-12.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui were tested on their line but came up trumps in every one-on-one tackle and driving down attempts at rolling mauls, eventually breaking out as Sagapolutele showed great strength after going back to get a loose pass and then hold off his tacklers until he could unload to winger <strong>Karl Pascoe</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) who sprinted into the corner and around to improve <strong>Tihema's</strong> kick.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Moments later, Tarogi fended his way through the line on his 40m and put the foot down to win the race to the corner to make them safe at 29-12.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Despite being reduced to 14 with 17 minutes left, Wanganui were now running hot as Tarogi picked up another bounce ball and spread to Ah Chong to get his double, while <strong>Robinson</strong> got free on the other sideline to dive over by the corner flag.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Throwing it around, the ball came to Sagapolutele in the gap off a Campbell pass to score, before Wairarapa-Bush got the final say as another Rayaqayaqa sycthing run was stopped just short and the ball was transferred out to first-five Pu'a Tafa at the corner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Development's next game will be against Horowhenua Kapiti Development in Levin this Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Wanganui Development 50 (Elijah Ah Chong 2, Jackson Campbell, <strong>Grayson Tihema, Karl Pascoe</strong>, Osea Tarogi, <strong>Cade Robinson</strong>, Eric Sagapolutele tries; <strong>Tihema</strong> 5 con) bt Wairarapa Bush Development 17 (Epeli Rayaqayaqa 2, Pu'a Tafa tries; Tristan Fluety con). HT: 17-5.</em></p>
