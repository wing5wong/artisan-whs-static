<p>Although weather conditions were less than ideal, life guards assembled at the Castlecliff Surf Club for the first day of summer patrols yesterday.</p>
<p>As the wind swept up the beach, the surf lifeguards assembled inside the club rooms to check their gear before heading out on patrol.</p>
<p>Half the guards were heading for Mowhanau Beach at Kai Iwi while the rest set up the patrol and put out the flags at Castlecliff.</p>
<p>"We don't expect swimmers on days like this," said life guard Vincent Nowak.</p>
<p>"We sometimes get wind surfers in this weather and if people turn up to swim, we advise against it.</p>
<p>Mr Nowak, who is beginning his sixth summer as a life guard said he would like to remind Whanganui people about some basic beach safety tips as the summer season starts.</p>
<p>"Swim between the flags and talk to lifeguards," he says.</p>
<p>"We are here to help and give friendly advice."</p>
<p>Unsupervised children coming to the beach are a concern for life guards and Mr Nowak said there are rules about guardianship.</p>
<p>"Children who are too young to be left at home alone are also too young to be swimming at the beach on their own.</p>
<p>"It's important to stay within your depth as well.</p>
<p>"Children will follow an older swimmer in to deeper water so it's important to stay within their depth if you are supervising them."</p>
<p>Life guards will be on duty every day from midday until 6pm at Castlecliff and 5.30pm at Mowhanau.</p>
