This year’s Whanganui A&P Show’s success was demonstrated by the numbers in the equestrian events.

There were 430 horses and 305 riders at the show at the Whanganui racecourse at the weekend before last, well up on last year’s numbers.

The Whanganui Agricultural and Pastoral Association is a charity with a five-member volunteer committee and a team of helpers. Together they spend 10 months planning and organising the show.

The aim of the charity is to promote equestrian activities in Whanganui.

The flat classes are for displaying perfect movement, conformation, temperament and impeccable presentation of both horse/pony and rider.

The show jumping and show hunter courses put skill, strength, endurance and concentration of both rider and horse/pony to the test.

On Saturday evening, we had the highlight of the show — the Horse and Pony High jump. This exciting event saw former WHS student **Ella Kingston on Doctor Jones take out the pony high-jump with a height of 1.40m**, and Nic O’Leary on Ngahiwi Chrome Extreme win the horse highjump with a height of 1.65m.

This event had the crowd on its feet as ponies, horses and riders were challenged until the best combination won.

**Ella Kingston showed courage to skilfully guide Doctor Jones over the 1.40m jump and was thrilled to have beaten her previous highest jump.**

Sunday’s rain didn’t dampen spirits with high rider and horse numbers competing.

The Whanganui A&P Association thanks all its sponsors and volunteers. Without them the show would not be the wonderful spectacle and successful event that it has become.
