<p>Whanganu's White Fern Jessica Watkin worked her way into the 1st XI on their England tour, but that just meant sharing in the disappointment of the loss to England in the women's Tri Series Twenty20 final at Chelmsford.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealanders made the final against the 50-over world champions, played in the early hours of Monday morning, NZ time, and were beaten by seven wickets.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although experienced openers Sophie Devine and captain Suzie Bates got the White Ferns off to a good start, both scoring 31, the middle order was pinned down and struggled, finishing 137-9 in their 20 overs, with Watkin coming in at No7 and dismissed for five from seven balls after being caught.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">England were also led by their openers Danielle Wyatt (50) and Tammy Beaumont (35) to reach 141-3 at the start of the 18th over, with Watkin conceeding 18 runs from her two overs of spin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After playing in the Ireland tour games earlier in the month, Watkin seized her chance when she was promoted into the top team to face England in their Twenty20 pool match in Bristol on Friday morning, NZ time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although the White Ferns also lost by seven wickets, being bowled out for 129 while England reached 130-3 in the 16th over, Watkin still impressed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She was sent in at No6 with the instruction to get quick runs, and scored 16 from eight balls, including three boundaries, as she moved across to smack the ball to fine leg.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The White Ferns then changed tactics as Watkin was asked to open the bowling with her off-spinners, and got her team on the front foot with 2-27 from her four overs during the batting power play.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Prize scalps Wyatt and Beaumont both gave up catches to Bates off Watkin to have England worried at 22-2, before wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor (51) and Natalie Sciver (39no) led their recovery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was pretty nervous to have to bowl first," Watkin said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I got told before the start of the game and I was thinking about it the whole day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But I guess, getting up having to bat first, made the nerves go a little bit before I bowled.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just didn't really think they were the best team in the world, I just thought it was a net [session] really, out there, and used that as confidence."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Having not expected to play much during her first White Ferns tour, Watkin said it was "surreal" to follow up her success in the Ireland games by getting to face the world champions England.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Such an honour to be out there with them. I learned so much from them and put everything into practice.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Even just being around Suzie, Sophie and Amy [Satterthwaite], I just learn so much off them. Just the simplest things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Carrying a Whanganui sticker on the back of her bat, the 20-year-old said she is feeling the love from 19,000km away.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've had a lot of support from home with coaches, and parents and friends.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"All my family, they're all messaging me every day."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The White Ferns will now face England in three 50-over internationals, starting on Saturday.</p>
