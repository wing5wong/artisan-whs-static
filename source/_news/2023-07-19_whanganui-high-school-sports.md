Another awesome sporting moment for Whanganui High School with our International Students.

We welcome Enno Becher (Year 11) from Germany to our WHS Rowing Squad.

Enno [](<>)started at WHS on Monday also and was in a boat today with our U17 Boys George Hughes (Year 12), Eli Kuehne (Year 12) and Jake Newton (Year 11).

Coach Axel Dickinson said he has fitted in well.
