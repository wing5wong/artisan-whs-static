Another awesome sporting moment for Whanganui High School with our International Students.

We welcome Enno Becher (Year 11) from Germany to our WHS Rowing Squad.

Enno [](<>)started at WHS on Monday also and was in a boat today with our U17 Boys George Hughes (Year 12), Eli Kuehne (Year 12) and Jake Newton (Year 11)

Coach Axel Dickinson said he has fitted in well. 

Great work Enno.
