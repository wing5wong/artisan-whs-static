<p><span>Unique cafe/shop - proud to have almost nothing new - recycling in action.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Jack Mitchell Anyon (former WHS student) is committed to recycling. His caf&eacute;, &lsquo;Article&rsquo; in the old Chronicle building on Drews Ave, is more than a caf&eacute;. There is a good range of mainly New Zealand made and well made clothing from &ldquo;a bygone era,&rdquo; as well as shoes, china, ceramics, kitchenallia and brick-a-brac available for paintings from local artists, which he sells on behalf.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>He is proud of the fact that there is &ldquo;almost nothing&nbsp;</span><span class="text_exposed_show">new in here.&rdquo; The coffee cups are second hand Crown Lynn, the French light shades are likewise second hand as are the tables and chairs. He has a wooden cabinet made in Whanganui, a surplus of requirements from the Museum for which he says, &ldquo;I must have had at least 20 offers.&rdquo; The exceptions for nothing new are light bulbs and drinking glasses.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">His take away cups are fully compostable, including the lids and he uses brown paper bags purchased locally from Stevos in Aramoho. Buying local and ethically is important. His coffee brand is &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Cup&rsquo; supplied by friends who roast their beans at the back of an old bank in Patea. It comes in biodegradable bags, which he returns to them, enabling them to be re-used.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">Jack gets his lemons from the Hospice shop, brings in mint from home and uses his coffee grinds as a fertiliser. &ldquo;Customers bring in surplus stuff to give away,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;such as tomatoes.&rdquo;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">While he is supportive of people reducing their usage of things like plastic and recycling where possible, he believes that government, national and local, needs to provide more incentives to ensure recycling and reuse of everything from plastics to buildings.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">&lsquo;Article&rsquo; is open on Fridays and Saturdays. Check out the pressed tin ceilings. You don&rsquo;t get anything like them in modern buildings.</span></span></p>
