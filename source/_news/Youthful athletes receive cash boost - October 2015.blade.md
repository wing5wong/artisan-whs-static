<p>Five new faces are the latest recipients of grants from the Mitre 10 Mega Wanganui Future Champions Trust.</p>
<p>The five students were announced as receiving $1000 grants each at Wanganui Girls' College during the Dub.Dee.See. Youth Committee Secondary School Sports Awards on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Previously, the seven recipients for the June 2015 intake, who were given $1500 each, included three who got back-to-back grants after being part of the 2014 inaugural group - coming from inline skating and kayaking.</p>
<p>This October's group features all-new faces to get money from the trust, which relies entirely on sponsors and contributions for the $1000-1500 grants, giving every cent it receives back to the athletes.</p>
<p>"It's exciting to once again be able to support some new athletes in sports that the two-year-old trust has not supported previously and this highlights the wide and varied sporting talent we are breeding in Wanganui," Trust chairwoman Philippa Baker-Hogan said.</p>
<p>"Trustees are so grateful to Mitre 10 Mega Wanganui and all our wonderful supporters, who make our regular twice-yearly grants possible."</p>
<p>One of those faces to receive a grant was Wanganui High School student&nbsp;<strong>Blair Osborne</strong>. &nbsp;He was&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">recently selected and competed for the New Zealand Under-17 Mixed Touch team in a development tour in Australia.</span></p>
<p>The allrounder has seen success in basketball, touch and rugby union while at Wanganui High School.</p>
