On 7 November WHS took 1 team of 4 to the Big Bang 6-hour adventure race just out of Levin. 

The team had to be at the start line by 8.00 for a 8.30am start, which this year was in behind Shannon. 

The team started on foot, then moved to mountain bikes, on to a raft, for a short but exciting paddle down the rapids of the old NZ white water kayaking centre, then, foot which included climbing down a waterfall, followed by another quick Mountain bike down into Shannon golf club and across the finish. 

It was a massive day for all students with lots of cramping and blisters but they all made it across the line to finish 11th out of 114 teams and 4th out of the school teams which was a great effort. 

The finishing time was 4 Hours and 44 min. 

Well done to Connor Hoskins, Scott Emerson, Matt Grant and Chase Morpeth! 

Well done team on a massive day.
