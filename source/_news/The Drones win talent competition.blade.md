<p>The Drones win talent competition. Three of the four members in the band are former WHS students; left to right, Adam Robinson, Isaac Chamberlain, Ethan Coleman and other member Andrew Condon.</p>
<p>Three acts were judged winners in the talent show at last week's Thursday Night Street Feast in Whanganui's Majestic Square.</p>
<p>Mainstreet Whanganui event, marketing and promotion manager Kelly Scarrow said the top group was The Drones. They won a $400 paid gig at next year's Caboodle street festival.</p>
<p>Second was Sue Thorby, who won $150 and $30 meal vouchers for the street feast. The Krew were third, and won $100 and meal vouchers. Young singer and keyboard player AJ Malili-Malo-Lauano was highly commended.</p>
<p>The street feasts are usually on the second Thursday of each month. There's none planned for April but Mainstreet is working on something special for May 11, Mrs Scarrow said.</p>
