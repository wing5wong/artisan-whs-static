<p>It's an event that sold out quicker than it takes a rider to complete one stage.</p>
<p>But even with 280 mountainbike riders jumping in front of a computer to secure a prized ticket to the Dodzy Memorial Enduro&nbsp;before they were all snapped&nbsp;up&nbsp;in 90 seconds, when it came to race day no one was able to beat Sam Blenkinsop to the punch.</p>
<p>Christchurch-based Blenkinsop&nbsp;was crowned DME&nbsp;champion for the third consecutive year on Sunday, winning the three-stage event at the Wairoa Gorge in a combined time of 25min 35.04sec.</p>
<p>"I wasn't really expecting it this year," Blenkinsop said after the race.</p>
<p>"I was just doing the same thing as I do every year, which is just have fun. It's a good, chilled race where you race with your friends and have a good time. It's the one event where everyone in New Zealand tries to enter and although it's a race, everyone just having fun more than anything."</p>
<p>Coming off a strong Enduro World Series campaign in 2016, highlighted by finishing third in Argentina in round two, the 28-year-old Norco Factory Racing rider&nbsp;continues to show he's got something to offer the longer, multi-stage&nbsp;discipline after spending the majority of his career in downhill.</p>
<p>However, he said his 2017 targets have all been set towards downhill, hoping to consistently break into the top five on the UCI World Cup and Crankworx circuits.</p>
<p>"We've got a new bike coming and I just feel like the last few years I've struggled in the downhill and I just want to concentrate on that and do the best I can and go from there," he said.</p>
<p>Keegan Wright, competing at the DME for the first time, was second in&nbsp;25min 54.44sec, with Wyn Masters, who crashed on the final stage,&nbsp;third in 25min 56.84sec.</p>
<p>The elite women's section was won by Harriet Harper, last year's runner up.</p>
<p>Harper, who used to live in Nelson, was on form on Sunday, winning all three stages to post a combined time of 30min 35.59sec.</p>
<p>Second place was Anka Martin (32min 17.72sec) and third was Ronja Hill-Wright (32min 35.56sec).</p>
<p>The event&nbsp;is held in memory of James "Dodzy" Dodds who was tragically killed in a hunting accident in 2012.</p>
