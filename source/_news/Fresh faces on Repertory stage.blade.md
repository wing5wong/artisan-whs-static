<p>FRESH FACES: WHS students Ben Clow&nbsp;(former student)&nbsp;and Bee Kirk at work during rehearsals for the upcoming production of Little Red Riding Hood at Repertory Theatre.</p>
<p>Bee Kirk is stage manager for the upcoming production of&nbsp;<em>Little Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;at Repertory Theatre.</p>
<p>This demanding, responsible job is a requirement for Bee's level three NCEA Drama paper, encompassing all aspects of theatre: costume design, prompting, marking out the set plan on the stage floor, notating the blocking, calling and lighting design. As anyone who's been involved with theatre knows there is a myriad of tasks involved in successfully putting a show to stage.</p>
<p>Bee said that theatre lighting is undergoing radical changes. While Repertory still operates from a lighting board, the latest method of controlling the lights is from a laptop computer.</p>
<p>"I found it hard to adjust to, but once you've done a few times it's quite easy," Bee said of the laptop lighting system.</p>
<p>After finishing school Bee would like to study theatre craft further, pursuing her interest in lighting design. Would she be interested in television drama?</p>
<p>"No, I like live theatre. That appeals more. Lighting and set design for live theatre is far more intricate," she replied.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Fairytale High</em>&nbsp;are Bee's favourite shows.</p>
<p>"It was great doing the lighting for them," beams Repertory's latest recruit.</p>
<p>Our original 'Lance, the man from DoC' had to withdraw from the show. Fortunately director Colin Hedivan met his former pupil Benjamin Clow back in Wanganui from Victoria University and Benjamin agreed to play the role.</p>
<p>Benjamin's been studying English and History leaving little time to pursue his interest in theatre. He found following his interest in ballroom dancing too expensive in the capital. He spent five years dancing at the Glastonbury Studio before moving to Wellington. He's pleased that he has the opportunity to dance in&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>. Although he enjoyed being involved in Wanganui High School's production of&nbsp;<em>Annie</em>&nbsp;in 2015 he didn't get to dance. He was President Roosevelt so he spent his stage time in a wheelchair!</p>
<p>"I'm really excited to be acting at Repertory Theatre. It's my first time here and I really like the character I'm playing. He's a clumsy nerd with a good heart and he gets the girl in the end," he said.</p>
<p>We're lucky to have both Bee and Benjamin. Hopefully these two talented youngsters will enjoy their association with us so much that they will continue 'treading the boards' on Ridgway St.</p>
<p>Performances 6.30pm December Fri 9, Wed 14, Thurs 15 and Fri 16. <br />Matinees 2pm Sat 10, Sun 11, Sat 17 and Sun 18.</p>
