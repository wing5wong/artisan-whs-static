We said farewell to nine of our international students; Minato, Ryoji, Jumpei, Kaiesei, Yuki and Hibiki from Japan and Lilli, Lea and Flemming [](<>)from Germany. It has been wonderful having you as international students at Whanganui High School. We hope you take some fond memories home and return to visit us some time in the future. Thank you to Mr Ding for providing the karaoke entertainment.
