<p><strong>A big congratulations to Emma Rainey, Y11 student at WHS who has made the NZ Junior Hockey Squad.</strong></p>
<p>Below is information on how she got there and the pathway it leads too. Well done Emma!</p>
<p>Earlier in the year Emma Rainey trialed and got into the central districts under 18 girls hockey team. She played in a national tournament for central districts in early July. She has now been selected as a member of the NZ Juniors along with three other members of the CD team. This is a squad<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;of 38 who go into a training camp in Auckland from 4th to 7th December where they practice skills and play trial games against each other. From this a team of 18 will be selected to go to the Gold Coast for the Junior series against Australia under 19's from 9th &ndash; 14th January 2016.</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This is the start of an amazing pathway for Emma as the next levels up are the future Black Sticks which is essentially under 21's, then the Black Sticks development squad then the Black Sticks themselves.</span></p>
