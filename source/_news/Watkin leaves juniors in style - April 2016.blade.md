<p><span><strong>CLASS ACT: Wanganui High School Year 13 student Jessica Watkin</strong> with professional Ben Smith at her side as she <strong>claimed her fourth successive Junior Cricketer of the Year title.</strong></span></p>
<p>THE LIMELIGHT shone brightly on the juniors at the 2016 Cricket Wanganui awards dinner at Belmont last weekend with several notable team and individual achievements recognised.</p>
<p><strong>Seventeen-year-old Wanganui High School Year 13 student Jessica Watkin was again awarded the overall Junior Cricketer of the Year title for the fourth year in succession.</strong> This was the final time Watkin will receive the Junior of the Year title as she approaches senior age. Watkin plans to leave school at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Watkin almost made a clean sweep of the award categories claiming the most runs, most wickets and the most valuable player titles in the women's section, although over the years she has played in the boys grade through the age groups. She has also played in boys teams for Tech and Wanganui High School at club level when not on women's representative duty.</p>
<p>The award was in recognition of Watkin's massive achievements this season.</p>
<p>Watkin is an integral part of the Wanganui womens rep team, was Central Districts U21 captain, played for the CD Hinds, made the New Zealand A women's XI and has been named in the New Zealand Women's World Cup Squad.</p>
<p>During her brief acceptance speech Watkin gave thanks to all her teammates and coaches that had allowed her to play at boys' level over the years.</p>
<p>Wanganui representative men's coach Stu Gillespie made no bones about the season just gone suggesting fitness and commitment issues played a major part in what was a dismal year.</p>
<p>Tech player Nick Harding was given the award for most wickets in the season in the men's grade, while Chris Sharrock (former WHS student) racked up the most runs.</p>
