Boys Volleyball at Nationals 

‚Äú Day one:

We came away with 2 losses against One Tree Hill College and Garin College Boys A, putting us down in Division 6.

Day two looked like a better day with our first win against Katikati  College. Unfortunately in our second game of the day we came away with a loss losing in a close 3 setter match against Freyberg. 

The boys are still in good Spirits going into our day 3, ready to play Te Paepae O Aotea ‚Äù ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèΩ
