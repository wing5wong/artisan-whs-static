On Friday 16 October, WHS took a team of students to the Central/Lower North Island Tough Guy/Gal Competition held at Camp Wainui, just out of Wellington. 

With no Covid restrictions over 700 students took on the toughest course in the North Island. 

There was a 6 km and 12 km course. 

Our students did the 12 km course. It was a tough course, which the students completed 2 laps of running up hills, through rivers, muddy swamps, up cargo nets and under electric fences. 

**The team did well with Connor Hoskin placing 2nd (Senior Boys) Chase Morpeth 2nd (Junior Boys), Charlotte Baker 2nd and Maggie Jones 3rd (Senior Girls).** 

Important to note that the adult event took place a day later, and going off the adultâ€™s time over the same course, our Connor and Charlotte would have had the same placing.
