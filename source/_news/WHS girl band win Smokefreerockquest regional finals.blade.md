<h3><strong>All girl four piece Straight Lace from Whanganui High School took out the Whanganui regional final of Smokefreerockquest in front of a crowd of over 200 at Whanganui Opera House on Saturday night.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Vocalist Sasha Matthews said the win for the Year 11 band may have been down to their confidence on stage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We had a strong energy on stage,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We were really put together and clean and we put in a lot of effort. We were nervous at the start but got really excited as we got into it. We were confident in what we did and we gave our all.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The other members of Straight Lace are Imogen Eastgate (drums), Sophie Brooke (keys), Tane Venter (bass) and Nanea Schurhammer (guitar).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brimstone from Whanganui High School placed second; the band members are Maia Falkner (guitar and vocals), Victoria Whibley (bass) Jonathan Stolk (drums).</strong></p>
<p><strong>17 year old Madie (Madison Eades) from Whanganui High School took out the solo duo category with her &ldquo;jazzy soul&rdquo; sound.</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to do something different on stage this year,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was really nervous as I was using a looping pedal and I have never performed with one before. I was relieved when I came off stage that it all went well and I didn&rsquo;t muck up. It was a huge adrenaline rush and I was literally shaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xavia (Xavia Steedman-Wills) from Ruapehu College was placed second in the solo duo category.</p>
