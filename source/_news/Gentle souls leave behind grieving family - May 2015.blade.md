<p><span>MUCH LOVED: Zane and Jennifer Town, who were killed in a car crash on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>Jennifer and Zane Town were gentle souls with a deep love for all children.</p>
<p>That's how Michael Peck, Jennifer's brother and Zane's uncle, remembers his two family members who were killed in a car accident on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jennifer, 41, and Zane, 14, along with three other family members were travelling along SH3 north of Bulls, on their way back from Palmerston North, when the accident happened.</p>
<p>Judy Redfearn, 68, of Palmerston North, who was in another car, was also killed.</p>
<p>The three other family members - Jennifer's son Hayden, daughter Rachel and grandson Lucas - were injured in the crash. Mr Peck said they were recovering well, with the last one due to be discharged from Palmerston North Hospital this week.</p>
<p>But the whole family is grieving deeply, Mr Peck said.</p>
<p>His sister was a wife and mother of four, and worked as an in-home child carer.</p>
<p>"She had three or four little children that she looked after in her home. I had the opportunity to see her with them and she was so loving with them.</p>
<p>"All she ever wanted to do was have children and look after children."</p>
<p>Zane, a Wanganui High School student, had inherited his mother's gift with children.</p>
<p>"It was touching to see him with his siblings and his nephew - he was very gentle and kind, he always had time for them."</p>
<p>Zane was a keen karter and Mr Peck said he understood the family had been in Palmerston North for Zane to do some training.</p>
<p>A family friend, Sheila Schmidt, said the Towns had previously lived in Hawke's Bay and moved to Wanganui when William Town, got a job as a tanker truck driver. She said Mr Town had come upon the scene of the crash by chance while driving a truck on Saturday.</p>
<p>"He was driving a tanker and went past the accident and suddenly realised it was his wife," Ms Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Mr Peck said the family had been overwhelmed with support from the Wanganui community.</p>
<p>"It has deeply touched us."</p>
<p>It was the worst weekend on New Zealand roads for 30 years, with 10 people killed in crashes throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mr Peck said he was grieving for Jennifer and Zane but also for the other eight people who had been killed.</p>
<p>"I heard about my sister and my nephew on Saturday evening, and when I drove down from my home in Katikati I was held up because of another awful accident in Tauranga."</p>
<p>That crash claimed three lives - all female members of one extended family.</p>
