<p>Whanganui High School is celebrating a bumper crop of New Zealand scholarship winners.</p>
<p>Nine Year 13 students and one Year 12 student from 2016 won 24 scholarships between them. The students were invited to the school for a special morning tea with staff and principal Martin McAllen.</p>
<p>Mr McAllen said the school had done particularly well for scholarships in 2016.</p>
<p>"The school usually gets between 16 and about 22 scholarships a year, so we have very strong numbers this year."</p>
<p>He said it was great for the students - who all receive a certain amount of money per subject - but also for the teachers who worked with the students.</p>
<p>Approximately 3 per cent of New Zealand Year 13 students are awarded a scholarship.</p>
<p>Many of the students won more than one scholarship. Gabrielle Penn won the most scholarships with a total of five, in media studies, history, statistics, geography and English.</p>
<p>Miss Penn won an outstanding scholarship in English, making her one of the top students for that subject in the country.</p>
<p>Miss Penn said she had been hoping for a good result.</p>
<p>"I worked very hard so I was hoping to do well. But it was still a very pleasant surprise."</p>
<p>Her collection of scholarships will bring her $15,000 over three years, which she will use to help fund her studies at the University of Auckland. She plans to study law and commerce. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"In the long-term I'd like to be a lawyer or maybe a business consultant," Miss Penn said.</p>
<p>She said it was lovely to come back to the school for morning tea.</p>
<p>"I've caught up with some old classmates and the teachers who helped me a lot last year," Miss Penn said.</p>
<p>Mr McAllen said most of the scholarship students would be leaving Whanganui soon to go to university; but he encouraged them to visit the school whenever they returned to Whanganui.</p>
<p>"We like to maintain those connections with the students, and of course they are an encouragement to our current students," he said.</p>
