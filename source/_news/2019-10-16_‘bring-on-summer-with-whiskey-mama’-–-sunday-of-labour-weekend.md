**Popular local band, ‘Whiskey Mama’ supported by two Whanganui High School Bands, will be playing at Caroline’s Boat Shed on Somme Parade on Sunday, October 27 – the Sunday of Labour weekend.**

Fred Loveridge of Whiskey Mama says, “We bring along our fully equipped truck, park in the car park, open up the stage and play.” They have played at Caroline’s before and the patrons and concert goers love the chance to sit back, relax and listen to the music while ordering drinks and meals. There is no entry charge.

**The two High School bands are:  
• Ocean Loaf.** They do their own material and covers and Fred describes their music as mainly ‘Indie Pop.’  
**• Rhythm Vision.** They also play mainly their own material, written by guitarist Dan Godwin. Their style is ‘Prog (progressive) Rock.’*

Whiskey Mama play Classic Rock covering everything from the Pretenders through to Deep Purple. As Fred says, “We have diverse song choices.” They have been together for a couple of years although as individuals, the five band members have been performing for a long time.

Fred says, “We really enjoy playing together and most weekends we are out somewhere.” This includes up to Auckland and down to Christchurch. They are especially popular in Taranaki to the point “we could describe ourselves as a Taranaki band.” They will be doing a combined trip soon with a gig in New Plymouth on a Friday night from 5pm to 9.30pm and another in Tauranga on the Sunday for a 50th Motor Cycle club celebration in Tauranga for another four hour stint.

**‘Bring on Summer’ concert is from 2pm through to around 6.30pm.**
