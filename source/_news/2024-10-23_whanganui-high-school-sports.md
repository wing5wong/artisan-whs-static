Great afternoon for some of our rowing squad to meet and listen to our homegrown rowing olympians Jackie Gowler and Kerri Williams. 

They even bought their Olympic medals along for the rowers to see. 

Bronze Medalist at the Paris Olympics 🥉🥉

💚💛🖤🖤

Both Jackie and Kerri rowed out of Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club ❤️💛
