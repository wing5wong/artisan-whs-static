<p><span>FIZZING: The Wanganui netball girls were buzzing despite a thrashing from a North Harbour side loaded with Silver Ferns and Mystics at the National Championships in Wellington. All smiles with several of their foes are Te Atawhai McDonnell, (left), <strong>Eleanor Hogan (former WHS), Renee Butler (WHS),</strong> Sophie Collins, Malia Paskea (North Harbour), <strong>Suzeanne Guilford (former WHS),</strong>&nbsp;Temalisi Fakahokotau (North Harbour), Loni Martin, Phoenix Karaka (North Harbour), Karaihi Peina, <strong>Hayley Addenbrooke (former WHS), Sam Murphy (WHS)&nbsp;and Kelera Kuruyabaki (former WHS).</strong></span></p>
<p>THE Wanganui representative netball girls were simply buzzing yesterday despite receiving an 81-28 hiding from North Harbour at the 2105 Lion Foundation National Championships in Wellington.</p>
<p>The North Harbour side featured three Silver Ferns and was otherwise loaded with Mystics players, including its latest signing, 2m-tall Megan Craig.</p>
<p>Wanganui coach Lisa Murphy said her girls were buzzing just being able to play against Silver Ferns and players at national franchise level.</p>
<p>On Monday, in its first national championship for 15 years, Wanganui was beaten by Dunedin 73-41 before beating Hutt Valley 50-43. They were to play Hawke's Bay last night in a game to determine third in pool B.</p>
<p>"We fully expected to be beaten by both Dunedin and North Harbour, but targeted Hutt Valley and Hawke's Bay as beatable. We have already claimed Hutt Valley and now we're focusing on Hawkes Bay tonight," Murphy said yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>"Teams like North Harbour and Dunedin play at a far higher level and our girls were trying to adjust to the different pace. North Harbour has three Ferns - Phoenix Karaka, Temalisi Fakahokotau and Malia Paskea and then there was former basketballer Megan Craig.</p>
<p>"Teams like these are just beautiful to watch, but in saying that we had some good passages of play go our way."</p>
<p>Wanganui has more games today, with rivals determined by last night's results.</p>
