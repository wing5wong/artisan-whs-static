<p><strong>Central Football takes on 2017 M Sports Cup</strong></p>
<p><span><span>The 2017 M Sports Cup held in Sydney, Australia took place over July 10 &ndash; 14. A select group of Central Football&rsquo;s 13th-grade boys and 14th-grade girls took part in this event for the second consecutive year. The event hosted some of Australia&rsquo;s and New Zealand&rsquo;s best talent, with the likes of professional A League and W League Club Academies.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The group arrived in Sydney late Sunday evening. Monday morning kick started the M Sports Cup with the boys drawing in their first game and then returning later in the afternoon to capture a win over NSW County 0-4. While the boys were celebrating their victory, the girls took to the sites of Sydney for the day, exploring the city via jet boating, tours up the Sydney Tower Eye and shopping. The boys would partake in the same activities on Thursday while the girls competed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Tuesday the girls made their debut against the Blacktown Spartans where they lost 0-1. They came back later that afternoon to claim a victory over Illawara Stingrays with a win 1-0. The girls would go on to play the Macarthur Rams and finish with an exciting win in overtime, over the Emerging Jetts 2-1, to place 5</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;at the M Sports Cup.</span></span></p>
<p>FDO Aleesha Heywood spoke on the recent trip to Sydney, pointing out that it was the first time for many of the girls to compete outside of New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was great for the girls to gain experience with overseas competition. They did well on and off the field and it was really an excellent way to finish off their season.&rdquo;</p>
