<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's stuck up, really snobby and at the same time she's really stupid, the biggest flirt you'll ever see. She just flirts to get what she wants," says Brie Parkinson, who plays the part of Paris Stilton in Repertory Theatre's production of&nbsp;<em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Does her mother spoil her?" I asked.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"No! Her mother's just interested in her money. All her mother wants is to get more money for herself," replies Brie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brie's really enjoying the role of Paris Stilton. "When she says stupid things it's so funny."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She's drawing on her 10 years plus of dancing (modern ballet, jazz ballet, hip-hop and contemporary dance) to choreograph her own dance for the panto and enjoying the challenge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yes, I did dance and drama all through school. I've been on stage since I was five years old. My first play was&nbsp;<em>The Ugly Bug Ball</em>&nbsp;at St Johns Hill School. I was in&nbsp;<em>Lunch Box Blues</em>too."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brie stage managed several recent Repertory productions as well. This recent school leaver has been kept quite busy in theatre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Benjamin Clow, who's playing Jack is also a busy young person, having just finished his second year at Victoria University where he's studying towards a Bachelor of Arts degree.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's lazy, a fantasist, a dreamer," he says of Jack. "The best parts of his role are his interactions with other characters like his mother and Paris. It's always fun working with Colin. He doesn't over-direct, letting the acting come from the actor."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Having studied drama throughout his high school years with director Colin Hedivan, Benjamin knows him well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was Dopey the Dwarf in&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tale High</em>&nbsp;when I was in junior high and I wore a tunic. Everyone said it was a dress because it was too long and I kept tripping over it. I'm going to the UK on December 31 on a student exchange programme. I'll be studying at the Royal Holloway University in Surrey, which is a pretty posh county," smiled Ben.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He's looking forward to the experience just as he's obviously having a romp in the panto.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The show will run through to Saturday, December 23. To accommodate younger children evening performances will begin at 6.30pm with matinees at 1.30pm.</p>
