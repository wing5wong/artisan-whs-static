It is with a heavy heart that we need to tell you that our beloved Tonia Hoobin passed away yesterday after a bravely fought battle with cancer. We will miss her terribly, both as a friend and as a colleague. Tonia was the stalwart of the International Department and had worked here for many, many years. We will really miss her. Our hearts go out to Greg, Reece and Nathan and the rest of her loving family. 

If you are in New Zealand and would like to join us and her family in celebrating her extraordinary life, there will be a service at Cleveland's Funeral Home on Monday at 1pm. As per Tonia's wishes, everyone should wear bright colours to brighten the day.

Thank you, Tonia, for the love and laughter you brought to our international family.
