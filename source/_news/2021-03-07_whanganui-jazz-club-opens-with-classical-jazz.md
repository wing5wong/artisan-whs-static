The first show of the 2021 season features a group of Whanganui musicians playing jazz from the classic jazz repertoire. Patron of the club, Angela Crawford, has been promoting and playing this music for years here in town. In the true jazz tradition, she continues to bring musicians together to interpret jazz and blues standards that have stood the test of time. 

The band features a solid rhythm section with young **Chester Nevil** behind the drum kit, Roger Brassel on bass and Sam McRae on guitar working with Angela’s electric piano. Two of the vocalists have featured regularly with Angela’s bands – Denise McNeil and Ash Mayor. And new to the group is Brian Omundsun who plays tenor saxophone and also adds vocals. 

This will be a relaxed evening of easy listening jazz and blues standards to get the season started, and you can expect a surprise or two. Mostly, it will be a time to meet up with old friends and for anyone new to the club, a chance to meet and hear from the people who have been keeping jazz alive here in Whanganui.

Custom is for the Jazz Club to hold its AGM prior to this, the first Club Night of the year. Anyone with an interest in joining the committee is invited to attend by coming to the St Johns Club, 158 Glasgow Street at 4:30pm on Sunday, 7 March.  The music follows at 6:30pm.  
General Admission is $25, members pay $15. Memberships are available at the door.

Please be advised that we will meet ONLY IF Whanganui returns to Alert Level One.
