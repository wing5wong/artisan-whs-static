<p><strong>MORE GOLD: Keightley (WHS student) and Callaghan Watson with their medals from Queensland.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE WATSON brothers of the Wanganui Judo Club continued their success across the Tasman with gold medals at the international open tournament in Queensland at the weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Heading to Tallebudgera, which is on the Gold Coast's Palm Beach, 14-year-old Keightley Watson entered the Oceania Cup International Queensland tournament while Callaghan Watson, 10, competed in the Queensland Open International.</p>
<p>Both won gold - Keightley claiming his medal in the cadets +90kg division despite having suffered two broken toes only five days before.</p>
<p>Callaghan Watson took out the +50kg division.</p>
<p>It backs up their results from the ACT International in Canberra a fortnight ago, winning gold and silver respectively.</p>
<p>Father Ross Watson said Keightley also got to attend a two hour training seminar after the event with former Japanese fighter Koji Kumoro, the respected judoka who was won a number of international Grand Prix tournaments.</p>
<p>"That experience alone was beneficial - to be learning from someone of his experience."</p>
<p>The Watsons are continuing preparations for the 2016 Sydney International in September.</p>
