<p>Review by Aaron Potaka</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Forget magic beans, a land of giants and consummated love.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Children in the audience will be familiar to some degree with the motifs of economic recession Mr Hall has crow-barred into the&nbsp;<em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>&nbsp;story: child poverty, debt loading, asset sales, substance abuse, poor nutrition, inter-generational unemployment, financial illiteracy and socio-economic crime.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This story morphs into an alternative panto universe of a lazy, do-nothing, good-for-nothing, thieving, unemployed, young anti-hero on the WINZ benefit, and his rent-shirking mother getting lucky with a goose.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Benjamin Clow as the slacker Jack, and Chris McKenzie as his widowed mother (and with a quick change of hat and accent, market stallholder and vendor of magic beans, Aunty Pam) carry this play with vigour.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The interaction between them and the audience, the essence of pantomime, would have pleased director Colin Hedivan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Speculative investor, the landlady Mrs Stilton (Hilary Cowan) and her repo-man Claude Back (Ronan Shaw) become the villains of the piece in the eyes of the audience, for demanding late rent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brie Parkinson plays blonde gold-digging Paris Stilton, daughter to the landlady, and is Jack's love interest (while a golden goose egg is hers).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ted Charlton is the busiest actor with the roles of Butcher Bob, the immigration officer, and as the voice of the unseen giant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Costuming by Linda Hardcastle accentuates the characters' standing in life &ndash; a mix-and-patch of rags and recycling for the (very) poor, bling and ostentation for the gentrified rich, and good sturdy shoes and working attire for the tradies.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Betsy the Cow (Ashlyn Morris) is the most fashionably dressed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Overall, the play is a highly-charged polemic, but stirring musical knees-ups, including&nbsp;<em>Pantomime Whirl</em>&nbsp;giving dog-whistle politics some ground cover.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Jack and the Beanstalk: Repertory Theatre, Ridgway St, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, December 20-22, 6.30pm; Saturday, December 23, 1.30pm and 6.30pm. Adult $20, senior $18, student $15, child under 15 $10.</strong></p>
