There’s an exhibition on this month at Cooks Gallery in which Arts Society members promote themselves and their group by exhibiting art at very reasonable prices.

They’ve called it Affordable Art. About 30 of the members – the society has about 80 members – have donated works, the proceeds of which will go to the society. Quite a few have been sold already.

It’s also an opportunity for the public to see the facilities of the building near Cooks Gardens (off Trafalgar Place between Wanganui Motors and Holdaways).

So far, as well as the Arts Society, it is used by the Philatelic Society, a tai chi class, a drumming group and the Ornithological Society (bird watchers).

As well as affordable art, there are displays by those groups on Saturday from 10am to 2pm and on Monday 10am to midday. An art group will also be working during those times.

“We need more people to use the facility,” says **Judy Webby** (former WHS Art teacher), Arts Society committee member.

There is the main gallery, which can be used as a workspace, a small, well equipped kitchen with plenty of cupboard space, and a furnished back room, suitable for meetings.

“In Heritage Month, we will be starting on October 3 with another display. There’ll be vintage clothing, someone doing needlework, someone carving, lace making, there might be someone spinning and there will be members painting,” says Judy.
