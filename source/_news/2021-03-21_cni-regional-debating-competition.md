Over the weekend of the 13 and 14 March, Whanganui High School hosted the Central North Island Regional Debating Competition, which was officially opened by our local MP, Steph Lewis. 

Approximately 60 students from six schools participated from around the region. There were five rounds of debating, culminating in a junior and senior final. 

The Whanganui High School teams performed well and the Year 10 team of Bazil Sanderson, Finnian Sinclair and Ivan Adams made it into the junior final, coming runner up to Hawera High School. 

**Alice Quigley**, a Year 10 student, was recognized at the end of the weekend for her performance, being awarded **Most Promising Speaker, Best Junior Speaker and a reserve in the Central North Island Regional Team**. This was an amazing performance and she will gain valuable experience training with this team. 

It was a successful weekend, enjoyed by all who attended.
