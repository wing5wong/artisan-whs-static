Whanganui Walls Street Art Festival started in 2019 and was to continue last year but Covid stopped that. Organisers, Shanti Sibbing and Simon Ormerod say, “We were up until early hours of the morning advising international artists. One Australian artist had already arrived as had our videographer from Japan. Artists from France and the USA were on their way to the airport.”

This won’t be an issue for 2021 because all seven artists are based in New Zealand. Two are from Whanganui – Dan Mills and Mike Marsh. Simon is also a mural artist but says, “I prefer not to over saturate murals with too many of my murals in any one place,” so he will not be participating as an artist this year. “All artists taking part are experienced, professional artists.” The event takes place from March 18 to 21.

Simon explains, “A lot has changed in public mural art over the last 15 years. The artists will bring their own unique styles and techniques.” 

There is also a youth art mural to take place with eight aspiring artists selected from UCOL and local secondary schools – **Whanganui High School (Imogen Maguire, Rose Hird and Freyja Wrigglesworth)**, Whanganui Girls’ College and from Te Kura A Iwi O Kokohuia. Shanti explains, “The mural will be off Drews Ave at the back of Embassy 3,” and Simon adds, “We were blown away by the high standard of artwork the young artists sent to us.” 

All of the seven murals will be painted on new sites. Check their Facebook page to find out where. Shanti says, “The public are encouraged to watch. Each artist has a ‘spotter’ for health and safety reasons but also for answering questions from the public. This also takes pressure off the artists.”

There will be a free music festival on the Saturday of the event. This will take place at Majestic Square. Co-ordinator, Charlotte Melser says, “There will be seven acts all stellar and eclectic.” The day’s headliner will be ‘Pluto.’ Charlotte says, “They were huge in the 2000s and have made a great contribution to New Zealand music especially rock music.” Of particular interest is that Pluto includes local drummer, Michael Franklin-Browne.  

Another group is the 10 piece Hip Hop group called ‘Raw Collective,’ from Wellington. The music will be from 1.30pm through to 10pm. It will also be a great chance to view the mural painting on the second to last day, returning to enjoy the music.
There will be food and beverages at the site and Charlotte recommends you bring both sunscreen and your dancing shoes.

Major funding partners are Whanganui Town Centre Regeneration, Whanganui & Partners, the District Council and Creative NZ. Resene and Harrisons Hire Master are in-kind sponsors, plus many local businesses are supporting the event.
