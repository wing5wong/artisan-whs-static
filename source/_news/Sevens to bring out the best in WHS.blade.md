<p><span>Whanganui High School sports teams will be out to make a little bit of history as they attend national schools tournaments over the next two weekends.</span></p>
<p>WHS's girls sevens have made the iconic Condor Sevens tournament for the first time, which has been moved to Auckland's Sacred Heart College as the event has swelled to 96 teams in open boys and girls grades, as well as Under 15's.</p>
<p>The team is being coached by Pirates' stalwart and former Wanganui and Samoan representative Denning Tyrell.</p>
<p>WHS sports co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said Tyrell is delighted the side will have the opportunity to test themselves against some of the best rugby schools in the country.</p>
<p>"We have some talented girls in Wanganui and already have had NZ selectors watching Kahurangi Sturmey and De Ann Tyrell at the Central Regional 7's in Marton last weekend."</p>
<p>It will be a big couple of weekend's for WHS's most talented footy players as the school's vaunted Mixed Touch team will be heading up to Papakura next weekend to try and retain their title at the National Secondary School championships.</p>
<p>In addition, the growth of the sport at WHS has see their girls touch team also qualify for nationals.</p>
<p>Last year's team completed a four year journey when they finally won the Mixed title last year, after twice being beaten in the final.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were recognised with the Junior Team award, while their coach Sean Brown shared the Coach of the Year prize at the 2016 Ray White Whanganui Sports Awards two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Brown has been preparing both the Mixed and Girls sides for Papakura.</p>
<p>"We have a strong core of girls coming through from our junior school so it's exciting to see them qualify," he said.</p>

<p>Whanganui students will be all over Auckland as the New Zealand Secondary School Athletics Championships.</p>
<p>Murphy said the WHS programme has continued to go from strength to strength during 2016, with the school's newly formed athletics squad now training on a regular basis.</p>
<p>They have three teams in the junior competition along with the standout senior athletes</p>
<p>"The aim of the squad is to create enjoyment and long term development but with some excellent early season performances in these competitions we now have six athletes heading to Auckland."</p>
<p>Look for Year 9 student Sophie Andrews to continue her growth in hammer and javelin throwing, having broken personal bests in recent weeks and coming third in the women's grade at the Whanganui Regional for hammer.</p>

<p>Rebecca Baker set new school records in the 800m and 1500m track events, while Travis Bayler has improved in the 200m sprint and wiped 21s off his personal best in 800m.</p>
<p>Matt Kleinsmith has performed well in the 100 with another school year ahead, while looking to finish with a flourish will be Year 13's Louis Hogan (long distance runner) and Joseph Redpath (400m, triple jump).</p>
<p>"With all but two of them back next year, plus the combination of the new talent that has been on show in the team's competition and a new group of Year 9's. the rest of the season looks very bright indeed," said Murphy.</p>
