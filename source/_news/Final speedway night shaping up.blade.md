<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />It's the end of the season at Fast Lane Spares Oceanview Family Speedway tomorrow evening, but don't expect the speedway fraternity to go quietly into the night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Instead, there's an explosive nights action planned both on the track, and in the air above.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Topping the speedway bill is the West Coast Superstocks Championship, which had drawn a classy field.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leading the challenge will be current 2NZ Peter Rees, one of the best drivers of his generation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A five-time New Zealand Stockcar champion, Rees also won the Superstock title at Wellington four seasons ago.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another former 1NZ in the field is Jared Wade, who won the title as a 20-year-old. After a break from racing, Wade has returned to the sport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Joining them is Graeme Barr, who has been on the NZ Superstocks podium four times in a long career.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At the other end of the scale, a new generation is emerging in the sport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ethan Rees, son of Peter, and Rebecca Barr, daughter of Graeme, are both highly talented drivers in their own right.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rees is a former 1NZ in the Stockcar class, whilst Barr made history in February when she became the first female to compete at the ENZED Superstock Teams Champs in Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Barr took second place in last season's West Coast Superstocks, and would love to go one better tomorrow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other drivers to watch in the field include World 240's champion Benji Sneddon, David Lowe, Darrell Wallace and rookie Will Hart.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Visiting drivers will face one of the strongest local contingents in recent years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Veteran Kerry Podjursky is a two-time West Coast champion, while Shaun Smith, former WHS student Max Holloway and Carl Burns have all been in good form, and Scott Duncan will be hoping to end a run of mechanical issues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each of the 12-lap Superstock heats will also serve as a memorial race, in memory of the late Noel Kensington, George Podjursky and Craig Heibner respectively.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The West Coast Sidecars has attracted a field of 15 bikes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Local brothers Aaron and Bryce Rose will face stern competition from the likes of Russell Stuart/Andrew Parker, Mark Whye/Jacob Cooper and Glen Murray/Ann Plummer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A big field of Production Saloons will also be on hand for their West Coast title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brent Hackett won the Ray Purdy Memorial at the last meeting, but he will face a stiff challenge from defending West Coast champion Grant Loveridge, who now runs out of Rotorua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rounding out the programme are the Heiby Memorial Youth Ministocks, Stockcars and Adult Ministocks, before the racing will end with the Gourmet Express Demolition Derby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And the night sky above Oceanview will then light up as the Kairanga Lions set off a spectacular volley of fireworks to add to the family fun.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The gates at Oceanview will open at 4pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Additional parking is being provided opposite the main entrance, and there will be plenty of hot food and drinks available onsite.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's been a very successful season for the Wanganui Stockcar and Speedway Club. All that remains now is to end it with a bang.</p>
