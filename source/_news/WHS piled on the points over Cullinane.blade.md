<p><span>Whanganui High School goal shoot Montel Vaiao Aki piled on the points in Monday s win over Cullinane College.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A solid defensive effort underpinned Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau's convincing win over Mere Te Aroha when premier one netball resumed on Monday evening.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The two-week gap for school holiday rep tournaments had done nothing to blunt Kaierau's edge as Netball Whanganui's defending champions continued their unbeaten season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaierau coach Walter Edmonds was delighted to clear his bench and give every player court time in the 61-36 victory.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was pleased with the defensive work across the court which laid the foundations, while up front, goal shoot Susan Guilford continued her consistent form this season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Second-placed Phillips Electrical Whanganui High School went into their game against Cullinane College on something of a high, with six of the squad having been part of the under-17 rep team that came a magnificent seventh in last week's New Zealand Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">High School came home 61-35 in a fairly one-sided game that saw the Cullinane players have to do the hard yards with just seven players turning out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In contrast, High School coach Lisa Murphy was able to use all her 10-player squad and had the luxury of trying a few different combinations as the game wore on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Montel Vaiao Aki was again racking up the goals as she led the WHS attack, ably aided by goal attack Imogen Flower, while goal keep Kara Adrole proved a formidable obstacle for the Cullinane spearhead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The third match saw Kaiwhaiki sweep aside Mint Caf&eacute; Marist, the 71-39 scoreline keeping Kaiwhaiki firmly in third spot, and Marist in fourth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are three more round-robin games before the playoffs, and Mere Te Aroha and Cullinane have their work cut out to get into that top four and extend their seasons.</p>
