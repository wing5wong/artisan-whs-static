Whanganui High School, Whanganui Girls' College and Cullinane College co-hosted a group of 15 students from our sister-city, Nagaizumi-cho, Japan, this week. Although short, their visit was fulfilled with various school-based activities and tours of local attractions.

A big thank you to our dedicated staff, school buddies and homestay families for making the students' stay memorable. We also want to acknowledge Whanganui District Council, Whanganui and Partners and Weir Tours [](<>)for the coordination of the visit.
