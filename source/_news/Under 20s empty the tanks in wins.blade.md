<p class="element element-paragraph">The Air Chathams Wanganui Under 20's proved you have to play every second of the 80 minutes as they retained the Hurricanes Development Series trophy by winning two thrillers in Palmerston North at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Having narrowly held off Poverty Bay 30-28 in the first game in Gisborne the previous week, Wanganui squeezed past fellow title contender Wairarapa-Bush 27-24 on Saturday, then had to come from behind inside the last 10 minutes to beat Horowhenua-Kapiti 29-17 on Sunday at the Massey University grounds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While they made a three-peat of Hurricanes titles, it was perhaps the hardest campaign of the lot with the other provinces being improved, which meant Wanganui required a lot of composure in the dying minutes of each match.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was the pleasing thing, in the three games," said coach Jerome McCrea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"All the games were won in the 70-something minute.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I told them it's an 80 minute game - at times we were struggling a bit, but they came through all three games."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Against Wairarapa-Bush, the tryscorers were lock Hamish Bennett, centre Junior Ainea, fullback Shaquille Waara and hooker Dylan Gallien, with first-five <strong>Mitchell Millar</strong> (former WHS student) adding two conversions and a penalty.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was to and fro," said McCrea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"[Wairarapa-Bush] were very good as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui's title aspirations appeared to be derailing on Sunday, as they trailed Horowhenua-Kapiti 17-12 with the clock running down.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They went really flat, really quiet, for 25 minutes, just sort of waiting for someone to spark something," said McCrea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui recovered to score three tries inside the last ten minutes to retain the trophy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bennett and Ainea were again tryscorers, along with flanker Dale Akuhata and both wingers - Harry Symes and Luke Foster - with <strong>Millar</strong> adding two conversions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Halfback<strong> Cameron Davies</strong> was then named the Player of the Development Series Cup for being very consistent behind the base of the scrum.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The honours kept coming as ten members of the squad were named in the new Hurricanes Heartland Under 20 team - the most out of the five unions with seven coming from Wairarapa-Bush, four from Horowhenua-Kapiti and one each from Poverty Bay and East Coast</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Davies</strong>, Bennett, Symes, Gallien, Ainea, <strong>Chris Breuer, Dylan Bowater, Ethan Robinson</strong>, Blade Jones, and <strong>Shaquille McKay</strong> were all originally selected.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, Ainea is returning to Samoa so his team mate Waara, initially named as a stand-by player, was called in to replace him.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was awesome, getting that many guys in from our union," said McCrea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Those boys, they'll learn a lot in those three weeks with coaching and development."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hurricanes Heartland will be coached by the franchise's development officer Darren Larsen and managed by Wanganui rugby's Lesley McKenzie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Starting this weekend, they will play in the Central Region Shield tournament against the Under 19 teams from Hawke's Bay, Manawatu and Wellington.</p>
