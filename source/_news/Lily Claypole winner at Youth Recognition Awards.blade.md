<p><strong>Lily Claypole, winner of the WDC Youth Committee Youth Recognition Award with her video work&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/166439157186971/videos/350118042152414/"><em>"Through a Glass Darkly"</em></a></strong></p>
<p><span>Tauranga Art Gallery Director Karl Chitham, who judged this year&rsquo;s Whanganui Arts Review, said &ldquo;the simple gesture of lighting a face behind a textured glass pane is hard to do well but this artist has used a considered eye to linger and move on at just the right times &ndash; creating suspense and the sense of a narrative.&rdquo;</span><br /><a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/whanganuiartsreview" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:104}">#whanganuiartsreview</a></p>
