<p class="element element-paragraph">Brass Whanganui has returned from the New Zealand Brass Band Championships in Blenheim with nine trophies and the shield for best B Grade band in the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have had the most marvellous time. The band has been incredible in the way they have gone about it. It's pretty cool when it all comes together," musical director Bruce Jellyman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 138th championships were on from July 11-15, and a contingent of 30 Whanganui band members and five managers went.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brass Whanganui has alternated between the A and B grades, and was in a rebuilding phase after losing some key players.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Members were surprised and delighted to clamber back to the top of the B Grade, Jellyman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They didn't know how well they had done until results were announced on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The first few days of the event were for solo and small group competition.</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's Sarah Wright&nbsp;(WHS student) was junior cornet champion and went on to be second junior overall.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Hamish Jellyman and Ian O'Malley (ex WHS student) won the open duet, band chairman Jonathon Greenwell (ex WHS student)&nbsp;was third in the open bass trombone and the trombone trio came second.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Friday was a "momentous" day for the band. It won the sacred item and test major work categories, with Andrew Toy on flugelhorn the best soloist in the test work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the street march it won three trophies and was second across all the bands. It adopted a theme based on the 1960s television show&nbsp;<em>Thunderbirds</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Band members dressed in bright red and marched in the shape of a rocket ship, with band manager Kaye Smith dressed as Lady Penelope in the lead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They had a good sound, were well drilled and were also judged the most entertaining.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Saturday was the day for playing longer pieces. Brass Whanganui was fourth in the B Grade, but with the points from Friday it was judged best B Grade band overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All the band's new trophies will live in a cabinet in its bandroom, and Brass Whanganui will be New Zealand's best B Grade band for the next 12 months.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The last time it achieved that was 2010, Jellyman said, and he hadn't expected it this time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We thought it would be nice to get a placing - there are some good bands in that grade. We've just gone and whipped them."</p>
