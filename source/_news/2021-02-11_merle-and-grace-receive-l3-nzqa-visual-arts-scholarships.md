We love celebrating the successes of our students!  

**Today we want to congratulate Merle Chant (DESIGN) and Grace Swanston (PAINTING) for obtaining Level 3 NZQA Visual Arts scholarships- in support of their EXCELLENCE graded folios.**  

The scholarship is a portfolio presentation of support documentation for their folio boards.

Well done ladies, you should be super proud of yourselves, we are!!!
