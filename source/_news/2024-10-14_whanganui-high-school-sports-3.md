Huge congratulations to Y13 student Teresa Rennie and Y12 student Nevaeh Blake for being selected to attend the NZ U18 & U20 womenâ€™s touch camp in January 2025. 

From there, teams will be selected to represent NZ at the Trans Tasman Tournament in Queensland in May. 

Wishing you both all the best for the camp!
