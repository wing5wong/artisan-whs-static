<p>Hinds captain Kate Broadmore was named Player of the Year for the form which earned a recall to the White Ferns, having scored 608 runs at an average of 67.55, while also taking eight wickets and four catches.</p>
<p>Taranaki's Tom Bruce, who learned his cricket at Wanganui Collegiate, was named Most Improved Player for the Devon Hotel Central Stags after their final Plunket Shield game against Wellington at McLean Park in Napier on Saturday.In seven Plunket Shield games, Bruce scored 632 runs at 57.45, including his maiden first-class hundred and six half-centuries.</p>
