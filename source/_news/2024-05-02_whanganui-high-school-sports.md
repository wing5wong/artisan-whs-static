Congratulations to Jake Newton (Yr12) who was selected in the North Island Squad to compete against the South Island squad in the NZ U18 Camp.

Jake won the single race by 8 seconds, his quad finished 2nd to the South Island on both days.

Jake was the top male sculler at the regatta.

This [](<>)is the first time in 10yrs the North Island squad has won and by a record margin. Well done.
