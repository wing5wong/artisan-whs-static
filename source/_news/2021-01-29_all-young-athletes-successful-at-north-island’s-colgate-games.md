Athletics Wanganui had 5 athletes represent the club at this year’s North Island Colgate Games in Inglewood. This is an annual event and is highly competitive. Athletes can compete from the age of 7 to 14 years with under 10’s competing for pennants from each race and 10 and up competing in age groups through to a final to win a medal in their chosen event.

#### This year’s team and results were:  

• 10 year old boys - Cruz Malo - 2 Golds in 100m and 200m, 9th High Jump, 10th in long jump.  
• 8 year old girls - Harlynn Faalili – Pennants won in the following - 3rd 60m, 2nd in the 100m, 1st in the 200m and 3rd in the long jump.  
• 12 year old boys - Brian Wilson - 4 Golds as Para athlete for 100m, 200m, discus and shotput.  
**• 14 year old girls - Carrie Rennie - 4th in 80m hurdles, just missed qualifying by one place for the 800m final.**   
**• 14 year old girls - Teresa Rennie - 5th in 80m hurdles, 4th in 100m heat, 6th in 200m heat.**

This was Brian’s third Colgate Games but the first for the rest of the Wanganui athletes.

Harlynn and Cruz will be running in the Fastest Kid on the Block finals at this year’s Cooks Classic. 

Thanks to a “very proud grandfather” of Harlynn, Wayne Bishop, who alerted us to the results.  He accompanied his granddaughter to the games over the three days, describing the games as “so well run” with the attraction of having top athletes such as champion pole-vaulter, Eliza McCartney, Rod Waddell, Olympic Gold Medallist and double World Champion Single sculler rower and America's Cup yachtsman as well as  a triple New Zealand Supreme 'Halberg Awards' Sportsperson of the year winner, mixing with the young athletes.
