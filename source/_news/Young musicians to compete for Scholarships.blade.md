<p><span>Young musicians to compete for Scholarships, including WHS student <strong>Ben Power </strong>(left).</span></p>
<p><span>Last year's Intermediate section winners. Three of the students (Ben Power, Rada Punnarujawong - 1st and 2nd from the left and Earth Sunthornyanakit (far right) will be performing again this year.

<p>Each September the IRMT (Institute of Registered Musical Teachers) Wanganui branch runs its major performance competition, the Sonja Wilson Memorial Scholarships, for young musicians of Grade 6 and above. This event was established in 2005 in memory of Sonja Wilson, the IRMT Chairperson for several years and a well-known pianist and teacher in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, the competition has expanded to include further awards and trop<span class="text_exposed_show">hies in memory of local musicians and teachers &ndash; the Nita Oldham Award for the most promising singer, the Clarice Weir Scholarship for most promising string player and, new last year, the Judy Barrett Memorial Cup for &ldquo;outstanding piano performance&rdquo;. Judy Barrett, who passed away early last year, was Chairperson of the Wanganui IRMT. She was a wonderful teacher, accompanist, choral conductor and friend and this cup, honouring her memory, will be presented at the scholarship finals.<br /></span></p>
