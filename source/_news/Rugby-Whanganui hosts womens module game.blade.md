<p>Wanganui Rugby is looking to grow the women's game in the province with initiatives like the module game held at Cooks Gardens on Saturday.<br /><em>Photos / Supplied</em></p>
<p><br />The curtain raiser game to the Game of Three Halves was a special Women's Module match involving players from Whanganui and Manawatu on Saturday.</p>
<p>In an attempt to build the local women's game, the Wanganui Rugby Football Union has plans to raise a team similar to the men's St Johns Club Whanganui Metro, who compete in the Manawatu Colts division.</p>
<p>Development officer Eneliko Fa'atau has been recruiting players, while the keystone is the return home of&nbsp;<strong>Sosoli Talawadua</strong>, the prop with eight caps for the Black Ferns.</p>
<p>The daughter of boxing trainer Eddie Tofa and sister of Steelform Wanganui prop&nbsp;<strong>Viki Tofa</strong>, Talawadua captained Waikato and was part of the successful New Zealand team at the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup in Ireland.</p>
<p>So far, around eight girls are training on Tuesday's and Thursday's, alternating between Whanganui and travelling to Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The game on Saturday at Cooks Gardens involved the Whanganui players appearing in both teams alongside their Manawatu counterparts.</p>
