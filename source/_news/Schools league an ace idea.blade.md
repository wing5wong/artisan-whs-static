<p><span>DOUBLE UP: Whanganui High School students India-Rose Wallace (left) and Holly-Rae Mete team up in the newly-launched Monday evening secondary novice doubles league on home court.</span></p>
<p>Tennis appears to be undergoing somewhat of a resurgence in Whanganui, especially at school level.</p>
<p>Tennis Wanganui in collaboration with Sport Whanganui has launched two new competitions for secondary and primary/intermediate players.</p>
<p>Tennis Wanganui development contractor Gene Ridgway said kids were flocking to the game, especially at secondary school level.</p>
<p>"When we launched the Secondary Novice Doubles League 18 teams from four schools entered taking us a bit by surprise," Ridgway said. The schools include Cullinane, Whanganui High School, Collegiate School and Girls College.</p>
<p>"We thought we'd probably get four or five teams. The secondary competition is played at Whanganui High School and Whanganui Girls College with two grades - the Year 9 to Year 11 for an hour immediately after school followed the Year 12 to Year 13 players.</p>
<p>"They are played every Monday, while the primary/intermediate competition is every Thursdays at Whanganui Intermediate School between St Anne's, Durie Hill, WIS and a mixed team."</p>

<p>Ridgway said the competitions that began last week would continue through until the end of term in four weeks when they would be reviewed.</p>
<p>"We'll talk to the people and let them guide us. We can run competitions every term if the support is there, but we'll certainly run the summer one regardless. There is also scope for the competitions to grow, especially in the primary/intermediate grade, simply by adding time slots and/or courts to the mix," Ridgway said.</p>
