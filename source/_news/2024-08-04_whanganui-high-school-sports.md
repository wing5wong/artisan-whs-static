City Judo Whanganui - success at the Auckland International Open

Over the July 20th—21st weekend, City Judo Whanganui sent a squad to the Auckland International Judo Open, held on Auckland's Eastside. Amidst stiff competition from French Polynesia, the USA, Australia, and New Zealand, their small team of athletes proved that hard work and dedication lead to success. 

The results included:

• Lucas Munn - double gold in the Cadets (under 18s) over 81kg Men's and Cadets Open Men's brackets, while also picking up a silver in the Junior Men's (under 21s) under 90kg bracket. 

• Jaimie Connelly - silver medal in the Cadet Women's under 57kg.

• Noah Frederick - bronze medal in the under 73kg Cadet Men's. 

• Dana Love – gold in the Senior Women's and Kata Competitions, for nage no kata (judo demonstration, partnered with Lucas Munn) and was awarded her shodan grade (black belt) during Sunday's competition.

 Coach Garry Davies says, "This weekend was an excellent warm-up for the  Brisbane International Judo Open and Australian Schools Judo Championships in September, and it showed they are where they need to be to be competitive"

This will be Jaimie, Noah, and Dana's international debut, while Lucas will be attending this competition for the second year running and looking to defend his gold from last year.

Kylie Munn from the club says: “It is through hard work that the athletes compete at these competitions and the generosity of the general public who have supported our fundraising BBQs, and local businesses, Rolling Stone Quarry, Chemwash Cleaning, Wicksteed Medical, Mischief Cafe, Mt View Print and The Mitre 10 Future Champions Trust, who have kindly helped to fund our athletes to help make this trip a reality.”
