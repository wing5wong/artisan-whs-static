<p>National Youth Brass Band 2017 Tour. Two local lads feature in the band - former WHS students Brad and Jacob Mancer, both of whom trained here in Whanganui with Brass Wanganui. Brad will be a feature soloist in the Collegiate concert.</p>
<p>The National Youth Brass Band (NYBB) is a talented group of young brass musicians from all around Aotearoa New Zealand, who will be performing at the Wanganui Collegiate at 7.30pm on Thursday, January 26.</p>
<p>The concert is titled Structured De/Constructed. The programme will feature a mix of classical and modern brass band music. The first half features classical works, including Phillip Wilby's Paganini Variations and Denis Wright's arrangement of Brahms' Academic Festival Overture. The second half is lively and upbeat, featuring modern brass band and jazz music. This is an exciting range of music that will appeal to all ages.</p>
<p>This year the band is under the musical direction of David Bremner, music director of Australasian champion band Wellington Brass and principal trombonist with the NZSO.</p>
<p>The band is an eclectic mix of talented young New Zealanders up to age 22, who perform to an amazingly high standard. They are chosen by audition from applicants all over New Zealand. Their enthusiasm is infectious, making the performance an inspiring and musically satisfying experience.</p>
<p><strong>Two local lads feature in the band - Brad and Jacob Mancer, both of whom trained here in Whanganui with Brass Wanganui. Brad will be a feature soloist in the Collegiate concert.</strong></p>
