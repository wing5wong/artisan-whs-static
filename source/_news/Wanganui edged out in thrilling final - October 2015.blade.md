<p><span>BEST AND FAIREST: The Wanganui Under-16s with their trophy for best sportsmanship at the Hurricanes tournament in Levin.</span></p>
<p>AG Challenge Wanganui Under-16 went toe-to-toe with the favourites of the Hurricanes B competition and went down swinging in a 27-24 thriller with Wellington Development in the final at Levin's Playford Park yesterday morning.</p>
<p>After a stirring prematch haka, of which the video is currently doing the rounds on social media, Wanganui trailed 15-14 at halftime, with the teams then doing tit-for-tat scoring and making every opportunity count - Wellington barely holding the ascendancy 22-19 and then the final scoreline.</p>
<p>Wanganui's Shaiden Daniels scored two tries, while Cody Edwards and loose forward <strong>CJ Church (WHS)</strong> got the others, <strong>Church</strong> adding two conversions.</p>
<p>Daniels finished with six tries from three games.</p>
<p>"They tackled, and the passion and desire to play for each other," said Matt Boult, father of centre Adam Boult.</p>
<p>"They really stood up and played their guts out."</p>
<p>Adam Boult set up two tries and was a standout, along with <strong>Church</strong> and halfback <strong>Griffen Culver (WHS)</strong> - who did a lot of covering work and was the sole member of the squad named in the tournament team.</p>
<p>The efforts of this Wanganui U16 unit must be recognised considering previous incarnations have at times suffered heavy defeats at this tournament, whereas the John Church-coached side comfortably won their pool matches and went so close against the bigger Wellington side, selected from a catchment of players which cannot even be compared in terms of size.</p>
<p>Wanganui were awarded the trophy for Outstanding Team Culture and Fairplay, which was chosen from all 12 teams in the Hurricanes A and B tournaments.</p>
<p>As well as Griffen, others may well be named in two weeks for the Hurricanes Development camp.</p>
