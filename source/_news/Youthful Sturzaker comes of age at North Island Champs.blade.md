<p class="element element-paragraph">Although there hasn't been any local racing for several weeks, Whanganui speedway competitors have been busy around the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former WHS student <strong>Callum Sturzaker</strong> made an immediate impact on the Stockcar class last year when he finished second in the West Coast Stockcars in his first meeting in the class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Over the weekend he gave another glimpse of his potential, finishing in second place in the North Island Stockcar Championship at Meeanee Speedway in Napier.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sturzaker was one of five Whanganui cars in the 100-plus car field, and along with Blair Lockett qualified directly for Saturday night's 30-car finals field.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After two of the three finals races, both Lockett and Sturzaker sat just outside the top three on points, but within striking distance of the leaders.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It wasn't to be for Lockett however; the crew discovered a problem with the car's water pump, and he was unable to contest the final race.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sturzaker started the final race from grid 17, and drove a heady race, avoiding the carnage and progressing through the field to finish third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That was enough to place the young Whanganui driver in second place overall, eight points behind winner Josh Prentice from Wellington, and three points ahead of third place-getter, Michael Rumney from Rotorua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This is far and away the best result of Sturzaker's career to date, and sets him up for two important Stockcar meetings at Fast Lane Spares Oceanview Family Speedway.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The West Coast Stockcars will be contested on Saturday, January 12, with the big-money Elite Mechanical Stockcar Cup on the line the following weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Streetstock driver Simon Bland contracts to Whanganui every season, although he lives and works in the Mid-Canterbury region.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But his long trip to Rotorua was made worthwhile by a top ten finish in the class's premier event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Close, even racing saw the top ten cars separated by just ten points.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And there's an exodus of race cars heading south for the New Zealand Superstock Championships at Woodford Glen near Christchurch this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui will be well represented by the quartet of Mason James, Shaun Smith, Kerry Podjursky and <strong>Max Holloway</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) among the field of almost 100 cars entered for the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mason James is a late substitution for father Daryl James, who is nursing an injury.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 52V car looked an unlikely starter when a blown head gasket was discovered on Tuesday afternoon. However the crew and top engine builder Chad Ace burned the midnight oil to repair the car in readiness for the trip.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Smith has been impressive in his new car this season, improving with every outing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Holloway</strong> was the surprise package at last season's NZ Superstocks in Auckland, and with another season's experience under his belt is tipped to perform well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The veteran Podjursky is a seasoned campaigner, and a lack of recent racing should not hamper his chances.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He controversially missed qualifying for the finals last year, after being passed by several cars while the red lights were on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And whilst the Great Superstock Migration is to the south this year, it will be a different story on the first weekend of 2020.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event will take place at Oceanview Friday 3rd and Saturday 4th January 2020, attracting competitors and spectators from all over the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It will be the first time the Wanganui Stockcar and Speedway Club has hosted this premier event since the 2207-08 season, and work is already underway to make it a meeting to remember.</p>
