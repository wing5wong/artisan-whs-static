There has been some side menu offers available from Parnells Café this week to celebrate Matariki.

In the Māori language, Matariki is both the name of the Pleiades star cluster and also of the season of its first rising in late May or early June. This is a marker of the beginning of the New Year.

Parnells, Aroha Mackintosh, said her mother and business owner, Te Aroha Mackintosh, had gotten some muttonbird for herself at the end of the season, but had enough of it that she wanted to offer it to the public as a reflection of Matariki.

“She’s a big fan of muttonbird; we decided it would be an add-on.”

The café is offering a traditional boil up meal, but with muttonbird, which is a rare delicacy.

Also added to the menu is Horopito & Pikopiko Pork Belly, as Parnells has brought in Pikopiko – the “bush asparagus” – and dried it to hold with the pork, for a “common but traditional” meal.

Kawakawa, one of the most important herbs in traditional herbal Māori medicine, has also been brought in to make a special Crème Brulee dish.

Aroha Mackintosh said they started offering the items on Tuesday and the word is out amongst local Maori organisations that the food is available.

But, of course, everyone is encouraged to try the special menu, with the prospect that the pork belly and brulee could become regular items if the demand is there.

The special side menu is available through until this Sunday, July 19, at Parnells, 349 Victoria Ave.
