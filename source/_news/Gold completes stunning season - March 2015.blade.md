<p>Wanganui High School's Jessica Brougham and Kayla Spencer completed a stunning summer on the water with gold in the girls under-18 double sculls at the 2015 Maadi Cup at Lake Karapiro last week.</p>
<p>Having medalled at the club nationals for Aramoho Wanganui RC and won gold together for WHS at the Secondary School North Island championships, the pair lived up to their favourites tag in the double sculls final with a 7m 24.83s row being three seconds quicker than the St Peters School pair, with Rangiora High School in third.</p>
<p>Chris Harris, former WHS star and fellow AWRC member in elite men's competition joined the girls and their coach Ian Weenink on the victory dais.</p>
<p>While winning five gold medals at the North Island champs three weeks ago, WHS did not have as strong a return at the nationals, with the other medal being bronze in the under-18 lightweight double sculls final.</p>
<p>Matthew Wright (stroke) and Nathan Luff finished in 6m 51.45s, three seconds behind the winning team from Marlborough Boys College, with Wellington College in second.</p>
<p>WHS rowers made five other A Finals, while Collegiate rowers were represented in three A Finals.</p>
<p>Wanganui Girls College, Nga Tawa Diocesan School and Cullinane College crews were also represented amongst 2196 competitors at the nationals.</p>
