<p>GOING STATESIDE: &nbsp;Wanganui prospect Akira Marsters (former WHS student) will attend the Impact Basketball Academy in Las Vegas this month.</p>
<p>He's come a long way for a former longshoreman on the Nelson docks who was repeating his last year of high school.</p>
<p>Wanganui basketball prospect Akira Marsters will depart on Tuesday for his long anticipated sojourn at the Impact Basketball Academy in Las Vegas, as he looks to follow his dream of earning a scholarship to an American college playing at NCAA Division 1 level.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old former Nelson Giant rookie stepped away from the NBL last year in order to raise funds to attend the prestigious academy, and was accepted after he was noticed during the New Zealand Under 23 tour to the United States at the end of 2013.</p>
<p>He was originally going to go in September, but the familiar story of injury - he nearly missed the U23 tour with a muscle tear - stopped him going.</p>
<p>"I stuffed up my finger at work, and that delayed me because I didn't want to go over not feeling 100 per cent."</p>
<p>Marsters then planned to join the academy in February, but got the phone call in the first week of January that he was needed immediately, which required some last-minute fundraising.</p>
<p>"It's $8000 in two and a half weeks - pretty crazy."</p>
<p>Marsters is flying to San Francisco, then driving to Las Vegas, and he plans to be at the academy for at least two months.</p>
<p>The small forward or point guard wants to play in a game against the Findlay Prep Basketball team from Nevada, as part of a continuous programme of training and games within the academy.</p>
<p>Marsters will live in accommodation across the street, and pay board and food. Each day will start with weightlifting, followed by skills sessions, and games in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Six and a half days a week; you don't get much rest," he said.</p>
<p>"These coaches train NBA players, and if I'm there long enough, I could potentially train against a lot of the top college players that get drafted into the NBA.</p>
<p>"But it's so expensive - $25,000 for six months.</p>
<p>"I'm not getting any younger, so I better go over."</p>
<p>At the start of last year, Marsters declined a scholarship from California State University, which plays lower NCAA Division basketball.</p>
<p>He is currently looking at an expression of interest from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, where his former New Zealand teammate Liam McRae is based.</p>
<p>That school's team - the Nebraska Cornhuskers - made it to the NCAA Division 1 tournament last year under coach Tim Miles for the first time since 1999.</p>
<p>Locally, Marsters has received help to get to America from Imlay-Affco, Affco-Canteen, the Splash Centre, Inspire Gym, Fight Fit, Rutherford Junior High, Carlton School and Faith City Church.</p>
