<p><span>MUD PACK: <strong>WHS student Jordan Hatch</strong> cleared out from the pack to finish third overall in the B Grade class at the Wanganui Motorcycle Club's flat track series.</span></p>
<p>The Wanganui Motorcycle Club's flat track series has proven very much a family affair with father and son combinations dominating the three-meeting competition.</p>
<p>The final round was held on a rain-soaked Maxwell course over the weekend with the Wainhouse and the Rountree clans prominent throughout the classes.</p>
<p>More than 60 riders battled the conditions during the final round.</p>
<p>Siblings Riki and <strong>Joe Wainhouse</strong> (former WHS student) were runners-up in the Junior 8-12 and Junior 250cc classes respectively over the three meeting series, while father Shayne finished the Veteran 30-39 year competition third overall.</p>
<p>But it was the Rountree family that perhaps did best with father Ant claiming both the A grade over 250cc and Veteran 40 and over classes, while son James winning the Most Improved Junior title and finishing second overall in the Junior 13-16-year grade. Brother Blake was also second in the Junior 125cc class.</p>
<p>The A Grade under 250cc grade was taken out by the ever-consistent Danny Williamson who also finished second to Rountree in the 40 and over Veterans class.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
