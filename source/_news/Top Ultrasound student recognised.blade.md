<p>UCOL Bachelor of Applied Science (Medical Imaging Technology) student Saxon Toomer (former WHS student) was recently presented with the Sarah Brown Award for the being the top of his class in Ultrasound.</p>
<p><span>The Sarah Brown Award is presented annually to the third year&nbsp;</span><a title="UCOL's Bachelor of Applied Science (Medical Imaging Technology)" href="http://www.ucol.ac.nz/programmes/health-science/bachelor-of-applied-science-(medical-imaging-technology)">Medical Imaging Technology (MIT)</a><span>&nbsp;student who achieved the highest grade in the previous year&rsquo;s Ultrasound course.</span></p>
<p><span>Saxon was presented with the Sarah Brown Award plaque, a certificate, and $100 in front of his classmates.</span></p>
<p><span>Saxon says the award came as a surprise to him.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it coming, but it feels good to know the hard work pays off.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Originally from London, Saxon has been living in Whanganui for the past decade and hopes to work at the Whanganui Hospital once he graduates.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing my clinical placement there at the moment, and it&rsquo;s going really good. I get on well with all of the staff.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Saxon says he was originally drawn to the MIT degree by his love of biology and physics.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;I like the idea that it&rsquo;s science-based and a practical degree. &nbsp;It all blends well together.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>He hopes to do further training in Ultrasound, Computer Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and eventually travel to Australia or the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span><span>MIT Programme Leader Peter Benson says Saxon has consistently achieved excellent grades throughout all of his studies.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Sarah Brown award is named in memory of a former MIT student who passed away during the final year of her degree. She was looking to specialise in Ultrasound after she graduated.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>MIT students are introduced to specialised imaging techniques such as Ultrasound, Nuclear Medicine, and MRI in the second year of the degree.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;While we are preparing students for careers as Medical Radiation Technologists, part of the course is about understanding the other aspects of medical imaging so our students can look to specialise in these areas later in their careers,&rdquo; says Peter.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
