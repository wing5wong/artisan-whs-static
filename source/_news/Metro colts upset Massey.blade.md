<p class="element element-paragraph">St Johns Club Whanganui Metro has found the key to breach the Massey White fortress after a narrow, but confidence-building win over the multiple Manawatu McDonald's Colts division match at Cooks Gardens on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Massey White has gone through pool play unbeaten to win the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Colts division championships, but this season the competition nemesis has had a case of the hiccups.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In round one Feilding beat Massey White and now Metro have also breached the defences winning 18-17 on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Metro manager Chris Friedel said the game was a match to behold with even the most expert eye struggling to pick a winner until the final whistle blew.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a great game," Friedel said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We led 8-7 at half time and ended with a win to us by a solitary point. Both teams played extremely good rugby and even though it was the start of university holidays Massey was full strength."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For Friedel and co-coaches Carl Gibson and Darryl Malcolm it was been a five year battle to finally beat the top side.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"All three of us were three years with Whanganui High School in this division and now in our second with Metro and to finally beat Massey White is a huge achievement. There are some very big boys in the Massey team."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The win ensures Metro a spot in the July 22 final and while it is mathematically possible for another team to make the final, it is highly unlikely.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It looks like a Metro/Massey final, although they have had their bye and play Old Boys Marist this weekend and they are a pretty tidy team. We have the bye this weekend and then play Kia Toa the week before the final. Kia Toa has yet to win a game, so it should be a good warm-up for us ahead of the final."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Friedel said while the narrow victory at the weekend was a full team effort he singled out captain and blindside flanker George Forster, lock Lochie Steedman and No8 Brayden Maua for special mention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"George has great captaining skills and marshals the troups very well leading from the front, while Lochie was outstanding at lineout time claiming quality ball for our backs.&nbsp;<br />Brayden is a real up-and-comer. We were also helped with the return of Corbin Warren (No7) from a month-long concussion break," Friedel said.</p>
