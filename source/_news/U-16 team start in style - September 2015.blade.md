<p>The Wanganui Under-16 team had a strong start to their Hurricanes Division B tournament in Levin, beating East Coast U-16 29-7 in Levin yesterday.</p>
<p>Leading 17-0 at halftime, Wanganui tackled very well against their physically bigger opponents, while the scrum was dominant.</p>
<p>It set the platform for the outside backs to all have a crack, and they scored four of the team's five tries.</p>
<p>Fullback <strong>Matt Kleinsmith</strong> (WHS student), second-five Corey-Lee Robertson, and wingers Shaiden Daniels and Myrin Kumeroa all dotted down.</p>
<p>Wanganui were also awarded a penalty try for a high tackle in the act of scoring.</p>
<p>Kevin Mischefski added two conversions.</p>
<p>The players who stood out were Daniels, Robertson, centre Adam Boult and lock Joseph So'oalo.</p>
<p>Wanganui's next game is today at 11am against Hawkes Bay Development.</p>
