<p class="element element-paragraph">One Whanganui man is notorious for collecting fish stamps. Another is on a mission to collect a stamp from every country in the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Yesterday the Philatelic Club hosted the annual stamp and coin fair at the RSA in Whanganui and gathered over 200 people.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Philatelic Club president John Burlace (photo below) said every collector has their unique preference.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It ran from 10 am to 4pm and was aimed not only at stamp dealers but also a promotion for all sorts of collectibles including bank notes and war medals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Burlace said the Philatelic Club has been working in conjunction with the Coin Club in alternate years to host the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Worldwide there has been a real interest in New Zealand stamps, particularly from China and Japan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But it's not just stamp dealers we are trying to attract . . . we are also trying to promote the hobby and gather additional members," Mr Burlace said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bevan Hunter showed his interest in stamps collecting New Zealand post mark stamps.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Back in the day, especially during war time, every post box had a unique stamp so I've done a bit of research and found heaps from all around New Zealand," 35-year-old Mr Hunter said.</p>
