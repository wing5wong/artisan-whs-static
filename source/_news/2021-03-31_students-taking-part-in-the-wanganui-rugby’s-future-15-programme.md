Well done to our 4 students who were apart of the Wanganui Rugby’s Future 15 programme. 

Kiera Te Huia, Paris Munro, Taine Te Waaka and Keaton Rawson. 

The programmes main goal is to teach the rugby athletes professional habits.
They do this by teaching them about Strength and Conditioning, Goal Setting, Nutrition and Mental Skills. Nearing the end of this programme they go into a Rugby Professional Environment to see all that we have learnt in action.

Our students went into the Hurricanes camp in Wellington, watched them train S&C, took a nutrition class, went to Sky Stadium and got to go onto the grass to watch the Hurricanes Captain Run.

Great experience for them all. Well done team!
