Brass Whanganui's surround sound art and music event Sound Canvas returns, after being postponed by Covid-19.

It's on Saturday, October 31, at 3pm and 7pm, and on Sunday, November 1 at 2pm, and includes **Whanganui High School students Luke Squire (playing the cornet) and Jonathan Stolk (playing percussion).**

Presented completely on stage at the Royal Wanganui Opera House, audience and all, Sound Canvas is an experience for music and art lovers, especially those who enjoy the unpredictable.

Brass Whanganui music director Bruce Jellyman says the band will be sitting in such a position that the audience, also on stage, will be looking out beyond the band into the auditorium.

Until, that is, the show starts, then all attention will be on the band and in the room.

"I like to use all the tools available, so everything will be done by the band. The poetry's read by the band, the musical performance and all the bits and pieces are done by the band."

The poetry is all by New Zealand poets and some is by local writers.

This is the second Sound Canvas but Bruce says it will be different from the first.

"It's of the same ilk but we are pushing the boundaries further all the time."

Like last year, the band plays, recites, sings and performs in various ways while images of high quality art by local artists are projected on to a large screen.

"There are times when the band needs to be the centre of attention and there are times when I'd rather you just experienced the room.

"One of my favourite moments in this programme is this bit where we go through really haunting, kind of environmental sounds, underpinned with Maori instruments."

Bruce likens it to a quiet time by the Whanganui River at Jerusalem.

There is plenty of light and shade in the music and there is bound to be humour.

"There will be players all around the place: there'll be stuff happening in the middle and around [the audience], and there's a big finale and we'll jam you out of the place.

"Because it's so continuous and stuff's on the go all the time, it's quite intense for the performers but it's also very intense for the audience because you're in it."

Two pieces for the performance have been written by Bruce's son Hamish Jellyman.

Bruce has tried for a loose musical connection with the art works, without being obvious. He has aimed for musical sympathy with the emotion produced by looking at the work.

"I hope it brings a level of continuity with the way everything feels."

The audience will be provided with a programme, listing all the music, poetry and art in order.
