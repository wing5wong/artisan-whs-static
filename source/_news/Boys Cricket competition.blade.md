<p><strong>Congratulations to WHS 1st XI Cricket team</strong> who competed in the Whanganui Secondary School Cup T20 competition on Wednesday.</p>
<p><span>Six teams competed in the competition. Each team played two games before playing in the finals. </span></p>
<p><strong>WHS won both of their games against Rangitikei High School and Cullinane College.</strong></p>
<p><span>WHS ended up tied for top place with two other teams. Organisers then had to work out which two teams would complete in the final by using the Net Run Rate formula. </span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately WHS missed out playing in the final. </span></p>
<p><strong>Great team effort</strong> with an outstanding batting innings of 84 by <strong>Quinn Mailman</strong> and bowling innings by <strong>Reece Hoobin</strong> who took 6 wickets for 4 runs off 2 overs. They finished 3rd overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Next week we see our boys playing in the Central District T20 final here in Wanganui, 1st November at Victoria Park.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the best boys!</strong></p>
