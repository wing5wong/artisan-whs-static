Congratulations to Violet Tofa, whose artwork was selected from over 250 entries and gained a “Commended” for the prestigious Ringa Toi exhibition.

Ringa Toi is recognised nationally as a vehicle to enhance student engagement, achievement and retention, while advancing mātauranga Māori and Pacific knowledges. Each year ākonga from across Aotearoa submit artworks for judging, with awards presented for Highly Commended, Commended, and People’s Choice.

Violet’s work, created through Toi Mātatuhi (printmaking), represents her Pacific Island heritage and childhood memories. She explains:

“This piece weaves together cultural symbolism, nature and childhood fun. At the top is a tuiga, a traditional Samoan headpiece, alongside banana leaves from childhood. Below are siapo mats, a pate (drum), and poi — representing music and dance. I also included a jellyfish, my favourite sea creature, and a surfboard for dreams and hobbies. The national flag shows cultural pride, while the kava bowl reflects gathering, respect and tradition. Ocean waves, shells, and flowers highlight the Island environment. Every part holds meaning from my culture and is a way to honour my roots.”

This is a wonderful achievement and a proud celebration of creativity, culture, and identity. 

The exhibition is on now at Te Papa, in Wellington, until the 28th September.
