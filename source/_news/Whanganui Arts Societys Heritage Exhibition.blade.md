<p class="element element-paragraph">The past will be celebrated in a Wanganui Arts Society exhibition timed for Vintage Weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The society's&nbsp;<em>Heritage Exhibition</em>&nbsp;will include drawings, paintings and craft work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some of the paintings have never been on display before, such as Barbara McPhail's depiction of draught horses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will also be craft works: a restored chair, embroidery, crochet, bobbin lace and Nordic Hardanger embroidery patterns. Spinning and lace making will be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The show is at the society's little building near the cycling velodrome. It's reached from Ridgway St, through gates and a short length of Trafalgar Place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's open on January 14 from 10am to noon. During Vintage Weekend it's open on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, from 10am to 3pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Raewyn Laird will demonstrate making bobbin lace on the Saturday, and Elly Te Ua will demonstrate spinning on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gilly Brown's vintage clothing will be available to see and buy on each day.</p>
