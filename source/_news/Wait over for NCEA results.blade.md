<p>Michaela Watson's school days are behind her now that she's received her NCEA results.</p>
<p>The Whanganui 18 year old was one of more than 158,000 New Zealand students who were tested in 119 National Certificate of Achievement [NCEA] exams in 2016.</p>
<p>NCEA results were released on the New Zealand Qualifications Authority website on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Michaela, who sat NCEA level 3 in English, history, social studies, classics, photograpy and maths at Whanganui High School, said she had received her results on the school website on Monday, but had them confirmed on the NZQA website on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I did pretty well - I passed everything. But I didn't do as good in some subjects as I hoped I would."</p>
<p>Michaela said she and her friends had been comparing their results since they'd been released. She said she was glad to know her results, but wasn't planning any special celebration.</p>
<p>In a couple of months Michaela will move to Palmerston North to study at Massey University.</p>
<p>"I'm going to study for a BA [Bachelor of Arts] in sociology and education because I want to be a primary school teacher."</p>
<p>There were reports that the NZQA website had crashed on Tuesday; but Michaela said she had had no trouble logging into the website.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 students logged in to check their results in the first thirty minutes, New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) spokeswoman Lisa Gibbison said results were released online at 7am on Tuesday.</p>
<p>By noon that number had climbed to 65,000, with about 25,000 logins each hour, as many students logged in more than once.</p>
<p>She said the website had not crashed but was loading slower than usual because of the high traffic volume.</p>
