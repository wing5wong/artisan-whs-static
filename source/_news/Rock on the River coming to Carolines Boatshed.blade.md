<p>Rock on the River coming to Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed &ndash; 6 January 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced classic rock band Whiskey Mama will be joined by two up and coming Whanganui High School bands &ndash; &lsquo;Ferris&rsquo; and &lsquo;In Business&rsquo; &ndash; in a Rock on the River concert at Caroline&rsquo;s Boatshed on Sunday, 6 January starting at 2pm.</strong></p>
<p>It will be outside and the stage will be a truck trailer in the car park area with the bands facing the deck area. If the weather doesn&rsquo;t play fair, the concert will be postponed till the fo<span class="text_exposed_show">llowing week.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Whiskey Mama consists of well-known musicians Fred Loveridge on guitar and vocals along with partner Kerry O&rsquo;Sullivan as lead vocals. Accompanying them are Glen March on drums, John Steedman on bass and vocals and Kevin Delacy on key board and vocals.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Fred says, &ldquo;We play mainly &lsquo;Classic Rock&rsquo; and include a lot of songs which are not often played live and also hits which were not the big ones. People like hearing alternatives to the songs played all the time.&rdquo; Fred himself plays with the Whanganui Jazz Big Band and Re-set and has been involved with a number of bands in Whanganui.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Many of their songs come from Fleetwood Mac, The Pretenders, and Blondie as well as more obscure groups such as Georgia Satellites. Fred adds, &ldquo;We will play anything from Carole King through to Deep Purple.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>It will be a great opportunity for the High School bands to get exposure along with Whiskey Mama. Fred is connected with these bands through his role as a teacher of performance and guitar at High School.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">He says, &ldquo;<strong>Ferris</strong> is a really likeable Indie Pop type group who play totally original music. They featured in this year&rsquo;s Rock Quest and have performed as the opening act for a touring band.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>&lsquo;In Business&rsquo;</strong> members are &ldquo;year 9 students this year and play original as well as cover classics and also have a female vocalist.&rdquo; Each band will play for 30 to 40 minutes each and after a short changeover, Whiskey Mama will take to the stage and &ldquo;we will play as long as people want us.&rdquo;</span></p>
