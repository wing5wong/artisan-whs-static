<h3 class="element element-paragraph">The wins keep coming for Whanganui High School students as they have won the M3S: Massey Manawatu Maths and Stats Competition for a second consecutive year.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winning team of Ben Power, Ahimsha Saravanapavan and Nanea Schurhammer faced stiff competition from 22 other teams from Taranaki to Kapiti.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has been running for five years and this is Whanganui High School's third time winning the competition that tests teams on problems that require skill and time management.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Massey University senior mathematics tutor, Dr Cami Sawyer, said it was great to see the students working hard and sharing ideas with each other to solve challenging problems.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Days like this provide mathematically gifted students a chance to showcase their talent, work in groups and see mathematics and statistics as more than subjects, but actual study paths at university and careers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These days provide better reflections of real mathematics careers, as working in groups to solve problems is more reflective of the industry than sitting at a desk alone solving problems in isolation with a 3-hour time limit."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, the format of the competition for Year 12 students changed to a quiz-like format with five rounds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Teams got all the questions at once and had fixed periods of time to answer them, ranging from 10 to 12 minutes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Head of the institute of fundamental sciences professor Martin Hazelton hoped the students would stick with these disciplines.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The jobs we have today and increasingly the jobs of the future will need the skills you have demonstrated today," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So keep at it in class and it is going to pay-off in your future careers."</p>
