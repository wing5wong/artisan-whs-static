<p><strong>Sophie Baldwin and Jack Walker, both from WHS, enjoyed their 20 minute &ldquo;Flight of Discovery&rdquo; in the October school holidays at the Commercial Pilot Academy in Wanganui.</strong></p>
<p>Commercial Pilot Academy had a stand at the Year 10 Careers Expo held on Friday 25 August at Jubliee Staduim.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a competition for students to &ldquo;Like&rdquo; our Facebook page to win a free 20 minute Flight.&nbsp; The two winners were Sophie Baldwin and Jack Walker both from WHS.</p>
<p>They both came in the school holidays and had a tour of our new Academy, time in the C90 King Air Simulator and also.</p>
<p>Included are photo's of Sophie&nbsp;on her day at the Commercial Pilot Academy, which Sophie&rsquo;s mum, Amanda kindly sent us.</p>
<p><strong>We are having an Open Day on Sunday 29&nbsp;October, 10-2pm.&nbsp;</strong></p>
