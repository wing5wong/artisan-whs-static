<p><span>TRICKS OF THE TRADE: Occupational therapist and former WHS student Amber Ward (left) with acting patient using a medicine ball for desk comfort.</span></p>
<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world</strong></p>
<p>Active, broad and rewarding are three words Amber Ward uses to describe the job she loves.</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student has just cracked her second year working as a qualified occupational therapist and hasn't looked back.</p>
<p>Her job is to assess and treat people who, because of illness, injury or circumstance, have limited ability to carry out everyday activities.</p>
<p>Six years ago, as a year 12 high school student, Miss Ward had no idea about a career, let alone the role of an occupational therapist.</p>
<p>She approached a career advisory service in Whanganui called Smithells and, after being questioned about her values and enjoyment, the adviser recommended three options - a physio, a teacher or an occupational therapist.</p>
<p>"Teacher didn't appeal and physio seemed too functional - I'm a people person and I wanted a job that helped people so I decided to find out more about occupational therapy." she said.</p>
<p>She shadowed a therapist for a day to understand the role first hand.</p>
<p>"If you are interested in a career, I recommend spending a day with someone already in that role ... it is so different to learning about it on paper.</p>
<p>"I would be happy to have students considering occupational therapy to shadow me for a day."</p>
<p>After finishing secondary school in 2011, Miss Ward completed a three-year bachelor of occupational therapy at Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin. The course included six different placements throughout New Zealand and the Cook Islands.</p>
<p>She now works for a private practice in Whanganui called Active Plus, and said there were many different settings for the job - among them hospital and rehabilitation departments, schools and within the community.</p>
<p>"My university course recommended placements in different settings - you got a good taste of different areas you might want to get into."</p>
<p>In year 13, Miss Ward took English and biology to prepare for the role and she suggests studying subjects which focus on human anatomy.</p>
<p>"Being able to communicate, motivate and relate to people from every walk of life is an vital part of the job.</p>
<p>"Those skills stem from a combination of schooling, university and your own life experiences - you're either into it or you're not."</p>
<p>She said the satisfaction of helping people regain their independence and passion as well as the broad environment she works in were the best parts of her job.</p>
<p>"One day I could be out with a dairy farmer, another day I could be out in a forestry gang or helping with a desk set-up - every day is different which I love."</p>
<p>She said taking a pilates class once a week was an added bonus of the job and great for improving mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
