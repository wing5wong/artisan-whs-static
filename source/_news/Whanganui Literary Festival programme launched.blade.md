<p class="element element-paragraph">Also at the launch was a painting on glass by Whanganui artist Aaron Potaka,&nbsp;<em>The muse presents the writer with a fully developed draft.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is the image that's on our programme cover. It's the third time in a row that Aaron has provided an image for our programme, and we're very grateful for his support."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Tasker said this year's festival has a "very full" programme.</p>
