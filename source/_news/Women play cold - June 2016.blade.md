<p><strong>CENTRAL DUTIES: Whanganui international Emma Rainey (WHS student) is one of possibly seven from the River City playing in the combined Taranaki/Whanganui women's team in Palmerston North over Queen's Birthday.</strong></p>
<p>THE Whanganui/Taranaki combined women's side head into the Central Hockey League tournament over Queen's Birthday cold.</p>
<p>Coached by Whanganui's Jan Dixon, the squad that could feature up to seven River City players has had no time to practise as a unit in the lead-up to the four-match tournament.</p>
<p>Whanganui players named in the combined side include <strong>Emma Rainey, Rebecca Baker (WHS student),</strong> Kate Tylee, Grace Godfrey, Sarah Stichbury, and possibly Melissa Goss and Amelia Stanley, who has been under an injury cloud and requires clearance to play. She will be assessed today.</p>
<p><strong>Baker</strong>, Godfrey and Tylee are fresh from two wins from two games for the Dixon-coached U-18 Whanganui side last weekend in Napier.</p>
<p>"The combined team for this weekend don't get to practise before our first games in Palmerston North on Saturday just like the U-18 girls last weekend," Dixon said yesterday.</p>
<p>Dixon conceded there was ample individual talent in the team, but not knowing the Taranaki girls well did make life difficult.</p>
<p>"I don't know many of the Taranaki girls, so putting combinations together is going to be hard."</p>
<p>The combined side go under the Western Central banner in the tournament and they line up against teams from Manawatu, Hawkes Bay and Mid Central (combined Horowhenua/Rangitikei).</p>
<p>Whanganui will send its own men's team to battle it out with rivals from Hawkes Bay, Manawatu, Taranaki and Horowhenua.</p>
<p>Selectors searching for potential players to join the National Hockey League squad may also be on hand on Twin Turf in Palmerston North over the weekend.</p>
