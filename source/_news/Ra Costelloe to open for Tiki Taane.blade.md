<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui musician and former WHS student Ra Costelloe is set to play the biggest gig of his young career.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 23-year-old has been performing for three years, but only decided to start taking it seriously this year and it has paid off big time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On October 6, Costelloe will open for New Zealand music icon Tiki Taane at Blue Smoke in Christchurch and he is stoked about it.</p>
<p><span><span>"It was a real humbling moment to find out that I'm opening for such a New Zealand legend, I was speechless, I just jumped up and down a bit," Costelloe says.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"Tiki Taane has influenced me. We used to jam&nbsp;</span><em>Always on my Mind</em><span>&nbsp;at high school, it was such an iconic song in New Zealand that everybody loved."</span></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Taane recently posted a video on Facebook announcing that he was searching for an opening act and Costelloe got the gig from among almost 200 entries.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Taane was impressed by Costelloe's single&nbsp;<em>Stuck in Love</em>&nbsp;which was released with a new video recently, filmed in Whanganui's Durie Hill tunnel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"<em>Stuck in Love</em>&nbsp;was written four years ago from the perspective of being stuck in a place you can't get out of. It speaks for itself, there aren't any hidden meanings," Costelloe says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The relevance of shooting it in the tunnel is that you get that feeling that you're trapped and there's a long way ahead. Also, it's just a cool looking tunnel."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Born in Cornwall, England, Costelloe and his family moved to Whanganui when he was 4 years old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I grew up on a farm with a piano and no internet or TV. We all play piano in the family, but I never learned the guitar," Costelloe says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was Dad who was keen on the Irish gig scene, he plays guitar and used to sing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Costelloe went to Whanganui High School. When he finished there he moved to Invercargill to study contemporary music at SIT and then moved to Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the capital, he went gigging whenever he could, wherever he could and would record covers and upload them on social media.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He now lives in Mangamahu.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I came back this year. It's been really exciting, we've shot a few originals in Whanganui and now I've got an album prepared.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The music scene here is getting there, it's buzzing. It feels like it's about to get to the next level.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are so many names coming here, Stan Walker, House of Shem are always coming to Whanganui for gigs and that's exciting."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The aforementioned acts are inspirations for Costelloe, as are Australian musician Matt Corby, Kiwi kingpins Six60 and American powerhouse Christian Aguilera.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He describes his sound as a modern take on blues, R&amp;B and reggae.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"New Zealand has its own sound. I'm so glad we came here, all of the bands have their own unique sound and I'm in love with that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I want to push for that, the world needs to hear that more and that's what I'm trying to do with my music."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Costelloe is nearing the production stage of his album. It has been self funded through gigs, more than 1000 album sales and regular busking at the Whanganui River Markets.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Social media has put his name out there and soon Costelloe will embark on a trip to Poland where he has been booked for a private gig.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For now, there's only one thing that's always on his mind and that's Christchurch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think about it before I go to sleep at night and think about it again when I wake up," Costelloe says.</p>
<p><span><span>"Every time I think about music, which is every minute of every day, I think about this gig."</span></span></p>
