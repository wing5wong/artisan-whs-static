Well done to Aspen Fell who had her first Artistic Skating Competition of the 2020 season in Upper Hutt over the weekend.

Aspen got 1st place in Junior international dance.

This is a combined scoring event where scores are given for two routines of Style Dance and Freedance. Aspen also got 1st place for Advanced Figures.

Great start for 2020!!💚🥇🥇💛
