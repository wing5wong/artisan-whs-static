<p>VICTORIOUS: Overall winner WHS student Briella Maua, 15, with Muddy River Country Music Awards convenor Elaine Holden.</p>
<p>Briella Maua sang her way to winning yet more trophies in Wanganui last weekend.</p>
<p>The Muddy River Country Music Awards were for people under 18, convenor Elaine Holden said, and there was only one other competition for young country singers in New Zealand.</p>
<p>This year there were 31 competitors with 84 entries, including from Cambridge, Te Awamutu, Hawera and Wellington.</p>
<p>Briella, 15, was a fantastic singer, the convenor said. She had entered last year and was encouraged to enter again.</p>
<p>"I thought she would do very well, so I am very happy."</p>
<p>The teenager won the intermediate solo section, the gospel section and came second in the intermediate traditional section.</p>
<p>She sang Hank Cochran's Make the World Go Away to win the overall title.</p>
<p>Briella is no stranger to performance. Her parents said she had a strong drive to entertain with song, music and dance.</p>
<p>She's been in Wanganui High School and Wanganui Intermediate School productions.</p>
<p>At the age of 11 she was chosen to sing the national anthem at a Meads Cup rugby final at Cooks Gardens, and she used to perform at a lot of country music events.</p>
<p>Dad Dion Maua said his daughter had always wanted to perform and excel, and had never had stage fright.</p>
<p>She took dancing lessons at the Sharyn Underwood School of Dance, and had weekly singing lessons with Lynn Whiteside.</p>
<p>"She has a superb voice," he said.</p>
<p>"Many people at the awards came up to us after and commented on its quality."</p>
<p>The awards were held in the Wanganui Girls' College Hall, with a concert by finalists on Saturday night. Each was backed by a five-piece band. The judges were John de Burgh, Daniel Harding and Gillian Bailey, and Briella won a total of $380.</p>
