<p><strong>WHS student Sarya Lower won gold in the 15-year-old girls 50 breast stroke, 200m individual medley and the 100m freestyle at the Wellington Long Course Championships.</strong></p>
<p>It was another strong anniversary weekend for the Toyota Whanganui Swim team at the Wellington Long Course (50m pool) championships.</p>
<p>Club spokesman Neil Forlong said their 16 swimmers involved picked up 13 medals and every club member recorded either a personal best time or made the finals.</p>
<p>"The usual suspects were again to the fore with Sarya Lower winning gold in the 15-year-old girls 50 breast stroke, 200m individual medley and the 100m freestyle," said Forlong.</p>
<p>"Sarya also won the prize for the highest points scoring female in the 15-year-old age group, the first time this has been won by a Whanganui swimmer."</p>
<p>Shannon Schimanski's class was on display with some of her best swims to win gold the 50m and 100m breaststroke for the 16-17-year-old girls, while also being the fastest female overall in the 50m.</p>
<p>Schimanski backed up those fine swims with silver in the 200m breaststroke and 50m backstroke, along with bronze in the 50m freestyle.</p>
<p>The club's youngest competitor at the competition was Aria Bannister, 9, who showed she will be a contender at the NZ Junior Carnival after a silver medal in the 9-years-and-under 100m freestyle, plus bronze medals in the 100m of breaststroke and backstroke.</p>
<p>Whanganui's final medal came from 11-year-old Cayden Earles who finished second in the 50m backstroke in her age group.</p>
<p>Other swimmers to gain top ten placings were Georgia Abraham (11), Ethan Bryers (12), Henry Carver (11), Liam Cromar (10), Alexandra Forlong (15), Nikki Forlong (11), Michael Hiroti (16), Cheyenne Nightingale (11), Lucy Somerville (11) and Niamh Hogan (16).</p>
<p>Hogan also qualified to attend the National Age Group championships in the 50m and 200m back stroke.</p>
<p>John Bryant (11) and Sophie Bell (10) recorded some great personal best times.</p>
<p>The next outing for the Whanganui swim team is a carnival in Hawera this weekend, where a number of junior swimmers will be looking to either qualify or add more events to their schedule at the NZ Junior Carnival in Wellington.</p>
