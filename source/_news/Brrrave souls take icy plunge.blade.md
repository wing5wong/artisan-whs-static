<p class="element element-paragraph">Screams were heard amongst an icy blowing breeze as Whanganui locals of all ages made contact with the incoming tides of water at Castlecliff Beach.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Screaming was just one reaction to the clash between wintery water and cold skin, others ran back to shore to grab towels and some stood still, teeth chattering uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the More FM Polar Plunge 2018 and dress up costumes were made of wigs, capes, hats, masks and even butterfly wings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Friends Erica Tanner, Abby Hurley and Jadzia Morris put in an impressive effort, taking the plunge despite attending Ohakune Mardi Gras the night before.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We went to Mardi Gras as rainbows so we used these leftover balloons for the plunge, they were great flotation devices," Tanner said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It wasn't too cold actually, it was warmer than last year."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tanner was taking part for the second time, while it was three for Morris and four for veteran plunger Tanner, who also attended one in Dunedin recently.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've dressed as bumblebees, brides and now balloons, hey they all start with b," said Morris.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Is that because it's brrr cold?" Tanner replied, eliciting laughs all around.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following the plunge, participants were looking forward to spot prizes being awarded, a sausage sizzle and certificate giving ceremony at Castlecliff Club Inc.</p>
