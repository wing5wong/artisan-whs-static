This year, we took a team of 8 (4 boys / 4 girls) up to Rotorua on Sunday the 7th of May to complete in Hillary Challenge Adventure Racing event. We knew the weekend would be very challenging both physically and mentally, with many activities to keep us thinking and on our toes. We have a young Team with George Davey as Captain then 7, year 10 and 11 students making things more exciting for future years.

The event started in cold wet conditions involving a Rogaine through the Redwoods. We had 6 hours to collect as may points as we could. We used a combination of Mountain Bikes and running on foot to collecting as may controls as possible.

Overall, the event proved to be great fun and a new experience which none of us will forget. We were extremely proud with our result of being placed 8th in the mixed premier grade out of 23 teams.

Adventure Racing is looking strong at WHS.
