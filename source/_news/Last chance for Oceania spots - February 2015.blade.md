<p>Wanganui Judo Club fighters Kasey Watson (white) and Aiden Voice run through a practice session ahead of the national training camp at Springvale Stadium this weekend.</p>
<p>A NATIONAL judo training camp in Wanganui this weekend will feature close to 100 of the country's best fighters ahead of the Oceania tournament in New Caledonia in April.</p>
<p>While most of the New Zealand team have already gained selection, several spots are still up for grabs and fighters will be attempting to impress at Springvale Stadium.</p>
<p>Wanganui judo exponents will be among the 100 at the training camp, including four who have already qualified for Oceania.</p>
<p>Kasey Watson and Aiden Voice, from the Wanganui Judo Club, and Antoine Rahier and Finn Brown, from the Wanganui City College Judo Club, have already qualified for Oceania through their performances at last year's national competition.</p>
<p>Hosted by Wanganui Judo Club, the camp will also feature some of New Zealand's best coaches.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wanganui club coach Wayne Watson said many of the fighters were of Commonwealth and Olympic Games quality and they would be going hard all weekend working on fitness, grappling, ground fighting and techniques to ready themselves for the battle ahead in New Caledonia.</span></p>
<p>"This is the fourth time Wanganui has hosted the training camp, although last year it was in Christchurch," Watson said yesterday.</p>
<p>"The federation asked us to host the camp again this season because we get the numbers. The camp is compulsory for those already in the national team and for those seeking selection. These guys are some of the best male and female fighters in New Zealand and they will be going hard out.</p>
<p>"All will be staying at the Wanganui Boys' and Girls' Gym Club in a communal setting and will live and breathe judo the entire weekend. We are keen for the general public to come along and watch - it's a great spectacle," Watson said.</p>
<p>"It will be Kasey's first time as a New Zealand rep, while Aiden has been there before. There are two categories and the camp will include fight-offs to select the remaining members of the New Zealand Oceania team."</p>
<p>Watson, a former world champion, has not fought competitively for five years, but cannot resist the chance to be physically involved this weekend.</p>
<p>"Yes, I will be on the mat as one of the coaches. I'm not a national coach, but my qualifications are quite high. I'm going to give it a go, I just couldn't resist," Watson said.</p>
<p>The camp begins with two hours of training from 7pm on Friday night and then continue at two-hour intervals between 9am and 6pm on Saturday.</p>
<p>"They'll probably wind up about 1pm on Sunday - they'll all be pretty knackered by then."</p>
