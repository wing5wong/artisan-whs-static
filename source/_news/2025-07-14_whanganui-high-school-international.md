A huge congratulations to Manh Chau Anh Nguyen, who has been awarded a prestigious 2025 New Zealand Schools Scholarship (NZSS)! 🇳🇿✨

On the 22nd of June, Education New Zealand (ENZ) Viet Nam hosted the NZSS Awards Ceremony and Pre-Departure Briefing in Ho Chi Minh City, celebrating this year’s talented scholarship recipients. The event was attended by Mr. Scott James, New Zealand Consul-General & Trade Commissioner in Viet Nam, and Mr. Ben Burrowes, ENZ Regional Director – Asia.

Chau Anh attended the ceremony with her proud parents. We're looking forward to welcoming Chau Anh and her mother to Whanganui this weekend. We know she’ll make the most of everything our school and community have to offer! 🌏📚💫
