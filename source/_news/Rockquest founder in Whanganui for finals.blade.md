<p class="element element-paragraph">Smokefree Rockquest founder Glenn Common will be in Whanganui next weekend for the regional final of this year's youth music event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has been 30 years since Common founded the event with fellow Nelson music teacher Pete Rainey and he plans to make this his final year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has been a wonderful ride but I feel like 30 years is enough," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Looking back, Common says he has great memories of young musicians who went on to launch successful careers and there have been a number from Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"Whanganui High school band The Have, who were the 2002 national winners, were fantastic and Brodie White, Peter Mangan and Mike Tweed are playing in Germany these days."</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Successful solo artist Seth Haapu is another young Whanganui talent Common recalls well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Seth is actually a Rockquest judge on the East Coast now and I think he moved to Rotorua with his family the year after he competed in Whanganui," says Common.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then, of course, there is Michael Franklin-Browne of Head Like a Hole.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think that was back in 1991."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Collegiate band Kate in the Lemon Tree were national winners in 1994.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Franklin-Browne, now a music tutor at UCOL Whanganui, has been mentoring 2018 Whanganui Rockquest hopefuls along with fellow tutors Lizzie de Vegt, Sacha Keating and Andrew Condon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other memorable Whanganui contestants are 2005 regional winners Legions of Sound.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whanganui does seem to breed great musical talent and I love the opera house - it's a fantastic venue."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Common says there is a record number of Whanganui entrants this year and he expects the evening might run late.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We usually finish the night at 9.30 but I suspect it might go until about 10 because it looks like there may be up to 20 entrants."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He does not recall there being such a high number before and says he looks forward to seeing the talent.</p>
