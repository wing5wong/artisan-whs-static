**Congratulations to Danja Grunwald who went to a 3 day Wellington Phoenix experience camp this year and has now been offered a fulltime spot in their academy.** 

Danja is one of two girls in the academy for next year but Wellington Phoenix is working on getting a full women’s squad hopefully by the end of 2021.  

Danja is shifting to Wellington to pursue her dream of becoming a professional football player.  

We wish her all the best for her future ahead in Football. 💛💚⚽️⚽️💚💛
