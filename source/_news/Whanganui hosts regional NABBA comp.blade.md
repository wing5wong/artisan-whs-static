<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Revitalise Natural Health &amp; Fitness Centre will be trying to hang onto their Top Gym prize with a much smaller contingent at the NABBA Manawatu/Wanganui Championships tomorrow night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For the third year in a row, Whanganui gets to host the regional competition, because Palmerston North has been award hosting rights for the 2019 NABBA NZ Nationals, being held on October 26-27.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After two years being held in the Royal Wanganui Opera House, tonight's show is in the War Memorial Centre, and the entry numbers are expected to be down from the 30 who took part last year, being around 15-20.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Revitalise's Audrey O'Keefe, NABBA's 2017 New Zealand Trainer of the Year, said three of her members are taking part, which is also all of the locals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five members of Revitalise took part last year, and their collective points from competition was enough to win the prestigious Top Gym prize after six years of trying.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, Human Movement Fitness Centre from Palmerston North are bringing over the most competitors from a single gym, but O'Keefe was still hoping her trio can deliver on the night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're still going to try. I don't want to give back that trophy," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They've been training hard for at least 12 weeks."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their leading hope will again be <strong>Michaela Sullenberger </strong>(former WHS student), who is out to retain her Ms Manawatu/Wanganui Shape crown.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Last year, <strong>Sullenberger</strong> won the most competitive division in Women's Novice Shape, going up against seven other entries, and was then judged overall best when lining up against the Open Shape entrants.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Revitalise's Taihape member Fiona Blyth won the Open Physique Women Short prize after six months preparation, and will be looking to do so again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The gym's newcomer is Leane Bird, also from Taihape, and she will be entering her first competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All three have been through the usual O'Keefe crash-court diet with their training, and so will be looking forward to the afterparty at event sponsor Mint Cafe &amp; Bar to finally get some guilty pleasure food.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bodybuilders will check in between 9-10am this morning before briefing, then get ready for the judging show at 12pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They will return for the Evening Show at 5pm, during which the winners will be announced.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The public can watch the midday show for $15 and the evening event for $25, door sales and eftpos are available.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Top prize winners will qualify for the NZ Nationals in October.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Roll of Honour</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Previous Top Gym winners were &ndash; 2013 City Fitness (Whanganui); 2014 Rangitikei Active Gym (Marton); 2015 Rangitikei Active Gym (Marton); 2016 Snap Fitness (Palmerston North); 2017 City Fitness (Palmerston North); 2018 Revitalise Health &amp; Fitness (Whanganui).</p>
