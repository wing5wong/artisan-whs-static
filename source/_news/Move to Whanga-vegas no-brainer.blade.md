<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Migrating to Whanganui to begin a career in law was a no-brainer for Armstrong Barton's latest recruits.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Law graduates, 24-year-old Nick Robertson and 27-year-old Rebecca Hay, say they are right where they want to be - working in a provincial close-knit town helping people.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nick, a Whanganui returnee, has spent the past two years in property and conveyancing law.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The great thing about law is that there are so many different areas you can go into, it's just working out what's best for you."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The former Whanganui High School student said it was in his last year of secondary school that he decided to become a lawyer.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Originally I wanted to get into the police force, but my father's a lawyer and he's been my biggest role model so eventually I opted for law instead."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nick graduated from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor of Law in 2015. It wasn't long after that he moved back to his hometown to take a job with law firm Armstrong Barton, where his father is a partner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nick said the most challenging part of his job was being chucked in the deep end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Going from uni where everything is in theory to putting everything you've learnt to practice is a jump.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Things get thrown at you and sometimes you don't know the answer but you gradually build up the knowledge," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rebecca, a Whanga-newbie, moved here six weeks ago with her partner, who is Whanganui born and raised, and has immersed herself in family law.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For me, it's the type of law that suits my interests. I like working face-to-face with people and making a real difference in their lives."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Before taking the job with Armstrong Barton, she worked at Cooper Legal in Wellington for four years doing historic abuse claims.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I loved that job so I decided I wanted to carry on in that area."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But the Invercargill-born lawyer admitted law wasn't the first career path she considered.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I thought about becoming a flight attendant, an actress, an interior designer, a journalist, even a forensic scientist after becoming addicted to&nbsp;<em>CSI.</em>"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She didn't get into law the first time round but getting knocked back made her realise how badly she wanted to become a lawyer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Maybe it was my stubbornness that made me all the more determined."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hard work paid off when she graduated from the University of Otago with a double degree in law and politics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To students considering a career in law, Rebecca said, "Just do it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It can take a while to work out what kind of law suits you. I was lucky to find my niche in my first job. Some of my friends have hated their first job but after moving to a different area in law love it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To students unsure what career path to take, Nick said, "Take your time."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's no rush. Don't dive into something you're unsure about, you're young, there's plenty of time."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both lawyers plan to grow their career within Armstrong Barton in Whanganui.</p>
