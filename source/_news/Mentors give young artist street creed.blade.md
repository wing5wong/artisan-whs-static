<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />When she was a young girl, Merle Chant used to spend her lunchtimes trying to teach other Whanganui Intermediate School students about design.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Together with her friend Imogen Maguire, they created The Cherry Club, complete with little membership cards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant says that they were always known as the art kids.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It wasn't really design. We didn't properly understand the concept, but we'd sit down and come up with stories and we'd make up creatures.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was really just our sisters and their friends that would come through our design club, we would have them come under our stead."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant sits on a camping chair, eyes cast skyward to a figure standing on a raised platform holding what looks like a broomstick with a paintbrush on the end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hayley Welsh is painting black around the outline of a sketch she has designed on the discoloured bricks of the former Phoenix Wine and Spirit Co Ltd building.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now the home of the Embassy 3 cinema, the brick building with criss-crossing lines of cement is getting a makeover as a part of the Whanganui Walls Street Art Festival.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh is one of eight international artists involved in the event and Chant is one of seven students participating in a Youth Mentor Programme to be carried out during it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant jumped at the opportunity to take part in it as she had been thinking more and more about her art and future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Being taught by Hayley for the next weekend is very exciting. I'm going to develop as an artist in a lot of different ways that I'm finding hard to do on my own," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Part of the reason I'm doing the programme is to get out of my comfort zone so I can grow. I'm big on comfort zones, I like to stay in my bubble which is not good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Youth Mentor Programme was created by Whanganui &amp; Partners and Whanganui Walls Street Art Festival organisers Shanti Sibbing and Simon Ormerod.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Throughout the programme, Chant will chat with Welsh, observe her processes and participate in the creation of collaborative street art with the other mentorees.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant was born in Scotland and came to New Zealand with her parents Murray Chant and Alex Ferretti when she was about six months old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She attended St John's Hill School before moving on to Intermediate, where specialised art classes with teacher Kaye Coombs really cemented her love for art.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, she took a long time to get there and there was a lot of trial and error beforehand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I used to do a few things when I was younger, like I tried ballet. I did not like ballet, so I quit. Dancing's not my thing," Chant says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was just my only thing at the time, so I didn't have anything to compare it to and when I tried fencing and archery I thought they were fun."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Outside of art, the 16-year-old does classics and debating at Whanganui High School where her sister Hazel is also attending.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the early stages of her time there, Chant was reunited with her Intermediate teacher Coombs in the art department.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant says that she was chuffed when Coombs made the move.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's very lovely and very good at what she does. I'm doing design with her. She'll come over and check on what you're doing and she's incredibly encouraging.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's always very complimentary, which does help. I'm a sucker for compliments."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh uses controls to descend from the cherry picker giving her access high up the wall and hops off the platform at the bottom.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She immediately approaches Chant and volunteer Hannah Sheridan, greeting them both and noting a clear folder in Chant's hands.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's a portfolio of her work, which she nervously hands over to her mentor, bursting her own bubble.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I do a lot of my drawings in sketch books. I'm very private about what I do and even though a lot of my friends recognise that I like art, I don't let people go through my work," Chant says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I consider it very personal, almost like a diary. If I'm going to get my art out there and work in the industry or do it as a hobby in my future, I need to start presenting it to people."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh smiles looking over Chant's designs and flipping through the pages.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Wow, you're really talented," the mentor tells the mentoree.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Just one day after meeting at Bedford Ave, the two are engaged in conversation, Welsh sharing advice while Chant explains the inspiration behind her work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant was unfamiliar with the work of Welsh before the festival, but upon discovering that she was going to be a part of it, she did her research.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said Welsh's work is very neat and it instantly reminded her of some of the work done by her favourite artists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chant was so inspired by what she saw that when she was asked who she would like to be paired up with, she suggested Welsh and it was agreed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hayley has been really friendly and kind. She hugged me before we left Bedford the other day. She's funny and I really like her process.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think we're going to get along well."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">When travelling along Whanganui's Victoria Ave, you could be forgiven for missing a narrow alleyway between Georges Fisheries and the Embassy 3 cinema.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A walk down it results in moss-covered shoes as you pass by smashed glass window panes and graffitied walls, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Upon exiting, foot traffic was once greeted by bland old building walls, but are now treated to the visual delights left behind by international street artists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The first works seen are by Pat Perry and Jacob Chrisohoou, but travelling from the Taupo Quay entrance, you will first see the creation of Hayley Welsh.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh stands in front of her black and white, grey-tinged creatures as workers remove a cherry picker from her site.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A photographer arrives, so she asks if they can please move a bright orange skip bin away from her piece that she worked on for four days after months of planning.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh has been an artist for over 10 years and for five years she has been travelling the world to places like New York, Lisbon and Berlin doing street art.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, Whanganui is the first place that presented her with the opportunity to mentor someone during her creative process.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh says that it was a beautiful experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I was Merle's age, I'd never met an artist before and I actually didn't meet another artist until I was one," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Her youth and purity, the fact that she's just starting up reminded me of where I came from and to stay focused on what I want to do.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I feel I got as much from Merle as she maybe got from me. It was really beautiful to show her techniques I've learned, but also just to spend time with someone passionate."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh was born in Blackburn, England and moved to Perth, Australia in 2009 because she liked the idea of travelling and fell in love with the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her parents always wanted the best for her, but suggested that she take traditional professional routes growing up, such as getting into accounting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh worked many jobs in her younger years, but found that none of them ever brought her any happiness.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That all changed when she began taking on the advice of her grandad, George Welsh.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">George Welsh worked many different jobs including being a coal miner and a bus conductor.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although none of his jobs were creative, Hayley's birthday cards would always come with a poem and some words of wisdom.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He had one regular saying in particular that still influences Welsh to this day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's better to be at the bottom of a ladder you want to climb than halfway up one you don't want to be on," George would say.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After a few miserable jobs, believing herself to be no good at sports and maybe even a little clumsy, Welsh finally pursued her dreams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I said I wanted to be an artist when I was Merle's age it was like saying I wanted to be a tooth fairy. It didn't really exist," Welsh says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Grandad always believed that I would be an artist when I grew up, even when everybody thought that it wasn't a real career path."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">George presented all of his granddaughter's paintings in his space at an old folks home and would explain what they all meant when he had visitors come around.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since he passed away, Welsh remains motivated to do what she said she would and what her granddad always told her to do.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I look back, I think the little creatures that appear in my work might have a little bit of him in them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My family that knew him say to me 'whenever I look at your piece I think of your grandad', so it's nice to know that I'm keeping his message alive through my artwork."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh went on to study scientific and natural history illustration at the Blackpool College of Arts and now does a combination of studio-based work and street art.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She had her first crack at street art when doing a gallery show in Australia and the project organiser suggested she should paint the outside of the gallery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh did it and never looked back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She says she has always enjoyed working on objects that she has found.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have never really enjoyed working on pieces of paper. Even in the studio before doing walls I collected bits of wood, road signs, any kind of surface that added a bit of history.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It gets me out and about and working on a different scale. It's a lot more physical. It's like dancing with a paintbrush rather than sitting down at my easel."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh got so into street art that she created her own event, Blackburn Open Walls Street Art Festival which she invited Simon Ormerod of Cracked Ink to one year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ormerod returned the favour, inviting Welsh to Whanganui Walls where it wasn't just Chant that was doing the learning.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh says the cherry picker proved tricky due to a lack of movement.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It meant that I could only work on one side, so the face was almost finished first, but that ended up being really nice because people could see what it was and engage with this creature as it grew.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was kind of this life with the eye of it from day one which the community engaged with and it was a nice way of working. I think I might even bring it to my work in the future."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh's design is of a creature shaped like a fish being ridden by another unique creature on top of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She often brings to life fluffy characters with her whimsical work that regularly reflects where she is at in life.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The inspirations behind the piece were its closeness to the Whanganui River and also the events of Christchurch on March 15, 2019 when 50 people were shot dead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Welsh says that she wanted the piece to be about togetherness.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You've got two different species here that don't have an age, that don't have a race, that don't have a sex and are very much a reflection of whoever's looking at them," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I want them to be open for everyone."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Below it, Welsh has painted a quote, a nod to grandad George and his way with words.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are the river, the river is us," it says.</p>
