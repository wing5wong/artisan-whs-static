<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>With youth representation in Whanganui up for review,&nbsp;Zaryd Wilson&nbsp;heads along to a Whanganui District Council youth committee meeting and talks to those involved.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The game is simple.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Everyone stands in a circle and when a name is called out that person must duck before the people either side of them can "shoot" them by raising their hand and yelling "bang".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Once the game is over, everyone takes turns to tell the others what they did that they were proud of.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is a bit of whimsy to start the June meeting of Whanganui District Council's youth committee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Forty minutes later, though, playtime is over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some youth councillors, committee administrator Claudia Perkins says, haven't been pulling their weight in working groups and it's been brought to her attention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That is absolutely not acceptable and it's not fair," Perkins says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"[The youth committee] is not just sitting here around the table, it's about really supporting our youth here in Whanganui and we need to reflect that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Tasks have been allocated to people and tasks have been absolutely ignored which is not fair on the group and it will reflect badly on the committee."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School student and committee co-chair Ara Molijn joins the call.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Because there's nothing worse than looking through a chat that has 15 people on it and having only three people at a meeting".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">You could walk into a youth committee meeting at different times and get a completely different impression of what it is about. That is essentially the nub of what is being debated now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">What is the role of the youth committee? What is its purpose? And how best does it represent and improve the lives of young people in Whanganui?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The question has been hanging over the committee since its budget was hotly debated by the district council in 2017.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The budget ended up being slashed from $45,000 to $25,00 and out of that smaller pot the youth committee had to hire an administrator for eight hours a week, having lost its staff support which had been coming out of council budgets.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Mayor Hamish McDouall laid down the gauntlet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youth committee needed to be relevant and the youth councillors' desire needed to be to represent the youth of the district.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's not [just] something to put on your CV," he said at the time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The colour run - nice idea, but is that really going to be addressing the substantial issue of bullying throughout our schools?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A year on, the youth committee's budget has been restored to $45,000 but with the condition it is reviewed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The review working party includes five district councillors - McDouall and four others - alongside council staff and youth committee co-chairs <strong>Ara Molijn and Rhea Colaabavala.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Obviously, we wouldn't like to have a review because in a sense it's easy to see a review in a negative light because it's almost like we're not doing the role that council envisaged us to do," <strong>Rhea </strong>says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But for me I see it as a good thing because we can really address any issues we see and it's an opportunity for us to grow and make things better."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ara</strong> is just as pragmatic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's also a really good way to get some communication between what the expectations are, how we're meeting those expectations and what both sides can do better to really support a better youth committee," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A disconnect between the youth committee and the council is the first thing that's been identified by the review.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A "meet the councillors" event is being held this week to bring the youth councillors and district councillors together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The review puts everything on the table including the number of councillors, whether the committee structure is the right approach, alternative funding, and whether it is advocating for the right things.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youth committee currently comprises 18 people between the ages of 12 and 24. Members are appointed after going through an application process.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Josh Chandulal-Mackay, who is part of the review, has a deeper insight than most as the second former youth councillor to have gone on to be elected to the full district council. The first was Jack Bullock.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He still sits on the youth committee as the appointed district councillor and is an advocate for its place in Iocal government.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As a 12-year-old, Chandulal-Mackay shook as he read the declaration in front of councillors as part of his swearing in.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was so intimidating because at that stage even a 14- or 15-year-old seems miles ahead of you in terms of their ability to articulate a viewpoint and contribute. I felt like a bit of a benchwarmer for a couple of years."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But he credits the youth committee with his development.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's got a huge part to play and it's that kind of environment that I think creates enthusiasm for local government among younger people &ndash; the fact that they are empowered to do stuff on their own and that it's not just a talk fest."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chandulal-Mackay says that is because the youth committee is an official, legitimate committee of the Whanganui District Council.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has six-weekly meetings. Meetings follow council standing orders. It has a budget which it is accountable for. Co-chairs report to each district council meeting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youth committee has a representative on the Rural Community Board and two appointees to the YMCA board.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />This month, youth councillor <strong>Emelye Brown</strong> joined councillors and staff on a trip to Rotorua to see how the city's recycling programmes work and what ideas could be brought back to Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's pretty substantial stuff and that sets it apart from many other committees around New Zealand," Chandulal-Mackay says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's advocacy. And alongside that I think a natural part of advocacy is creating opportunities for young people to come together and actually feel part of the community and I think that's where the events side of things come together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's this perception that all the committee does is have their six weekly meeting and that's it."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />The youth committee tries to tie its events to serious issues affecting youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Vibe music festival was about getting people talking about mental health. The Castlecliff Beach clean-up was about the environment. The colour run was about bullying.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Rhea</strong> says some of the feedback they get from the council is the youth committee isn't just supposed to organise events; it needs to be tackling issues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"And I do get what they mean but to address really important issues like mental health and environmental issues - the best way is to ask youth to get directly involved and bring that issue to the forefront of their mind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A lot of people think we're kind of a mini council because I guess the venue is the council chamber but I don't see us as that as all."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ara</strong> says: "We are youth, we're not trying to do what council does."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chandulal-Mackay says the expectations put on the youth committee need to be realistic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Take the issue of youth suicide - you've got some of the most brilliant, experience and empathetic minds in the world grappling with this issue and we've got a country that has the highest rates of suicide between 15- and 19-year-olds in the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yes, the youth committee should be playing a role in this space but to expect them to make some kind of substantial change when so many others haven't managed to - I think is a hell of a burden to be placing on a bunch of young people between the age of 12 and 24."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chandulal-Mackay there's nothing wrong with youth councillors' personal development being part of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Vibe festival was an example.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It provides something spectacular for the community, but we had an event manager, <strong>Josie Verhaaren</strong>, who was 16 at the time, and she basically coordinated everything and was the real driver of this project along with <strong>Ahilan Saravanapavan</strong>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"How many 16-year-olds can say that at the end of Year 12 they've managed and coordinated a community event?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The committee allowed her to develop the capacity to do that in a way school never could."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Chandulal-Mackay says it's become clear the engagement between the committee and council is "pretty insufficient" but the review will help.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I would like to have a really thorough discussion about how the youth committee could be more effective in that space and I'd really like to test the intellect of the other elected members about how they see the committee doing that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Back at the youth committee meeting, <strong>Helena Hazlehurst's</strong> resignation letter has been accepted and new youth councillor Christie Wallace has been sworn in by Mayor Hamish McDouall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He gives a speech about empathy which kind of reveals what he sees as the role of the youth committee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sometimes it's a bit hard to open your mind and envisage the experience of others," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Empathy is this thing. Don't worry about youth councillor being on your CV. Worry about the word empathy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are, after all, a species that bands together, that's why there's a community, that's why there's a district here. We're not lone wolves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I hope you can use your collective empathy to understand some of those young people out there who may be do not have the time, space of safety &hellip; to allow them to empathise.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is your job. My hope is that you'll be able to transmit through that empathy to us what the youth in Whanganui are experiencing and how best to react to it."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Really, the council and the youth committee agree on its role and the current discussion and review is just about how best to do that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think it's just really important for people to know that we're here and we'll listen," Ara says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Don't be afraid to approach us if there's something you want to see changed in Whanganui. We can help to make that happen."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There's nothing whimsical about it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The official things like passing resolutions and voting and stuff &ndash; that's just kind of management &ndash; but really at the heart of it we are just youth trying to make a difference and make change," <strong>Rhea</strong> says.</p>
