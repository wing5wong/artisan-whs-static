<p><br />Women's Refuge Whanganui has benefitted from a fundraising house competition at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p>The high school's houses Moana, Maunga, Whenua and Awa collected two cars full of cans and toiletries for the women's organisation on Ingestre St.</p>
<p>Moana came out on top, collecting about 400 items.</p>
<p>The competition was organised by heads of community Candice Clark and Helena Hazelhurst.</p>
<p>"In previous years we have collected cans, but nothing on this scale and it wasn't a house competition before this year," Hazelhurst said.</p>
<p>"I was really impressed with how much we collected."</p>
<p>Hazelhurst, 17, estimated that about 1000 items had been collected overall and they covered the space of one room.</p>
<p>For the competitive element, each can collected earned a house one point and each toiletry was worth two.</p>
<p>Hazelhurst said the Women's Refuge Whanganui loved their effort.</p>
<p>"They were a little bit shocked because we had two whole car loads full of things to give them. It was a little bit of a laugh to see their reaction.</p>
<p>"We just wanted to donate to something that was local and something that we felt would have an impact on our community."</p>
<p>Hazelhurst said that the school now has a winning formula and hopes the fundraising competition will continue long after she leaves.</p>
