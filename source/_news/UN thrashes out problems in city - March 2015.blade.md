<p><span>Congratulations to Wanganui High School students Alister Hughes and Tim Rowe who were top speakers at MUNS and Ben Clow who received Merit.</span></p>
<p><span>A "United Nations General Assembly" made up of students from six colleges throughout the Wanganui region debated world issues at Wanganui Girls' College.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Senior students in teams of three represented the UN member states. The schools were Wanganui High School, Wanganui Collegiate, Wanganui City College, Wanganui Girls' College, Nga Tawa and Cullinane College.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>The teams dressed in the native costume or flag colours of the country they represented.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>A special assembly on Friday ran from 10am to 2.30pm and the member nations voted on three resolutions:&nbsp;</span><br /><span>- Should Libya stay on the UN's Human Rights Council.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>- The environmental legacy of war.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>- Guidelines on the peaceful use of outer space.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Earlier, a member from each team introduced their country with a description of what was unique about it and its people.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Wanganui High School's head of history Mary-Ann Ewing, vice-president of the Wanganui Association of the UN, which organised the "model" United Nations Assembly, said: "It is a great day for the students."&nbsp;</span><br /><span>And given the recent publicity about students and bullying, it was an excellent opportunity to show people there were a lot of capable young people in schools.&nbsp;</span><br /><span>"Students who are credit to themselves, their parents and their schools," she said.</span></p>
