<p><br />Whanganui High School cooking representatives came so close to winning the recent regional cooking competitions in Taranaki and representing the region at the National competitions later in the year, missing out by only 0.3 of a mark. It will be a mathematical statistic that they will probably dislike for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The High School team won the event last year and with a number of year 12 students returning next year, t</span><span class="text_exposed_show">hey will be back there trying to reclaim their title. HoD Linda Hardcastle says, &ldquo;The competition is getting tougher every year.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>The team brought home one gold, three silver, eight bronze and four merits. They were as follows:</strong><br /><br />&bull; <strong>Gold</strong>: Olea Drummond.<br />&bull; <strong>Silver</strong>: Andrew Wong, Britney Walsh and Kelahn Te Awhe.<br />&bull; <strong>Bronze</strong>: Andrew and Kelahn for cheesecake and cupcake sections, Olea for cheesecake, Caitlyn Butlin and Glachyus Quennell-Taia for cupcakes. Glachyus also received a bronze for omelettes and was also winner of his class.<br />&bull; <strong>Merit</strong>: Caitlyn and Glachyus for cheesecake and Olea and Britney for cupcake.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">High School is planning to convert part of a cooking class into a small commercial kitchen. This will allow them to do more practical level 3 assessments.</span></p>
