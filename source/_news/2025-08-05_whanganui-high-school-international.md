🌸 Sayonara, Namiki High School! 🇯🇵💫

This morning we farewelled our wonderful visitors from Namiki High School, who have spent the past week with us at Whanganui High School.

At yesterday’s farewell celebration in the library, the students shared the traditional Soran Bushi dance with their WHS buddies — a fun and energetic way to end an unforgettable week of cultural exchange and new friendships.

Thank you for bringing your energy, kindness, and culture to our school. Safe travels home — we hope to see you again one day! 💚✈️🌏
