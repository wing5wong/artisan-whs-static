<p><br />Defending Netball Whanganui Premier A1 champions Kaiwhaiki continue to search for their top form despite a decisive 56-35 win over competition newcomers Kaierau A2 in the first game of round two on Monday night.</p>
<p>Former multiple champions Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau A1 also had a dominant 57-42 victory over Mere Te Aroha and like Kaiwhaiki have certainly not conceded to a <strong>sharp looking unbeaten</strong> <strong>Phillips Electrical Whanganui High School</strong> who had the bye on Monday.</p>
<p>Kaiwhaiki coach Te Rina Peina said her girls were still scrambling to hit their straps in the five-team competition, but with three more round robin games to play before the semifinals and finals was confident the winning groove would be found.</p>
<p>"We did win all four quarters against Kaierau A2 on Monday, but it still wasn't our greatest performance," Peina said.</p>
<p>"We have yet to hit our straps and we will need to soon with Kaierau A1 and WHS A1 to play in the coming weeks. I thought our captain Kahu Aki had an outstanding game leading from the front at centre. She had them chasing her all night."</p>
<p>Kaierau A1 coach Walter Edmonds was also concerned consistency was lacking throughout all four quarters.</p>
<p>"We haven't hit our stride yet and need consistency in all four quarters. We ended with a good win and while ours is a relatively new team we have been able to bring in players with experience and that counted," Edmonds said.</p>
<p>"I thought MTA had a good game and their defence took a lot of ball off us, it was just their execution that let them down."</p>
<p>Edmonds singled out Rebecca Alabaster for praise in making a solid transition from goal attack to goal shoot and Kataraina Hakaraia for her performances at both centre and wing attack during Monday's contest.</p>
<p>Neither winning coach on Monday have conceded to a slick-looking unbeaten WHS A1.</p>
<p>"We should have beaten them in round one," Edmonds said.</p>
<p>"We were up by five with five minutes to go and ended up losing by just two - we'll be gunning for them."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>WHS A1</strong> <strong>continued their winning run</strong> <strong>in the Manawatu Secondary Schools A1 grade Saturday competition</strong> with a 45-43 win over Manukura Red in Palmerston North in a catch-up game on Monday made possible by a bye in the Whanganui championship.</p>
