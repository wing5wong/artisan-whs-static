<p>They're about to have a spot on Maori Television - but Whanganui reggae band Cool Meditation see themselves at Ragamuffin next.</p>
<p>Their television debut is on Friday night at 9.30pm, in the My Reggae Song series.</p>
<p>They are big fans of House of Shem, Katchafire, 1814 and Bob Marley. The band would like to be playing at top New Zealand reggae events in the next few years, or even overseas.</p>
<p>Backing vocalist and percussionist Luke Whanarere and his sister Te Oranga (vocals) are two members. Practices are on Thursdays at Mr Whanarere's Wanganui house.</p>
<p>Some of the members have to travel to get there - they are spread up the Whanganui River and into Raetihi. Most of them have jobs, and at one time they were all at Imlay meat works.</p>
<p>The band comprises two guitarists, a bass guitarist, two keyboard players and a drummer.</p>
<p>Rodney Tetawhero is lead vocalist, and one of the guitarists.</p>
<p>He also writes most of the songs, including Hammer Down, which they will sing on TV. It's about getting a hard time at work, and being judged in the wrong way, Mr Whanarere said.</p>
<p>The group plays a range of styles, from upbeat to rootsy. They have just released two singles on iTunes, Love and Thinking of You.</p>
<p>Cool Meditation has played gigs in Hawke's Bay and Marton, as well as at 21st birthday parties and Stellar Restaurant &amp; Bar in Wanganui. "We like to get people dancing. That's the plan. We try and pick songs where the crowd's not going to go to sleep on you." Mr Whanarere said none of the group had had formal music lessons. "The boys are just gifted with their music."</p>
