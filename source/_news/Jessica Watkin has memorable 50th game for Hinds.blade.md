<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin finished with 1-37 from her ten overs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Opening with fellow White Fern Natalie Dodd (26), Watkin scored 43 from 49 balls as part of a 60-run partnership, hitting seven boundaries.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She was denied a half century when Roz McNeill had her trapped in front in the 14th over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Hinds went on to win the game by six wickets, reaching 200-4 in the 47th over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former Wanganui Women's captain Esther Lanser was unbeaten on 13 from 19 balls.</p>
