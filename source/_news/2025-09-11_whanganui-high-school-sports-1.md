The WHS Motocross team recently took part in the Yamaha North Island Secondary Schools Cross Country event. It was awesome to see 8 riders representing our school at the Taikorea track, alongside about 200 riders on the day. The weather made things pretty tough, with heavy rain and even thunder and lightning for some riders waiting on the start line. All of our riders managed to get through a tricky sand course, made up of laps that took them around the MX track and then out into the pine trees. Parents and supporters also had some tough calls to make, deciding whether to refuel or let their riders try for another lap on the tank.
