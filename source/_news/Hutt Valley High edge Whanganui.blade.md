<p class="element element-paragraph">Basketball gave visitors Hutt Valley High School the edge over Whanganui High School in their annual traditional interschool sports day on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS played host this year for a tournament that has been on the calendar for the past nine years invlolving six sporting codes for both male and female athletes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS sport co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said this year Hutt Valley High won six exchanges to WHS' four with the two drawing 2-all in the girls' 2nd X1 hockey match-up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had six different sports playing in the exchange, with a boys and girls team from each sport, except rugby and netball. Hutt Valley won 6 games, WHS won 4 and we drew 1," Murphy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hutt Valley over the years has been very strong in basketball and still are today."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That proved the difference betwen the two schools with Hutt Valley winning both the boys and girls encounters by wide margins.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Murphy, as coach of the Phillips Electrical WHS A1 netball team that plays in the Whanganui premier competition, got some revenge with her girls dismissing the visitors 49-24.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHS 1st XV rugby side drew away for a 31-24 win over their Hutt Valley High counterparts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHS boys 1st X1 hockey team also proved far too strong winning 4-nil.</p>
