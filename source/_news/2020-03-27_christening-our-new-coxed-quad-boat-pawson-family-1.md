Great day last Saturday at the Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club christening our new coxed quad boat.

AWRC and WHS Rowing Clubs together purchased a new quad for our WHS rowers to use.

The boat is named ‘Pawson Family’. Ken and Annie Pawson along with sons Gus and Hugh have been a huge part of WHS and AWRC rowing over many years. 

It was a great way to show our appreciation of their hard work they have done and still do for rowing 😊 Congrats Pawson’s 🎉🎉

Unfortunately the first regatta to use it was going to be Maadi Cup next week, but this will have to wait until next season!! 😢

A HUGE thank you to NZCT and Four Regions Trust for supporting us in this! 👏👏👍❤️💛 💛💚
