Three key players in the national rugby league under-20 series-leading Central Districts Under-20 team are itching to perform in front of a home crowd at Cooks Gardens in Whanganui on Sunday, March 28.

Brooklyn Herewini, Kayin Katene and **Tipene Reweti** are all Whanganui-born and bred and have been a major force in the team's four matches this season. Katene in jersey 9, Herewini jersey 7 and Reweti No6, after beginning in the No1 strip, have helped the side through to wins against Northland (56-6), South Island (32-30) and Auckland White (26-24). The only loss has been to a strong Auckland Blue team (34-18).

Central Districts U20 lead the standings after four games, although some of the others in the competition have games in hand. Four of the team feature in the top 10 of the MVP standings.

All games in the competition are televised live on Sky Sport 4, as well as Fox League, Kayo and Watch NRL for Australian viewers.

Mid Central Zone Rugby League general manager Lisa Reweti said Sunday's clash against Bay Of Plenty side Wai-Coa-Bay was a pivotal game in the competition and the east coasters would be no easy beats.

Wai-Coa-Bay emerged 56-12 winners over Northland in round 3 of the NZRL National 20s competition.

"The match will be televised live on Sky Sport 4 and will also air in Australia where there will no doubt be talent scouts watching," Reweti said.

"Some players in the competition have already been approached by NRL representatives, so there is serious potential at stake for some of these young players.

"I know the Whanganui boys are hanging out to play on home soil too and Cooks Gardens is an ideal place to showcase their talents. The match kicks off at 12 noon, but between 9am and 11am the Warriors and NZRL staff will be hosting a rugby league roadshow aimed at 5 to 12-year-olds.

"There will be giveaways, spot prizes, games, skills and drills and Kiwi Tag during the session. I hear former Kiwi Reuben Wiki will also make an appearance. Many of the stars from the past, including Tony Kemp and Graham West are making themselves available for these roadshows."
