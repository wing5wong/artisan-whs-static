Teacher, Kate Cvitanovich (former WHS student) and representatives from her class of year 5 and 6 students from Mosston School, were at the Cancer Society’s annual Volunteer luncheon recently. They were there to be honoured for raising $1800 for the cause.

Kate explains how it happened. “Earlier this year I signed my class up for a Student Volunteer Army project run through the School Kit organisation. It centred on the essential question – ‘Can young people plan and carry out a service project without adult supervision?’

“It very quickly became evident that there was a project that was very important to us. We have had two children in our class who have had parents bravely battling cancer. The class decided that this was a fantastic chance for us to support them and others going through the same challenges. They opted to fundraise money by holding a Walk-a-thon, modelled on the Relay for Life event.

“The students organised the entire day: the walking course, an entertainment area, HQ and first aid, a food tent, shade gazebos, a sausage sizzle lunch for the school and prizes. We had communications officers emailing the Cancer Society to plan the event, caterers planning the menu, ordering food and preparing it on the day, finance officers managing the budget and sponsorship and safety officers ensuring everyone was sage and healthy on the day. We had students who were equipment officers organising gazebos, sunscreen poles and BBQs.”

The event took place on November 24 with the walk starting at 9am, finishing at 3pm with one team member walking at all times. Having organised themselves into teams of three, this meant two hours of walking each. When not walking there was the ‘Entertainment’ tent, the ‘Chillout’ tent and the ‘Food’ tent – all managed by the students. Prior to the event the students organised sponsorship for walking.
As well as raising $1800 the students also learnt a lot about organising events, how to fundraise and how to choose effective projects – not to mention learning a lot of maths and literacy.

But as Kate sums up, “Most importantly, it provided us with a very powerful opportunity to offer support to both our class community and other Whanganui families in need.”

The group were given certificates and the thanks of the Cancer Society.
