🇪🇸 WHS SPAIN TRIP 🇪🇸



After a slight email glitch here is Day 1 and 2 of our Spain adventures:



Day #1 Whanganui-Madrid 🎉✈️😉☀️😍🎉🎉



Day #2 Madrid ☀️😊😍😉☀️

We are a bit tired from the looong trip, but everyone is doing amazing 😘🎉 We enjoyed the city, the Royal Palace, the great art in the big museums here, and we visited one of the ⚽️ icons in town.
