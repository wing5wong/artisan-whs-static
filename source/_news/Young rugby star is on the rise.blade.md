<p>The New Zealand Sevens rugby team may not be top dogs in the international series this year but the squad has one of the most talked about young stars on the circuit - Wanganui High School-educated Vilimoni Koroi.</p>
<p><strong>The 18-year-old play maker has received rave media mention from experienced TV commentators at almost every hosting venue on the 2017 world circuit.</strong></p>
<p>To the forefront in his development since exploding on to the sevens scene are two former Wanganui representative loan players, Tomasi Cama (current co-coach of the national squad) and Tony Philp (NZRU high performances sevens manager).</p>
<p>Cama, who holds the world seven points scoring record, played three times for Wanganui in 2004 as a loan player from COB (PN), and Philp had 18 matches for Wanganui in 1998 as a loan member from Manawatu and 1999 when playing for Pourewa (Rangitikei).</p>
<p>The selection of Koroi in the national squad when he was fresh out of Feilding AG High School, had not played in any union senior or sevens rep squad and had just been snapped up by the Otago Development School, came as a major surprise in New Zealand rugby.</p>
<p>Wanganui-born Vilimoni Koroi, a member of a rugby family - his older brother Api scored 145 points for Kaierau in 2010 before switching to Manawatu - has scored a few thrilling solo tries, pulled off several try-saving tackles and featured in some enterprising back movements on the current international circuit.</p>
<p>His individual play has been lauded by commentators around the world, predicting a bright rugby future for the teenager.</p>
<p>Cama, who lives in Manawatu, had been keeping a close eye on the young Koroi and tracking his progress before his shock inclusion in the national squad.</p>
<p>Koroi has made a few mistakes this season but these have been far outweighed by some individual brilliance and Cama has high hopes that NZ Sevens has come up with a new rising star.</p>
<p>New Zealand's incoming Sevens coach, Scottish-born Clark Laidlaw, who takes over the coaching reins in June after his brief stint with London Irish ends, has naturally been following the progress of the national squad.</p>
<p>The former Scottish Sevens international who played in the 2006 Commonwealth Games, has coached in Taranaki and Wellington including three years as assistant Hurricanes coach.</p>
<p>When named to replace retiring veteran Gordon Tietjens as NZ Sevens coach Laidlaw said it was important that young players are found to help mould a squad for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>On his form in recent months it appears that Vilimoni Koroi fits perfectly into the futures vision for the new national coach.</p>
<p>In the meantime Cama and Philp will be helping to mould the career of the Wanganui teenager who has already temporarily put on hold plans for a builders' apprenticeship in Otago to concentrate on his rugby.</p>
<p>There is a suggestion that Koroi could be drafted into the Otago squad for the Mitre 10 national 15-a-side championship campaign later this season and then reassigned to the NZ Sevens squad.</p>
<p>Kaierau has produced numerous Wanganui representative players over the years and one of the best loose forwards was Laurie Penn who has died at the age of 82.</p>
<p>During the height of his playing career he played 25 times for Wanganui between 1958 and 1964 including twice against touring Australian sides on Spriggens Park and was in three Wanganui Ranfurly Shield challenging teams including the memorable last minute 14-12 loss to Taranaki in 1963 at New Plymouth.</p>
<p>The Butcher Boys led Ferdinand 12-11 with time showing on the clock but Taranaki salvaged a shield retaining try when Wanganui's Colin Pierce attempted a quick drop-out.</p>
<p>The touch judge could not confirm whether the ball had crossed the sideline because of the excited crowd of spectators, the referee ruled a scrum back on the 22 metre line, and the hosts snatched the game to break the hearts of the Wanganui players and supporters.</p>
<p>Penn was one of three Wanganui loose forwards that day. Junior All Black Roger Green (Hunterville) was No 8 and Winston Caudwell (Marton Athletic) packed down on the side of the scrum.</p>
<p>They had also played in the 18-41 loss to Auckland that same season in a earlier shield challenge and Penn also played when Wanganui was beaten 22-9 by Taranaki in a 1958 shield challenge at Rugby Park.</p>
<p>Penn was in the Wanganui teams that lost to the touring Australians 11-9 in 1958 and 29-6 in 1962.</p>
<p>He scored a try in the 9-all draw against Taranaki in the 1963 Queen's Birthday Monday morning match at Spriggens Park, a few months before the dramatic shield clash in New Plymouth.</p>
<p>During his Wanganui appearances Penn at times played alongside fellow Kaierau rep backs Colin Pierce, Bryan Watson, Jackie Thompson, Harvey Carvell and Budge Lockett and forwards Colin Rodgers, Barry Dempsey, Geoff Byres, Cyril Tamati and Wally Williams.</p>
<p>Penn, who worked at the Eastown Workshops for many years, was a key member of winning Wanganui Cascade Cup Railway teams and was a Wanganui Metropolitan rep in annual sub-union fixtures against Northern Wanganui and Rangitikei which also served as rep trials.</p>
<p>He was a captain of the Kaierai senior side during the late 1950-early 1960 era when the club won the 1957 Wanganui championship and the 1960-61-63 Wanganui-Rangitikei combined titles plus the Metropolitan domestic Alex Takarangi Cup series.</p>
<p>Laurie Penn was a talented all-round sportsman, also representing Wanganui at lawn bowls (winning numerous centre titles), softball and rowing (being a finals trialist for Empire Games selection).</p>
<p>Waverley Harvesting Border has a first home defence of the Grand Hotel Challenge Shield when Black Bull Liquor Pirates visits Dallison Park on Saturday.</p>
<p>It will be a big challenge for Pirates who started the season with scratchy wins over Dave Hoskin Carriers Marist and Settlers Honey Ngamatapouri before going down - to PGG Wrightson/Balance Taihape last weekend.</p>
<p>It will also be a first away match for Pirates after enjoying the benefit of three home games at Spriggens Park.</p>
<p>Since the return of Border from Taranaki in 2011 the South Taranaki teams have won three of five home games against Pirates and in all 14 premier fixtures between over the past six seasons it is 8-6 to the city-siders.</p>
<p>The two clubs met each other three times during a season between 2012 and 2015, both qualifying for play-offs with Border winning 23-6 away in the 2012 semi-finals and Pirates winning home semis in 2013 and 2014 and the 2015 final 20-19 at Cooks Gardens.</p>
<p>There was only one clash last winter, Border scoring nine tries to three to retain the Grand Shield at Spriggens Park.</p>
<p>The challenge trophy is again at stake this weekend after Bordered lifted it 21-18 off McCarthy's Transport Ruapehu and defended it - against Utiku OB last Saturday.</p>
<p>To strike last year's two finalists on successive weekends is a big hurdle for Pirates. It will also be a testing day for Kaierau who are away to Taihape, a side that has not lost a home fixtures to the visitors since 2011.</p>
<p>It was 40-28 (away) and 43-15 (home) last year but Kaierau looks a stronger team than last season.</p>
<p>Marist is home to Ngamatapouri on the Racecourse, Ruapehu looks too strong for Utiku OB in Ohakune and Harvey Round Motors Ratana has the bye.</p>
<p>In the seniors Taihape has a home game against Kaierau with host fixtures for Border (v Black Bull Liquor Pirates) for the Challenge Sheild, Buffalos (v Kelso Hunterville at Spriggens Park) and Counties (v Speirs Food Marton). Ruapehu (default win from Utiku OB) and Celtic have byes.</p>
<p>After a shock 15-10 defeat on the same McNab Domain field last year Marton will be seeking revenge on Saturday.</p>
