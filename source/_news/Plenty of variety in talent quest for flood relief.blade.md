<p>Some of Wanganui's best young talent will be stage tonight in the Wanganui High School Hall for the Centre Stage 2015 talent quest.</p>
<p>Facilitator and former WHS student Kiri Wilson said the talent quest was a chance for local schools to do good in the community. Some of the proceeds from the show will be donated to local flood relief funds.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson said the show had been entirely put together by young people, and had started with the formation of a school leaders' network.</p>
<p>"The Wanganui District Council's youth committee organised the school leaders' network as a way of helping school leaders to get to know each other.</p>
<p>"They decided they wanted to do something for the community, and this is what they came up with."</p>
<p>Miss Wilson said schools were often quite competitive with each other but this was a way they could collaborate.</p>
<p>Each local secondary school has put up two acts for the show and, so far, 10 acts have been confirmed.</p>
<p>The acts include talent as varied as an a cappella group and a magic act.</p>
<p>The show was sponsored by the council's youth committee.</p>
<p>Miss Wilson said if the show was successful it was hoped it could become an annual event.</p>
<p>-Centre Stage 2015 will be held today at 6.30pm, at the Wanganui High School hall. Tickets available at the door for $5 per person.</p>
