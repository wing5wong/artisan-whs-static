Our Pasifika Group travelled to Palmerston North recently for Pasifika Fusion 2021.

Special recognition for Sophia â€˜Unga-Cribb for gaining second-place in the English Speech.

We entered Quiz, Speeches, Talent Quest and Cultural Set.

All students represented our School beautifully and were great ambassadors!

We have been invited to make some special performances next term at various local schools.

We were the only Whanganui School to enter in this Whanganui-Manawatu event. Ten schools entered. Palmerston North Girls were the overall winners.

We are looking forward to next year.

Special thank you to our tutors Marie Aki and former students, Montel Aki and Josefa Tamaniyaga.

Also, thank you to the parents and staff who helped make the trip possible.

*Mrs Tahuaroa  
Teacher in charge*
