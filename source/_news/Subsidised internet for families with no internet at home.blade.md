<p><br />Families with children up to 18 years old and with no current broadband connection at home are eligible to participate in the JUMP programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>JUMP is a not for profit and community driven programme which enables more children to go online outside of classroom hours and get on the right side of the digital divide. As classroom learning goes digital, students without broadband at home are at risk of being left behind.&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show"><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">JUMP provides a low-cost and easy plug-in-and-go solution for families with a free modem preloaded with 30GB. Top up vouchers are only $10 for 30GB and are available from supermarkets and service stations. This prepaid and contract-free service uses the Skinny network and provides &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; home broadband via a 4G mobile signal - thus no landline is required.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Families can easily check their eligibility and obtain one by contacting one of the libraries at Gonville, Davis Central City or Hakeke Street, or at Nga Tai o Te Awa, Ingestre Street. The sign-up process takes about 20 minutes and will not create any onerous obligations or financial risks for families.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Whanganui JUMP Ambassador, Alistair Fraser says, &ldquo;We know from the Census there are still many Whanganui families with no internet at home. Having no internet connection not only makes it harder for families to be successful, but it holds the whole community back. It would be great for everyone to take up the challenge to make us all online at home and to encourage families they know who are not to get JUMP.&rdquo;</span></p>
