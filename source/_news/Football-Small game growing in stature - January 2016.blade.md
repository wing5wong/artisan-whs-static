<p>Wanganui's Matt Stoneman (former WHS student) has just returned from refereeing at the Australian National Futsal Championships in Sydney.</p>
<p>Football referee Matt Stoneman has just returned from a week-long stint calling foul in Australia.</p>
<p>Stoneman was one of two New Zealand futsal referees invited to officiate at the Australian National Futsal Championships at Olympic Park Sports Centre in Sydney.</p>
<p>The five-aside indoor game has very similar rules to its outdoor cousin soccer, a game Stoneman knows well as both a player and referee.</p>
<p>Futsal is still very much in its infancy in New Zealand and has only been Fifa-sanctioned internationally since about 2010. It is a rapidly growing sport in Australia, particularly in New South Wales where they have club and state level leagues. The national competition is relatively new.</p>
<p>Stoneman has been refereeing futsal in the Manawatu league, the closest serious competition to his hometown.</p>
<p>"We do have a league of sorts here in Whanganui, but it's not affiliated yet. It is growing, though," Stoneman said.</p>
<p>"The closest proper league is in Palmerston North and I have been refereeing the sport over there. When New Zealand Football was asked to select two referees to officiate at the Australian Futsal Nationals, I was chosen along with Antony Riley from Palmerston North - a bit of an honour really.</p>
<p>"I've been reffing futsal for just over 18 months and enjoy it. It wasn't that much different in Australia, although they certainly play a different style," Stoneman said.</p>
<p>Known for their sledging in most sports and the competitive nature between Kiwi and Ocker was of no concern to Stoneman and his Manawatu offsider.</p>
<p>"No, there wasn't too much sledging and because we were wearing the Australian ref strips none of the players knew we were Kiwi unless we talked too much. They were fairly well behaved in the games we reffed."</p>
<p>The nationals were held in Sydney between January 4 and 8.</p>
<p>While his selection to the Australian futsal nationals was yet another feather in his cap, Stoneman still has an eye on the big time in the outdoor round ball game as.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old football referee is aiming at Fifa level after more than 12 years on the paddock, including seven years in Central League and a season controlling national league matches in 2012. He is still called on for national duties as an assistant referee (linesman), but aims to return to top level when he can.</p>
<p>Central Football referee development officer David Lawrie said both Stoneman and Riley were leaning more toward futsal.</p>
<p>"Antony already has his Fifa futsal referee badge and we nominated Matt last year, but he wasn't quite ready and didn't make it. He will be nominated again this year and I wouldn't be surprised if he gained the Fifa badge," Lawrie said.</p>
<p>"There are several pathways to gaining a Fifa badge with the outdoor game and futsal just two of them. Once you have a Fifa badge you can referee anywhere in the world. Both these guys did a great job in Australia. We have had great feedback on their performance and for them to be chosen to ref in the semifinals was fantastic."</p>
<p>Riley has been named to officiate at the Oceania futsal tournament next month.</p>
