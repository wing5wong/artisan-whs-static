<p><strong>ON A ROLL: Sporting a cast on her broken arm, Whanganui's Renee Teers was in excellent form to finish in a three-way tie for the cadet girls title at the Oceania Speed Skating Championships in Timaru over Easter Weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Whanganui masters skater Krystine Davies proved beyond all doubt that she is the top female masters skater in Australasia at the Oceania Speed Skating Championships in Timaru over Easter. Davies was unchallenged by New Zealand and Australian opposition to romp home with all six gold medals on offer and the overall title in the masters women.</p>
<p>A strong 42km marathon effort saw Davies finish among the masters men, despite starting 400m behind them, with a time only 97 seconds slower than the winner of that class.</p>
<p>In the masters men Dunedin's Brett McCormack had a tougher time of it against former world masters champion Michele Cicognani of Italy, but ultimately claimed the overall title.</p>
<p>Whanganui's <strong>Renee Teers</strong> battled all the way with Timaru competitors Elle Benson and Charlotte Clarke in the cadet girls grade with the skaters so evenly matched that all three ended up tied for the overall title. <strong>Each won two golds, two silvers and two bronze.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sporting a cast on a broken arm, Teers had a strong win in the 1000m, was narrowly beaten in the 5000m points, had a strong 300m time trial for silver and survived a photo-finish to win the 21km half marathon. It finishes a strong season for Teers who won titles at all the championships she contested.</strong></p>
<p>Former WHS student Eden Smith had the toughest task in the junior boys grade where the Australians fielded a team of class skaters who dominated the competition. However, he won a great bronze in the marathon, behind Australian Internationals Mitchell Ross and Jaiden Lanigan, scorching away from Timaru star Jan Kuepper and the rest of the field at the finish. Lanigan took the overall title.</p>
<p>Valley In Lines' Anthony Nalder took the senior mens title by a point from Christchurch's star Ollie Jones. Timaru's Leah McDonald won the junior women's grade from USA skater Nina Tinsley and Timaru battler Ariana Snook. Keaton Swindells of Timaru took the cadet boys title.</p>
