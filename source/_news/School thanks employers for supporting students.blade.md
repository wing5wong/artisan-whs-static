<p><span>Whanganui High School principal Martin McAllen, with Sarah Gorringe and Tonyka Te Rangi from Smart Start Care and Education Centre, and Diane Howard, WHS's vocational studies director.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There's a group of Whanganui employers that has a special relationship with Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And recently the school held a special function to thank those Whanganui employers, all of whom have provided work experience for the school's senior students.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The employers were invited to the school on Thursday evening for a drink. All were presented with a plaque from the school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Peter Reid, Whanganui High School's employment co-ordinator, said the employers support the school by taking students in for work experience - which sometimes leads to apprenticeships or paid employment.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Reid said the school has two programmes that provide Year 12 and 13 students with work experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Gateway programme gives students the opportunity to work alongside an employer for two days a week, with the other three days spent at school. Students can also do study programmes for Gateway, with some students opting to take courses at organisations like Ag Challenge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This programme is long-term, and the students attend for the full school year," Mr Reid said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said sometimes a student will impress an employer so much that they will offer them an apprenticeship or job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have 10 students already this year who have left school to take up apprenticeships after doing the Gateway programme."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The more academically inclined students can do the vocational skills taster programme, which gives them one day a week with an employer for around six weeks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Those can be anything from a vet clinic to a beekeeper to a lawyer," Mr Reid said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This programme gives the student a chance to see if they would like working in a job they're interested in."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Reid said the school was very grateful to the employers who agree to take students.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They are so supportive and so willing to take these kids. Many of them also see the value of these students - we have an ageing workforce in Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said Whanganui High School had one of the biggest Gateway programmes in the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have funding for 84 students - six years ago, we had funding for 40."</p>
