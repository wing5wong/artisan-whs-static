<p class="element element-paragraph">From the dance floor to the canvas.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ardon England will be hoping his dancing skills can transfer to the boxing ring when he takes part in a charity boxing match in Auckland this October.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ardon was MC at the same MJT Events fight night last year before he was asked to come back as a fighter in one of this year's headline fights.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui man moved to Auckland last year to pursue a career in dance and hopes his first foray into boxing will come naturally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In terms of my dance I've got that rhythm," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"And it will help in learning punches because they're all numbered. The footwork's a little bit different but it's all got that rhythm and it's all technique so I'm learning fast which is good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Proceeds from ticket sales and an auction at the October 7 event will got to the Mental Health Foundation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's something I've always been real passionate about."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">England will be taking on Daniel Takawe in three two-minute rounds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't think I'm scared.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I know I will be closer to the time. I think the pressure of it is scary and someone's got to lose, so I hope it's not me, and I'm doing everything I can to make sure it's not."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He's been training four times a week in preparation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think it's fun. I actually really, really enjoy it."</p>
