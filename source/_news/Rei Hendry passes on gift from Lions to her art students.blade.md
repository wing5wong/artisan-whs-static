<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The Wanganui Lions Club recently donated $1,000 to Rei Hendry. There were &ldquo;no strings attached&rdquo; and it was a recognition for all the help and art work supplied by Rei and her students at her Art House to Kowhai Park. Tom Johnson from the club told River City Press that &ldquo;Rei worked for it. Without her help it would have cost the club a lot of money. The grant is no more than what she deserves.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Rei was &ldquo;very grateful for the generous donation&rdquo; and wondered &ldquo;how to use it to the greatest advantage.&rdquo; Her solution was to pass it on, plus an extra $200 donated by her husband Ross, to some of her senior students. These students had willingly helped out repainting a mural at the Park, decorating the train, doing face painting for organisations such as Plunket and the Cancer Society and also having worked in the shop at the Park.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Hayley McConachy and <strong>Stephanie Lockwood</strong> were given $300 each, while <strong>Daisy Wilkie, Dylan Wilkie</strong> and <strong>Cameron Boyd</strong> received $200 each. Four of the students will be at University while one of them will finish school at the end of this year.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Classes at the Art House recommence in the second week of February.</span></span></p>
