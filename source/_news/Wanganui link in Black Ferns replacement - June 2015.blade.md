<p><strong>A former Wanganui High School girl will join the Black Ferns for next week's tour of Canada.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sosoli Talawadua, nee Tofa</strong>, comes into the team as a front rower for the Women's Rugby Super Series, where New Zealand will meet hosts Canada, then England and the United States for games in Calgary, Red Deer (central Alberta) and Edmonton.</p>
<p>Talawadua comes from a sporting Wanganui family, as the Tofas run RiverCity Boxing Club. Her brother Viki Tofa also represented Steelform Wanganui at prop last year. She debuted for Waikato against Counties Manukau in the 2013 Women's NPC, and made 15 appearances in the NPC during the next two seasons.</p>
<p>She comes in for another player with Wanganui connections - former Girls' College student and current Manawatu Cyclone Sita Kuruyabaki, who has had delays with her visa.</p>
<p>The team have had several last-minute changes, starting with a new coach in Blues assistant Glenn Moore.</p>
<p>He replaces Greg Smith, who voluntarily stood down this week after being banned from coaching for 14 weeks by the Waikato union for alleged verbal abuse of a match official.</p>
<p>Moore said the super series would be all about building towards the 2017 World Cup.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity for the newcomers in the squad to gain invaluable international experience and stake their claim for the black jersey."</p>
<p>The Black Ferns play Canada at Calgary Rugby Park on Monday evening, local time.</p>
