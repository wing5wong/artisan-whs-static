This week we welcomed 20 students from our sister-school, Xuzhou Number 13 Middle School in China. While here, students will participate in ESOL lessons, [](<>)classes with buddies and various after school lessons including Art, Cooking and Technology. Today the group, along with 18 students co-hosted by Whanganui Girls' College, visited the Whanganui District Council Chambers. A big thank you to councillors Rob Vinsen and Josh Chandulal Mackay for hosting the group today.
