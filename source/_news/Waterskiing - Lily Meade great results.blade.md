<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Former Whanganui High School student Lily Meade WON the individual Under 21 women's division on her home water.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Only a superb final leap from a young Aussie going well beyond his previous limit prevent the New Zealand Under 21 group from getting a team victory at the top end of the Oz Kiwi Water Ski Challenge at Lake Wiritoa over the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Australian's won both the Under 21 and Under 17 divisions, while the New Zealanders claimed the Under 14 team honours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Under 21's, the final result came down to the jumps discipline and the Australians claimed it on a countback of 5m, which was all down to the last leap of Matthew Brown.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brown made a monster 56.8m off the ramp, eclipsing his previous best of around 50m, to allow his team to overtake the Kiwis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a familiar story told throughout the four days of competition, which began last Thursday, with several national records being broken.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Every skier that came here got a personal best," said Wanganui Water Ski Club's Simon Meade.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had a great towboat, the site was fantastic and the weather was perfect.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They've had an outstanding time."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Conditions stayed so hot at the lake for Saturday and yesterday that Meade joked even the North Queenslanders in the Australian team were beginning to feel the heat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui's Lily Meade won the individual Under 21 women's division on her home water</strong>,<strong> </strong>with Australians Shania Brown and Chelsea Brien getting the minor placings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Meade won the jump and tricks divisions, with her large tricks score being a personal best, which was enough to carry coming third in slalom.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under 21 men's grade was claimed by Australian Patrick Crisp, with countryman Harrison Harber second and Ashburton's Hugh Donaldson third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was an all-Australian top 3 in the Under 17 girls grade as Sade Ferguson was the winner from her sister Molly, with Layne Moroney in third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Under 17 boys, Timaru's Will Gibson was the winner, with Australians Luke McNee and Ryan Sciacca getting the minor placings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under 14 girls grade was won by Christchurch's Emily Milner, with Timaru's Alex Brown second after setting a national jumps record, while Australian Mila Bennett was third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Under 14 boys was won by Australian Joel O'Toole, with Whangarei's Mitchell Williams second and Aussie Lucas Cornale third.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The skiers held their prizegiving in town last night, and the Australians fly home this morning.</p>
