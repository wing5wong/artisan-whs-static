<p class="element element-paragraph">Motorists who park illegally around Whanganui's schools could find themselves out of pocket with the introduction of a new parking programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui District Council has recently introduced the programme it calls Project Kura.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Warrick Zander, from the council, said Project Kura would involve parking officers working with schools and parents to make sure cars are parked lawfully.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We'll do this by providing education about where to park to enable safe vehicle and active transport for students and anyone else around the school area," Mr Zander said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The project has already launched, but won't kick off properly until late July, after the winter school holidays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Parking wardens are not ticketing people illegally parked around schools at this stage - they are talking to drivers about where to safely and lawfully park," Mr Zander said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If there are cars repeatedly parked in unlawful spaces, we may look at ticketing people."</p>
