<p data-bind="text: $data">Darol Pointon started volunteering in 1959.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I had a boss who was in Rotary and in Braille Week, as they called it, they used to canvas every house in Wanganui. He said to me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not available that day. Here&rsquo;s your city area; go to it.&rsquo; It continued with Corso, Red Cross and never really stopped,&rdquo; says Darol.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Through his wife, Lorraine, Darol got involved with IHC, initially working the spinning jenny at a gala day. The late Tom Armstrong urged Darol to attend a committee meeting, on which there was a vacancy.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Tom didn&rsquo;t tell me it was the executive committee, and after a few months he said, &lsquo;I want to elevate you&rsquo;. The elevation was leadership of the Staff and Finance Committee.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I did that for about 15 years.&rdquo; While Darol was running the engineers&rsquo; office for the Hospital Board, he was approached by Harold Wynn, the chief executive.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chap coming down from Auckland in a Heart Foundation bus. Talk to him. Whatever it takes, you can do it in my time,&rdquo; he said to Darol. They wanted someone to set up the regional committee of the Heart Foundation. Darol became secretary-treasurer.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I set everything up and stayed there for about 15 years.&rdquo; Derek Nimmo, Alison Holst and Sir Brian Barratt-Boyes were all brought to Wanganui during that time. Sir Brian donated his Rolex watch to be raffled off.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Darol has also been involved with Freemasons&rsquo; charities, including a programme called Live Life Lighter, encompassing five health organisations.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I set it up and ran it for a week. We didn&rsquo;t make a lot of money but we made a lot of friends for Freemasonry.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Darol worked on quite a few Relays for Life for the Cancer Society.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">His &ldquo;partner in crime&rdquo; has always been his wife, Lorraine.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s my soul mate, and if we&rsquo;re going to do something, we do it together. She supports me and I support her.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We sat in Trafalgar Square three years in a row selling Christmas hams and raffle tickets for Kidney Kids and Children with Cancer at Starship.&rdquo; He has been a member of Wanganui Harriers for 63 years, 48 years with Freemasons, and he joined Oddfellows in 1959.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to belong to something you hang in there: Everything is for the long term.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Sandra Rickey, manager of Volunteer Whanganui, presented Darol with a certificate, a volunteer pin and a $40 voucher from Mud Ducks cafe.</p>
