<p>Over two years away from the boxing ring has not blunted the skills of popular Whanganui rugby star (and former WHS student) Viki Tofa as he hooked and jabbed his way to a majority decision win over Upper Hutt's Cory Enoka on Saturday evening.<br />PHOTO'S: &nbsp;Bevan Conley&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three round bout was the main event of the 2nd annual Wanganui Boxing Tournament, with the River City club pulling a big and rowdy crowd to their gym at the Kaierau Country Club, despite there being many other sports both locally and on television which could claim eyeballs that night.</p>
<p>Facing the much taller 32-year-old Enoka, the 24-year-old Tofa's timing and head movement was on point as he got the crowd roaring with every left hook he landed on the mark.</p>
<p>Enoka initially kept his left arm near his side and snapped it up with the jab to try and establish his distance, but Tofa connected with an overhand right and worked the body to get the better of Round 1.</p>
<p>Enoka's jabs were much better in the second round, while he moved back and away to avoid another Tofa hook, with both men starting to tie up in the centre of the ring.</p>
<p>However, Tofa was still landing the cleaner blows, and it was only a question of his ring conditioning holding up as they entered the third round.</p>
<p>Enoka was willing to push the pace as both men traded heavy leather to begin the final round, as Enoka finally looked to land a couple of body shots of his own, as Tofa was backed away for trying a good old wrestling headlock with short rabbit punches.</p>
<p>Both men were beginning to tire, but Tofa found another gear with two rapid jabs and a body shot, before a nervous moment as the referee inspected his bloodied eyebrow following a head clash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tofa muscled his opponent into the corner and looked to slug away, with Enoka responding in kind as the final bell rang.</p>
<p>Having earned the decision from the judges, a grinning Tofa said he had a little ring rust to begin with, but he was soon feeling the thrill of battle.</p>
<p>"It was bloody awesome, I haven't fought for two years.</p>
<p>"Adrenaline good, just good to be back in there. Thank the Lord every day."</p>
<p>While he is looking ahead to the 2017 rugby season and hopefully another Steelform Wanganui jersey, Tofa said he had loved boxing training with his father Eddie again and seeing how the support had grown for the club since they moved into the new premises in May last year.</p>
<p>"It's just bigger and better now.</p>
<p>"The fans, [were loud] right from the start to the end."</p>

<p>A few late changes in the card ultimately saw 16 bouts held, with the River City Boxing Club members having good success.</p>
<p>It was a big night for Egelani Taito, 25, who defeated Lawrence Prased in the third bout of the evening and then returned in the semi main event to defeat Tauramanui's Peraniko Crown.</p>
<p>Jesse Malcolm, 16, won his 60-64kg matchup with Palmerston North's Jayden Holden, while older brother Judah Malcolm, 17, was beaten by New Plymouth's Ben Dey.</p>
<p>River City's David Perofeta, 15, won his 70kg matchup with Dey's clubmate Daniel Heberley.</p>
<p>However, Eddie Tofa said there was much more to it than just the results in an amateur fight night.</p>
<p>"A win is a bonus, it's about good sportsmanship in the ring, and that people are welcome.</p>
<p>"It's so good to have that [crowd] support - the locals. Makes it worthwhile."</p>
