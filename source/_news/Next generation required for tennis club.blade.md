<p><strong>STEPPING UP: Whanganui tennis needs more youngsters like WHS student Sam Russell to fill the shoes of talented players who have moved on.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is next step: the future, for the Wanganui Tennis Club as the 2017-18 season begins with an open day this morning, ahead of the annual St John's Club junior tournament next Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Today's family open day begins at 11am, and will include a 12.30pm exhibition match, while there will be competitions before and after the game for guests and members.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is BYO for lunch, but the day will conclude with a light meal in the club lounge including ham on the bone, rolls and salads.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In changes made at the Basset St courts, nationally top 5-ranked women's player Leela Beattie will take over as the head and, currently, the only coach - although the 23-year-old is hopeful others will come on board to give assistance as the summer progresses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Trish Biddle-Amoroa will take over as the new chairwoman of the junior committee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Among Beattie's roles will be organising a holiday coaching programme from October 9-13, as the club looks to scout and recruit more young players over the summer months.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just obviously want to build it up and get them playing good tennis," said Beattie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just to want to get the kids to improve to play more tournaments.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At the moment, we don't have many; they're not up to that standard."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After five glorious summers in both junior and senior representative tennis, Beattie agreed Whanganui is now having to address the end of an era as the "once in a generation" extended family of the talented Butters clan have aged-out of the local scene.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cousins Paige Hourigan and <strong>Kyle Butters</strong> (former WHS student) followed their parents, aunts and uncles into the sport and became world-ranked juniors, now doing well in the United States college system.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Rebekah Butters-Chamberlain and Paris Butters</strong>&nbsp;(former WHS student) - with Paris having carried the torch for the last two seasons - are also starting out on their journey's away from home.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The teenagers presence helped Wanganui to junior representative success, multiple Christie Cup defences and ensured several Wanganui Open titles remained at home instead of departing to New Plymouth, Palmerston North or Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's really noticeable with <strong>Paris</strong> leaving," said Beattie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's not just Whanganui - the whole of New Zealand is a little bit behind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Building from the ground up, juniors are hard to come by."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Beattie wants to work with the young players coming through to improve their games so they can feel confident playing visitors or outside of the district - developing strong serves and keeping their heads through multiple matches in a weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is youngsters that fill the gaps in the Whanganui Christie Cup team, as after narrowly losing the crown to Manawatu in March when in sight of a record fifth consecutive summer as holders, they hope to win it back this December when the aforementioned family members are home for the holidays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I definitely think Whanganui always brings some good players, so we could definitely win again," said Beattie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as the juniors, Beattie will also be running a Tennis Fit programme and adult coaching lessons.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tennis is free at the courts in October.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next weekend will be the junior tournament with the St John's club coming on board as naming sponsor, replacing Slazenger.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tournament starts on Saturday and concludes on Tuesday with multiple age grades for singles and doubles.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Club member Neville Hopkins said entries and seedings will be confirmed next week, with registration on the Wanganui Tennis Club website.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's [also] an open event for adults or anyone to enter," said Hopkins.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We know some of the coaches are entering so they'll be some good very talent for that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The open tournaments for singles and doubles will be played on the Saturday and Sunday.</p>
