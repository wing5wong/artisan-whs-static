Four current and expat Whanganui Players have been on quite the adventure in the past week as the NZ Ambassadors XV defeated the Czech Republic national team 43-0 in Prague this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travelling over to Europe for the game was Border&rsquo;s utility back Craig Clare and Ngamatapouri&rsquo;s loose forward Bryn Hudson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from their home in England at Scarborough RUFC were cousins Sam Dawson at prop and <strong>Cade Robinson</strong> in the loose forwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ambassadors XV is a team of Kiwis who predominantly play rugby in the United Kingdom and Europe, and have one annual game against various international rugby teams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Former All Black Marty Berry and US Eagles squad member Aaron Satchwell were the coaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as the game, the squad spent time in Prague running coaching clinics for local children.</p>
