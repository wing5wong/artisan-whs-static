Whanganui High School has welcomed the largest intake of first-year students in its 63-year history.

Millie-Rose Broughton and Quin Harris-Campbell are two of the 367 students beginning their Year 9 education at the school this week.

Quin has come from Huntley School in Marton which had a roll of about 140 students last year.

"Even though WHS is a big school, it is quite easy to find your way around," Quin said.

"There are lots of areas I haven't visited yet but finding my way between classes has been okay."

Quin has a long-term ambition to study engineering although he's also a keen sportsman and would like to join the Central Stags cricket team someday.

Millie-Rose completed her primary education at Faith City School in Whanganui which has a roll of about 150 students.

"I'm interested in becoming a first responder and I'm also quite interested in veterinary science," she said.

"I'm enjoying the new experience of moving between classrooms and having different teachers."

Both students said coming to a school with a roll of almost 1500 doesn't phase them.

"Even though there are lots of people here it doesn't feel crowded," Quin said.

There are 29 students in each of their form classes and they believe that is a good number.

Principal Martin McAllen said class sizes were something he liked to reassure prospective students and parents about before they come to the school.

"Some think that because we're a big school, we have big classes which is not the case," he said.

"Year 9 students have come from over 20 schools in this region and I visited as many as I could last year.

"After the Covid disruptions in 2020, we tried something different and invited new students and their parents to visit during class times and it worked so well, we're considering doing it again this year."

McAllen said most students coped well during the Covid-19 level 4 lockdown last year although there was a fair amount of anxiety for some students and families as well as staff.

"The early days of the lockdown were not so bad but as time went on and uncertainty grew, it was an anxious time. There was a range of responses and we had to make sure to maintain good communication with our students and families.

"Being such a big workplace, there was a lot of logistical planning involved when we reopened - we had to order a lot of hand sanitiser as there 78 classrooms as well as common areas."

McAllen said he hopes there won't need to be another lockdown but the school would cope well if there was.

WHS has an extensive rebuilding programme scheduled for 2021.

The digital technology department will be remodelled and there will be new decking outside the canteen as well as more covered areas around the school.

"There will also be 44 new outdoor tables made of permanent materials that won't deteriorate like a lot of the wooden ones have," McAllen said.

WHS will hold a Year 9 Parents Information Evening on February 17.
