<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui brass players did their city proud at the recent Combined Central and Wellington District Associations Brass Band Contest in Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The senior Brass Whanganui band and the concert brass band made up of young and beginner adult players travelled to Wellington for the contest and musical director Bruce Jellyman said he was proud of how well everyone played.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Concert Brass came first in the youth/junior entertainment section.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They played so well and we are very proud of them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jonathan Greenwell directed and he was very good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The senior band also excelled, coming second in the Hymn contest, third in the Own Choice, second in the Entertainment and second in the Aggregate results.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When competing in regional and national contests, Whanganui Brass always run into former members now playing with their competitors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Quite a few of our members go to Victoria or the University of Wellington as it is now called so we often meet them at contests," says Jellyman.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are three former Brass Whanganui players in Porirua, Upper Hutt and Wellington bands and Tamara Stratton now plays tenor horn with the Wellington Brass Band.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The competition is always friendly and fun, says the Whanganui director.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We finished the weekend second to New Zealand champions Wellington which makes us the top B grade band.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a great result and exactly what we hoped for."</p>
