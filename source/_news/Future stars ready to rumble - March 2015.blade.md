<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">YOUNG GUNS: Brayden Maua v Earl-Jay Pehi will be one of the anticipated match-ups on the undercard of the River City Rumble tonight.</span></p>
<p>It is the next generation of Wanganui fighters who will have their moment to shine at the annual River City Rumble tonight at the War Memorial Hall.</p>
<p>Though this year's event does not have a major headliner like national title holders Kyle Gallacher, Leon Calver or Pete Parsons, the 12-fight show should have some action-packed bouts with pre-sale tickets doing very well.</p>
<p>The main event is a rematch between rivals Ata Fakalelu of MTI Wellington and RTF Wanganui's Aiden Koroheke at 105kg.</p>
<p>"I saw them fight in Wellington at the end of last year, it was a very close fight," said promoter Steve Alderton.</p>
<p>"As long as Aiden's been putting in the time [training], he should be in with a crack."</p>
<p>They will fight three two-minute rounds under modified muay thai rules, as will one of the featured undercard bouts between teenagers Brayden Maua (Wanganui Warriors) and Earl-Jay Pehi (RTF Wanganui).</p>
<p>Alderton said matching either young man for fights is difficult as they are physically too imposing for others in their age group, while their clubs are reluctant to put them against adults at this stage.</p>
<p>"They're 16-year-olds but they're the size of grown men.</p>
<p>"Brayden's got huge potential if he carries on training and Earl-Jay is good too. It's a test for both of them."</p>
<p>At 85kg, Maua will give up a slight weight advantage to Pehi (88kg), and will be leaving Wanganui soon for more training in Thailand.</p>
<p>Six of the fights will be novice bouts which don't recognise a winner, while the top end of the card will be five modified muay thai fights and one full muay thai fight, which allows for elbow strikes.</p>
<p>Eleven local fighters will be on the card.</p>
<p>Alderton is hoping the crowd, who are often rowdy inside the hall, will help carry the locals to good performances.</p>
<p>"The Wanganui crowd really get in behind it. The crowd makes a great evening too - the size and the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Come along and bring a good attitude.</p>
<p>In 10 Rumble events, with up to 500-700 people at each, security had only ever ejected one person, he said.</p>
<p>The doors open at 6pm, with the first bouts at 6.30pm.</p>
