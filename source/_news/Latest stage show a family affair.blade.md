<p>FAMILY AFFAIR:&nbsp;The Atkinson family, as cast in Repertory's production of <strong><em>The Pohutukawa Tree</em> </strong>- Carey Knapp (Clive Atkinson), former WHS student Shaila Hawkins (Sylvia Atkinson) and Karen Hughes (Isobel Atkinson).<br />PHOTO:&nbsp;<span>Repertory Theatre</span></p>
<p>Written by Nadine Rayner from the Repertory Theatre.</p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Clive Atkinson are pleased to announce the forthcoming marriage of their only daughter Sylvia to Mr George Rawlings DFC and Bar, the service to be conducted by the Reverend Athol Sedgwick at the Te Parenga Anglican church followed by a reception at their nearby homestead.</p>
<p>Three well-known theatre personalities comprise the Atkinson family in the Whanganui Repertory Theatre's production of Bruce Mason's <em>The Pohutukawa Tree</em>.</p>
<p>Carey Knapp plays Clive Atkinson, Karen Hughes is Mrs Atkinson and&nbsp;Shaila&nbsp;Anne&nbsp;Hawkins&nbsp;plays the part of their daughter Sylvia.</p>
<p>Karen Hughes told me that she enjoyed seeing a play develop, becoming familiar with the character she's playing, understanding their motivations and their relationships with the other characters in the play.</p>
<p>"You have to work out what the playwright was thinking. What did they mean ... why is that line there? Every line, no matter how small, is important."</p>
<p>When I asked her what she enjoyed most about playing Mrs Atkinson a huge smile spread across her face.</p>
<p>"The costumes! I love vintage costumes and dressing up."</p>
<p><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> in 2013 was Karen's first play at Repertory Theatre.</p>
<p>"Oscar Wilde as a first play was a huge challenge," she says.</p>
<p>Since then Karen has appeared in <em>Funny Money</em> (2014) and <em>The Doll's House</em> (2015).</p>
<p>"I like it here," Karen says of Repertory Theatre. "It looks like a theatre, feels like a theatre ... it's got a real theatre atmosphere.</p>
<p>"I really enjoyed drama classes at school but after I left school life got in the way and I didn't do anything in theatre for ages. It was always something I had a hankering to do though."</p>
<p>When I asked Carey Knapp what had been the catalyst for his involvement with theatre, he didn't hesitate.</p>
<p>"Dee Gray," he said. "I was doing voice coaching with Dee and she encouraged me to become involved in theatre. She thought it would be good for me and I just fell in love with it. I decided that's where my artistic outlet should be."</p>
<p>Carey's played a lot of characters in the 10 years he's been involved with Repertory.</p>
<p>"I've been in about 20 shows. I like playing the part of a likeable rogue, villains generally - my favourite role was Detective Sergeant Davenport in <em>Funny Money</em>. But I don't like playing the part of a really bad guy - nobody likes him."</p>
<p>He thinks <em>The Pohutukawa Tree's</em> Clive Atkinson is basically a nice guy but although he depends on the Mataira family he takes them for granted - "He's quite ignorant really."</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Atkinson, their daughter, the bride in this play, is portrayed by&nbsp;Shaila&nbsp;Anne&nbsp;Hawkins&nbsp;who I remember on stage as a very little girl. Now 18, this recent school leaver has been involved in theatre for most of her young life. She's just finished a playing a part in a one-act play and last year she played the part of Dorothy in <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Her favourite role?</strong></p>
<p><strong>"<em>Annie</em>. I was Annie in the High School production and that was my favourite."</strong></p>
<p>What does she like most about playing Sylvia Atkinson?</p>
<p>"I get to wear a beautiful dress," she said ... and this "girly girl" does make a beautiful bride.</p>
<p>Karen, Carey and&nbsp;Shaila&nbsp;Anne have known each other for some time and been in several plays together so they are very comfortable with each other. Well, they are a family, aren't they?</p>
