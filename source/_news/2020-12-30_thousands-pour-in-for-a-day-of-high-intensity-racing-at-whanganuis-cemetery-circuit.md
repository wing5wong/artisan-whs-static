In what has become a staple of summer in Whanganui, thousands packed the streets around the Heads Road cemetery on Saturday as the annual Cemetery Circuit motorcycle event kicked off.

The circuit, the final round in the 2020 Suzuki International Series, sees over a hundred bikes from across New Zealand congregate in the city, all with the hope of taking out their respective category.

This year, with the borders closed and international travel a no-go, all contestants bar one Australian were from New Zealand, with entrants hailing from Northland all the way to Southland.

It wasn't only competitors travelling for the event either, with thousands of out of towners and Whanganui locals alike packing in to watch the action, armed with leftovers from Christmas.

Travelling from Tokomaru, spectators Peter and Denise Nelson said the event was well worth it.
"I haven't been for many years, since I was a kid probably. It's great fun," Peter said.

"It's awesome to see such a great turnout too, there's people everywhere."

Also keeping an eye on the bikes was James Kotua, who hadn't been to the event in some years.

"It's awesome this year. The supermotos are different. It's such a show of talent and speed. Helps when it's a great day too," Kotua said.

"I haven't come for a few years now, but it's bloody great. Well worth it."

As they do every year, the Harlow family had made the trek from Wellington, and said they'd been looking forward to the day for weeks.

"We don't know anything about motorcycling, but it's always a great day in the sun with the kids, so we enjoy it," dad Isaac said.

According to Police the event was successful, with a spokesperson confirming there were no significant issues reported during the day.

First beginning in 1951, the event has solidified itself as the premier motorcycle racing event in the country.

According to organisers, the Whanganui circuit is "counted as the premier street race venue in the Southern Hemisphere."
