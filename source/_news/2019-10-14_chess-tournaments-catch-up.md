The end of last term was a big one for the Chess Club, starting out with a regional tournament for individual players on Thursday 26 September. This was a great day out against some of the best chess players Whanganui has to offer, leading to a lot of challenging games. In the end we had one placing, with **Victor Xie taking 3rd place in the Under 16 bracket.**  Our other individual players where Luke Pearson, Shae Kairau, Dekin Chadfield and Sam Gray.

The day ended with everyone playing games against a tag-team of a chess grandmaster and an Oceanic champion. While it is safe to say that no one won, this was a lot of fun and a highlight to the day.

Only two days later, our A Team - Luke Pearson, Shae Kairau, Dekin Chadfield and Victor Xie - headed down to Palmerston North for the national competition. We put a good fight and won several games individually, but ultimately couldnâ€™t hold our own at a national level. That being said, the team is more motivated than ever to get study and practice in and come again next year.
