<p>The Te Ringa Miti Tai Heke Whanganui group have done themselves proud after a successful campaign at the 2016 Waka Ama Sprint Nationals at Lake Karapiro recently.</p>
<p>Six crews from the club competed at the January 18-23 event, while club captain Anne Kauika had the best success across her multiple teams.</p>
<p>She won three gold medals - Master Women W12 crew in the 500m final, the Senior Master Women W6 golds for both the 500m and 1000m.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Lauren Tamehana said Kauika and her team-mates qualified for the Va'a World Club Championships, being held at Lake Kawana on Australia's Sunshine Coast in May.</p>
<p>"Our J19 (Junior Under 19) men's team 'Kotahi Aroha' also qualified to compete at the worlds for the J19 Men 1000m race," said Tamehana.</p>
<p>"They made finals for both their 500m and 1000m races."</p>
<p>Crew member Daniel Kauika was also named in the New Zealand J19 Men's Elite team, one of seven paddlers chosen from the nationals, and will race in the Elite section at Lake Kawana.</p>
<p>As an individual, Kauika also entered the 250m dash for his age grade and won the bronze medal.</p>
<p>"There are only four teams from New Zealand competing in the Elite competition - J19 Women, J19 Men, Premier Women and Premier Men," said Tamehana.</p>
<p>Kauika will therefore pull double duty in Australia - racing in the Elite events and then also for his club crew.</p>
<p>He had been part of the extended Elite squad for the past six months, travelling around the North Island to attend monthly camps, alongside his own team training at home.</p>
<p>Elsewhere for Te Ringa Miti Tai Heke Whanganui, the premier women's team Awatere - a new crew made up of experienced and inexperienced paddlers - overcame the problem of their steerer getting injured and being replaced to make the finals of the 500m race.</p>
<p>The W12 Team Hearty Sistaz, a mixture of J16 and J19 women, also made the J19 finals.</p>
<p>Other teams to represent the club at Lake Karapiro were Kaha Maia (J16 women), Team Hearty (J19 women), Sistaz b4 Mistaz (J19 women), and Matahi (Senior Master Men).</p>
<p>"Last year training was delayed for many of our paddlers as we were still recovering from the storm event in June," said Tamehana.</p>
<p>"Our club will now be focused on fundraising to help our members and their support crew get to Lake Kawana for worlds in three months' time."</p>
<p>The club will be holding a 6-8 week twilight event, starting February 11.</p>
