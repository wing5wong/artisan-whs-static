<p>Whanganui High School student Charlotte Taylor is a busy young lady.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as the usual academic pressures that come with being a Year 13 student, <strong>Charlotte is preparing for two national cooking competitions in the next six weeks, in Auckland.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>With cooking partner Olivia Caird, she'll be competing in August in the National Secondary Schools' Culinary Challenge. Later this month she'll be teaming up with Matt Hirini for the NZ Chefs' Beef and Lamb College Challenge.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This second competition is a "mystery box" competition - meaning Matt and Charlotte don't know what they'll be cooking until an hour before the competition starts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We know we have to cook a meat, a starch, a minimum of two vegetables and a sauce of some sort," Charlotte said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So how do you practise for a competition when you don't know what you're cooking?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You just have to practise your basic cooking techniques," Matt said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The students are putting in long hours in the kitchen under the guidance of mentor Dean Wong and teacher Linda Hardcastle, who will both be travelling to Auckland with the pair.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a big undertaking, because we have to take everything we need for the competition with us - literally everything, including the kitchen sink," Ms Hardcastle said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Matt and Charlotte are looking for sponsorship to help them get to Auckland. If you would like to help with sponsorship, please contact Linda Hardcastle through Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
