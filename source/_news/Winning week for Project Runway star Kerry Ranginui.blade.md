<p class="element element-paragraph">Sitting in a judge's seat at the Wanganui Racecourse was a nice change of pace for Kerry Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>&nbsp;contestant joined rowing medallist Rebecca Scown and local fashionista Jenny Meade in judging the Protege Hairdressing Fashion in the Field entries for Christmas at the Races on December 1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great to be judging rather than being judged for a change," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had fun - the other two judges were great and we had no trouble agreeing on the winners."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a great week for the Karen Walker pattern maker - celebrity judge in his hometown and the judges' favourite on Monday night's episode of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was the challenge I had been most looking forward to and I was very pleased to win."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His impeccably tailored suit gave him the edge over the other contestants and it was Peni Moala from Arrowtown who was told to pack up his sewing kit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now there are just four of the original 14 contestants left and just two episodes left to run.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It does get a lot harder at this stage," says Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The standard of work is very high and you have to work a lot harder to impress the judges because they have so few designs to look at now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There is a lot more close scrutiny than there was in the early episodes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whatever the outcome of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>, Ranginui says he will be in Whanganui for Christmas spending time with family, friends and relaxing at the beach.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Project Runway NZ: Mondays 7.30pm on TVNZ 2.</strong></p>
