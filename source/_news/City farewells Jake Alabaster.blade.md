<p><strong><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&amp;objectid=11930520">City Farewells Jake Alabaster</a></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jake Mitchell Alabaster was brought onto the Cooks Gardens rugby field one final time in front of his biggest crowd yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">More than 1000 guests either stood or sat on chairs on the rain-soaked field, or watched from the grandstands, in an emotional funeral service for the 24-year-old Wanganui representative, who died in his sleep last Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WRFU prepared the field as if it was a rugby match, while the scoreboard printed up a farewell message and a large video screen was brought in to display pictures of Alabaster's life with friends and family.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alabaster's casket, covered in handwritten farewell messages with a chainsaw placed on top, was carried onto the field to the song Bad to the Bone by George Thorogood and the Destroyers - an Alabaster favourite.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following the service, the body was taken for a private family cremation and burial at Aramoho Cemetery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jake Alabaster would have been proud and delighted that so many of you have turned out to honour his 24 years of life," said Grant McKinnon, who officiated the ceremony.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"As a flanker, he would have looked out and said, 'sh*tty weather, let's get on with it'."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Born in Whanganui, Alabaster attended Mosston School then Whanganui Intermediate and Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Initially a soccer player, he switched to rugby and played for every Wanganui age-grade representative team from Under 11 to Under 20, making the Under 20 team while still 17 and before captaining the Under 18's, and then making the Wanganui Development XV.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He came through the ranks of the Marist club after leaving WHS early - playing for the Buffalos and Celtic before making the Marist Premier side.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Switching to the Border club, Alabaster's final game of rugby was on Cooks Gardens when the Waverley club won the 2016 Premier final.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">An outdoors man, Alabaster loved boating, wakeboarding, fishing, hunting and snowboarding.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mother Cheryll was joined by son Kane and daughter Roxanne on the stage and read several well-known verses and poems in tribute to her son, including You are my Sunshine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Love and respect, my sunshine, my baby boy. Fly high and visit me in my dreams."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kane Alabaster said his brother reached out to people wherever he went.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I love you and I'll miss you and I'll cherish the moments we spent together for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have lost a brother but gained an angel and for that I am thankful."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Representing the rugby community, former Border coach Ross Williams spoke of a determined player loved by his team mates - recalling the story of Alabaster playing his Wanganui senior debut last year against the Manawatu Evergreens with a busted shoulder.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young man stood his ground on one high kick and took the ball despite being smashed by a charging 120kg opponent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The thud of hitting the ground silenced everyone...and Jake loved it," said Williams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jake Alabaster was relentless and uncompromising on the rugby field.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Rugby is not just a game, it's a family, and we all stand in shock and sadness in the loss of our mate Jake."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former forestry employer John Reid recalled a phone call in 2011 recommending a young man "with a good handshake and spark in his eye", who would work for him part-time while playing for the Whanganui High School 1st XV.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leaving school and going on to earn three national certificates, Alabaster proved to be a reliable cable logging worker, in all weather up in the hills.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jake was our brother," said Reid.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whenever the rain washes away my tears, I will remember this man."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Best friends Dylan Pearce and Hamish Palmer, who also spoke on behalf of his sister and Alabaster's partner Georgia Palmer, remembered a mate who had been a tearaway in his youth, but at his heart was a gentle giant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As the life of the party, there had been the odd police callout for a prank gone wrong and fun bike rides after siphoning from bottles in the family liquor cabinet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You have given us a hell of a ride for 24 years, there was never a dull moment," said Hamish Palmer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alabaster later moved into the Palmer household and matured greatly, which pleased Hamish after he had begun dating Georgia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A brother to me, and a son to the old man."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pearce spoke of his delight when Alabaster came back from overseas and wanted to work in his family beekeeping business, getting ready to set up his future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"No mountain was ever too high for you, and if it was, I'm sure you would just run through the middle anyway."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It had been a privilege for Pearce to deliver Alabaster's body home from Auckland, alongside his other friends, in his ute truck.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After reading the committal, McKinnon invited guests to follow behind the procession carrying the casket up the hill to the function centre in the Cook Gardens grandstand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Instead, the large assembly formed up on both sides of the pall-bearers and family, creating what amounted to a guard of honour across the field.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Near the end of the line, young players from multiple clubs and schools along with other friends who knew Alabaster the best, stood together and delivered an emotional haka.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Done him proud, boys," his mother called out to them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Guests had travelled from Australia and as far away as the United Kingdom for the funeral.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Special commemorative jerseys stitched together from the Marist and Border uniforms have been created and it is understood there will be a memorial prize in Alabaster's name for Premier games between the two clubs, beginning next year.</p>
