Despite all the challenges that 2020 has thrown at us, we somehow managed to squeeze our annual South Island trip in. After six different proposals and schedules, we eventually settled on version seven. So, with a much smaller cohort and a shortened version of what we normally do, we set off on a five day and four night adventure. 

We departed Whanganui High School at our usual crazy time of 4 am and headed to Wellington. The weather forecast was frightening and rather than putting us at ease, the flight attendant warned of a very rough flight and the potential to have to return, as three planes had had to the day before. Thankfully, despite the forecast and warnings from the captain, the flight was tame and we touched down on time. After a brief supermarket shop, we arrived at a very quiet Kawarau Bungy Centre where six brave souls threw themselves off the 43m high bridge. A couple of zip lines were enjoyed before we ventured up the Crown Range. With inclement weather over the opposing hills, we patiently waited for the snow to fall but it never eventuated. We arrived in Wanaka under grey skies and students settled into their accommodation quarters before being treated to my famous wraps which consisted of hot chips, cooked chicken, ham, cheese and a cinnamon doughnut, eaten like an apple. The following day involved a fair amount of driving as we headed down the Clutha River inspecting the hydro-electric sites and then took a few back-road detours on our way to Te Anau. With the Milford Road being closed for the previous few days, our Milford Sound cruise was looking unlikely given the continued avalanche risk. But some fine work by the Milford Road crew enabled our safe passage so that we could enjoy a spectacular boat ride through the fiord. We were lucky enough to spot a Fiordland Crested Penguin, one of the rarest birds in the world. After leaving the deserted streets of Te Anau, we headed into Queenstown and admired the views from high up on The Remarkables Ski Field Road. Then we headed to the Gondola and Luge for a bit of fun before heading into town and learning about the history through the Time Tripper experience. A hearty Fergburger was followed by the Fear Factory. Our final day involved a nice scenic drive up to Glenorchy and the Dart Bridge. We returned and headed up to Arrowtown where some struck gold in their prospecting pans. A quick game of laser tag and bumpy flight home followed by the van journey back to Whanganui. The students were great and whilst the teacherâ€™s singing still needed improvement, at least  the van was driven safely and returned everyone home. 

Thanks to all for a great few days.
