<p><strong>From River City to runways in Melbourne</strong><br /><span>LEAPS AND BOUNDS: Former WHS student&nbsp;Jack Stratton-Smith moved to Melbourne to pursue an acting career, and has already met numerous A-list actors.</span></p>
<p>When former Whanganui man Jack Stratton-Smith isn't getting his clothes "ripped off by six people" backstage at Fashion Week, he's rubbing shoulders with A-listers and trying to "play it cool".</p>
<p>The 21-year-old, who was born and bred in the River City, moved to Melbourne in 2013 in pursuit of a career in acting, and has since "fallen into" modelling with agency Chadwick Models.</p>
<p>Breaking into the film industry is still the ex-Whanganui High School student's goal.</p>
<p>Mr Stratton-Smith was able to spend January to March working as a "picture double" for Night Manager and Thor actor Tom Hiddleston on the set of the latest King Kong movie, Kong: Skull Island.</p>
<p>"Tom and I are attached for six weeks. I basically go into the set and do the scene for the lighting guys."</p>
<p>The role involved him doing takes, sometimes alongside other stars of the film.</p>
<p>His first day on the job, he was almost immediately thrust into a practice take with the other actors, including Samuel L. Jackson, Roseanne and Monsters Inc's John Goodman, Room's Brie Larson, and Talladega Nights' John C. Rielly.</p>
<p>"I was actually *****ing myself," he said. "Every big name in the film was in the scene.</p>
<p>"You're hanging on set with them. You just have free range to basically everyone. Everyone was just so chill and so lovely."</p>
<p>Mr Stratton-Smith said there was an "element" of being starstruck when he first saw them, but said that it was important to "play it cool".</p>
