<p>Collegiate halfback and captain Josh Lennox is caught by the <strong>Whanganui High School tacklers in the big game at Cooks Gardens on Wednesday night.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A season of being boys playing young men meant the Whanganui High School First XV felt no intimidation as they defeated town rivals Wanganui Collegiate 13-8 in the main event of the school exchange at Cooks Gardens on Wednesday evening.</strong></p>
<p>Facing the haka from the Collegiate team and several hundred of their schoolmates, WHS were not overawed by the occasion, having had a great season by playing their way into this weekend's final of the Manawatu Colts competition.</p>
<p>The match settled into a pattern where Collegiate were strong in the set piece, especially the scrum, but WHS scrambled well in broken play, with their loose forwards turning over a lot of priceless possession.</p>
<p>Collegiate scored the opening try, which was followed by a WHS penalty, before Collegiate added a three-pointer of their own for an 8-3 scoreline.</p>
<p>The decisive moments came midway through the second half when, despite losing a player for 10 minutes for a punch, WHS scored two quick tries and never looked back.</p>
<p>Collegiate made a couple of late surges but, with WHS hunting the turnover at the breakdown, they were penalised both times to see the game slip away.</p>
<p>"They were deserving winners on the night," said WCS director of rugby Guy Lennox.</p>
<p>"It was a pretty stop-start affair, a lot of whistle.</p>
<p>"They scored two tries in five minutes with 14 men. I think they were fired up."</p>
<p>WHS manager Richard Bennett said the scoring burst came as a surprise.</p>
<p>"When [the sinbinning] happened we thought, 'We've got the ability to apply pressure'.</p>
<p>"The guys just carried on. They didn't even think about being a player down.</p>
<p>"We managed to hold them out, we were lucky we've got a couple of players in particular that are able to turn the ball over in rucks and mauls."</p>
<p>He praised Dilan Bowater and Tom Healy in that area.</p>
<p>Having battered each other on Wednesday night, both teams now have a rough turnaround for tomorrow as Collegiate will face the strong Taranaki school, Francis&nbsp;<br />Douglas Memorial College, and WHS meet the unbeaten Massey White on the No3 field of Arena Manawatu in the Manawatu Colts final.</p>
<p>Lennox acknowledged the schools had put the pressure on themselves - FDMC for example have had a two week rest - but as WCS and WHS play in busy weekend competitions, the only way to maintain their traditional cross-town rivalries was midweek.</p>
<p>"We've been doing a lot of that this year, there's no excuses."</p>
<p>Bennett agreed. "The highlight of the year was the Collegiate game, and the icing on the cake would be Massey.</p>
<p>"They'll be a little bit fresher, but after last night's game our boys can take a lot of confidence from that."</p>
<p>In the other WHS v WCS matches played on Wednesday, the Boys First XI football game was won by WHS 2-1, while the Girls First XI game finished in a 3-all draw.</p>
<p>The Senior A netball game has been deferred to next Wednesday.</p>
<p>As reported yesterday, WCS won the Second XV and Under-15 rugby games 79-0 and 72-0 respectively.</p>
