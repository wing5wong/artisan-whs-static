<p>Dear Parents, Caregivers and Friends of the School&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fourth term is a demanding term for all those in all schools.&nbsp; It is a term when we focus on final aspects of preparation, particularly senior students who are looking to take the next step in their own adult lives.&nbsp; For those in Year 13 this means exiting the school and therefore joining the bottom rung of new ladders in tertiary study or careers at work.&nbsp; For some students this may mean a combination of both.&nbsp; It is very important that our parents and families engage in serious conversations about these important next steps.&nbsp; Too often young people are left to negotiate this maze of decision-making on their own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools do an awful lot in this space and are active in offering opportunities, scholarships and apprenticeships.&nbsp; I often wonder how much our children and young people actually know about the work that parents and caregivers do in their own employment.&nbsp; This is often a good starting point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest references and testimonials to write, in order to access these opportunities beyond school, are for those who have been reliable, honest, co-operative and enthusiastic, combined with a healthy dose of activity beyond the classroom.&nbsp; Above all employees want to meet young people who have demonstrated the ability to communicate and show initiative and again these are work traits that are expected at school but should be re-enforced in the home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The recent Whanganui High School Sports Awards celebrated no less than 17 New Zealand Representatives and title holders and success in 26 sporting codes.&nbsp; In a similar way Cultural Awards will also acknowledge those who have the ability to take the stage and entertain, the success of Stage Challenge in many ways epitomises this.&nbsp;&nbsp; When all is said and done success for young people is the result of constant, positive interaction between themselves, family and school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Ross G Brown<br />Principal&nbsp;</p>
