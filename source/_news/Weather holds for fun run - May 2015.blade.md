<p>WHIPPET QUICK: &nbsp;5km run winner Rebecca Baker of Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>After all the nervous eyes glancing at the clouds yesterday, the annual Property Brokers Round the Bridges fun run and walk went off without a hitch for the 38th year in overcast but dry conditions.</p>
<p>Around 1000 people entered among the five walking and running grades, which was well down on the 1700 from the year before.</p>
<p>Most importantly, over $2500 was raised for this year&rsquo;s charity &mdash; family support group Jigsaw Whanganui.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wanganui High School&rsquo;s Rebecca Baker got one back for the team in green as the 13-year old held off the Collegiate runners in the 5km run.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw them coming but I just kept doing what I was doing. We always do it, me and my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damien Wood went one spot better than 2014 to win the 10km walk in 52 minutes, adding another prize to the growing number of masters and harriers walker events where he has reached the podium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always that thing, I can run it and finish in the back of the pack, or walk and do well,&rdquo; he said.</p>
