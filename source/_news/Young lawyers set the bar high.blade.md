<p><span>FINAL STEP: Admitted to the bar on Thursday were <strong>Petra Allan</strong> (former WHS student), left, <strong>Nicole Slight</strong> <span>(former WHS student)</span>, Caroline McHardy, <strong>Nick Robertson</strong><span>&nbsp;(former WHS student)</span>. and Sophie Nevill (front).</span></p>
<p>Five lawyers were admitted to the bar in Whanganui on Thursday, four with strong links to the region.</p>
<p>The ceremony at the High Court saw Nick Robertson, Petra Allen, Sophie Nevill, Nicole Slight and Caroline McHardy admitted before family, friends, colleagues and Justice Collins who officiated.</p>
<p>Nicole Slight went to Whanganui High School and studied law at Victoria University. She spent the last year of her degree, 2013, at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"I am interested in the international policy side of things and and my mother's family is Dutch."</p>
<p>Nicole is working in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in Wellington. She is interested in public international law.</p>
<p>She chose law because she "really enjoyed" history and English at secondary school and teachers suggested she try law.</p>
<p>The law degree also meant she could study a number of other subjects in her first year.</p>
<p>She is not sure when she will return to law: "I am very happy where I am. And policy is a lot about law."</p>
<p>Petra Allen says she feels privileged to be able to help people understand the law.</p>
<p>The Victoria University graduate is working at Treadwell Gordon in Whanganui. She gets considerable enjoyment from explaining to people what they are signing or going through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">"I am very lucky to have the skills to get a law degree. I really want to help people and give back."</span></p>
<p>She is the first in her family to study law.</p>
<p>Petra, who went to Whanganui High School, was proud to be admitted to the bar in Whanganui, her home town.</p>
<p>"We all felt really lucky. We had one on one time with the judge and were able to talk to him. He spoke to each of us by name. It meant a lot."</p>
<p>Her first aim in her first job is to be a "good all-round practice lawyer."</p>
<p>After that she may know where she should specialise.</p>
<p>Caroline McHardy of Gisborne said her mum is a probation officer and she heard "good stories from court" growing up so the law had its attractions.</p>
<p>She comes from a farming background and wants to work in the industry.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to be a shepherd or a farmer so law meant I could still be part of it."</p>
<p>Caroline did a dual law/accounting degree so her future lies with commercial law.</p>
<p>Employed by Cooper Rapley in Palmerston North she is a Victoria University graduate.</p>
<p>"It's cool all of us are working in the provinces, rather than big city practices."</p>
<p>Nick Robertson is following in his father's footsteps. Also a Victoria University graduate, he has joined Armstrong Barton.</p>
<p>"My dad practices in Whanganui so he was my inspiration."</p>
<p>Born and raised in Whanganui, Nick went to St Johns, St George's and Whanganui High schools.</p>
<p>He has not yet decided which area of the law is best for him.</p>
<p>Sophie Nevill also has a strong family background in the law - her mum Fenella Devlin was a lawyer in Whanganui for 14 years and two of her aunties are lawyers.</p>
<p>"That was a drawcard."</p>
<p>Sophie graduated from the University of Canterbury this year and is working at Bullock and Associates. Again the links are strong; her mother and one of her aunts worked at the firm when it wads Jack Riddet Tripe.</p>
<p>Sophie is from Marton and went to St George's and Nga Tawa schools. Career wise, she is "trying everything" at the moment.</p>
<p>"I'm doing property and family matters now."</p>
<p>All lawyers in New Zealand in order to practice after obtaining a law degree undergo further training to be admitted to the High Court. This procedure is called admission to the bar.</p>
