<p><strong>FILLING A GAP: Andrew Lock (left) and Dilan Raj of DnA Events believe Year 9 and 10 student numbers offer huge potential for their event.</strong></p>
<p><span>An exciting new event is scheduled for Whanganui next year ... The question is: What will it be?</span></p>
<p><span>The call went out earlier this year from Whanganui and Partners marketing manager Lyn Cheyne for ideas, and the creative juices flowed as various projects were put forward.</span></p>
<p><span>The field has been narrowed down to six finalists bidding for $15,000 worth of support and expertise and the chance to put their event on in 2017. Those six bright sparks will face the Den of Dragons, a judging panel with serious events and marketing experience, at the War Memorial Centre on Wednesday evening when Whanganui's next big thing will be chosen.</span><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>John Maslin</strong><span>&nbsp;took a look at the six finalists, so check them out and let us know what idea you think will put Whanganui on the map. Send your feedback by email to: editor@wanganuichronicle.co.nz; orwrite to The Editor, Wanganui Chronicle, 100 Guyton Street, PO Box 433, Wanganui 4500.</span></p>
<p><strong>Below is Andrew Lock and Dilan Raj project:</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Event to boost school sport</strong><br /><span>Witnessing a marked decline in sport activity among Year 9 and 10 secondary school students was the prompt Dilan Raj and Andrew Lock needed to get involved in the Den of Dragons. DnA Events is one of six finalists with an event based in part on the highly successful Masters Games principles.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"Basically our event will be a junior Masters Games based on participation, camaraderie, self-development and school pride," Mr Raj said.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Both he and Mr Lock have had long involvement in sports and at school level but have been saddened with the marked decline in participation. Their event philosophy is "participate, enjoy, develop".</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>There's no other event like it in the country and they said they already had interest from across the Whanganui and Manawatu region.&nbsp;</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Mr Raj said they reckon on more than 1500 participants at their first event.</span></span></p>
