Overnight our Under 19’s finished off the first leg of the World Coastal Championships with some great results in the B Finals. 

They should be super proud of their achievements especially given that for the endurance races, there is no age group category, so our Under 19’s raced in the Open Grade.  

1st – Women’s Double – Tegan Negus and Lilly Curnow

3rd – Mixed Double – Jameson McConnochie and Naomi Robertson 

4th – Men’s Double – Jake Newton and Charles Beale 

5th – Mixed Double – Will Herd and Ella Barr

8th – Men’s Single – Coby Goode

10th – Men’s Quad – Jameson McConnochie,  Jake Newton, Charles Beale, Coby Goode, Naomi Robertson (cox)

Both teams (Open and U19) will now shift their focus to the Beach Sprints which kick off on Friday evening NZT
