<p><span>FEED ME: Former WHS student, <strong>Shaila Hawkins</strong> as Audrey and Chris Pedley as Seymour with carnivorous plant Audrey II in Little Shop of Horrors.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Shaila </strong>Hawkins says she is pumped and ready for her role as Audrey in Amdram's production of&nbsp;<em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Directed by WHS teacher Colin Hedivan</strong> and supported by a music direction team of Lynn Whiteside, Errol Christiansen and Abigail Livesay, the show kicked off with a gala opening on Friday night (Last night for cyber version).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fans of the musical, which is based on a low-budget 1960 black comedy film -&nbsp;<em>The Little Shop of Horrors</em>&nbsp;- will know that Audrey II is a giant carnivorous plant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have had to make four versions of Audrey II," says Shaila.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has been quite a challenge and so much work has gone into them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We will have to keep them in our wardrobe collection but they will take up a lot of space."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The smaller versions of the plant were made by Yvonne Jones with help from her husband Ian on the third one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chicken wire and mattress rubber were the main components for the largest, most fearsome Audrey II made by Kirk Nicholls, Terry Lobb, Ian Jones and Geoff Campbell with advice from costumer Lee Williams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The music, composed by Alan Menken in the style of early 1960s rock and roll, doo-wop and early Motown, includes several well-known tunes, including the title song,&nbsp;<em>Skid Row (Downtown), Somewhere That's Green</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Suddenly, Seymour.</em><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Tickets $25/$20 from the Royal Wanganui Opera House; some door sales available. For more information see Amdram website or Facebook page.</strong><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Add an Antipasto Platter for two for $20 (a selection of cheese, olives, charcuterie, dips and breads).</p>
