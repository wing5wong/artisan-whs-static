<p><strong>CD REP: Joseph Redpath will be one of three Central District age group reps in the WHS 1st X1 for tonight's semi-final clash with WCS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Whanganui High School boys and girls 1st X1 hockey teams will put their hot season form on the line this evening when they front up in their respective semi-finals.</strong></p>
<p>The boys play in the Manawatu division 1 secondary school competition and will meet the Wanganui Collegiate 1st X1 in a home derby on <strong>Collegiate turf this evening.</strong></p>
<p>The WHS boys are unbeaten winning 11 straight games in the competition this season. Their season has also included a handful of wins against schools in the lower North Island, most recently beating the country's fifth ranked secondary school, Palmerston North Boys High School 1st XI 3-2.</p>
<p>Within the Palmerston North competition WHS' greatest rivals, Waiopehu college (ranked 10th in NZ) have provided the toughest encounters. Victories over them have been nail-biting, 3-2 and 3-1 respectively.</p>
<p>The team is looking to build towards the national tournament in two weeks' time and is looking to keep the ball rolling as the season nears its completion.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">With only a handful of games to go until the nationals the boys are aiming to cement their name as one of the teams to beat and prove that WHS School is renowned as the School of Champions. Their goal is completing the season unbeaten.</span></p>
<p><strong>Almost as equally impressive is the WHS girls 1st XI Hockey team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The girls have only had two losses throughout the season are still sitting top of the table as they head into the semi-finals of the division 1 Manawatu girls competition</strong> <strong>in Palmerston North tonight.</strong></p>
<p>The WHS girls will be playing Horowhenua in the semi-final hoping to cement a place in the final in Palmerston North next week.</p>
