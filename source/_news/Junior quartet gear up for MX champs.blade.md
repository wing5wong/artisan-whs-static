<p class="element element-paragraph">Four Whanganui riders will saddle up for the New Zealand Junior Motocross Championships in Mosgiel this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hosted by the Mosgiel District Motorcycle Club, the event will involve five races over two days on April 21-22 and the Whanganui riders each have aspiration to at least finish in the top 10 of their specific classes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The eledest, <strong>James Rountree</strong>, will be competing in the 15-16 years 125cc class riding a Bike Torque Yamaha YZ125cc. Rountree is fresh from the New Zealand Senior Motocross Championships where he finished a creditable ninth. He will be looking for a top 10 finish at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Oliver Dennison</strong> has been showing some good form and he will be competing in the 14-16 year 250cc class on his Husquanva 250 where he's also hoping for a top 10 finish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Jaxon Watt</strong> over the past 12 months has made big improvements finishing out of the top 20 at last year's nationals, but he also is looking for a top 10 placing on his Kawasaki KX85cc machine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Watts had just been awarded Most Improved Junior title at the Wanganui Motorcycle Club Awards.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youngest, at 11, is Jet Ashworth riding an Italian-built TM85 will be competing in the 10-12 year 85cc class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Last year Ashworth competed in Tahiti where he finished fourth in his class and hopefully that form can bring him through for a top placing at the weekend. In 2016 the youngster finished sixth at the New Zealand Mini Nationals.</p>
