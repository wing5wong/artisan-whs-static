<p>When Whanganui doctor Sandra Moore decided it was time to retire, she didn't have to look far for her replacement.</p>
<p>Her son, Chris Jacques, 29, has taken over Dr Moore's position as joint partner at Aramoho Health Centre.</p>
<p>Dr Moore has been at the health centre since it was built about 28 years ago.</p>
<p>Dr Jacques decided at the age of 17 to become a doctor, although his mother was not a fan of the idea.</p>
<p>"She actually discouraged me because she knew what a challenging life [being a doctor] was," Dr Jacques said.</p>
<p>"But having a parent as a doctor meant there was always a possibility that I would become one too, because I have that role model."</p>
<p>The pair did not plan for Dr Jacques to take his mother's place, but it all fell into place over the past few months.</p>
<p>"Two years ago when Chris said he was interested in being a GP I had it in the back of my mind that he might one day want to take over from me," Dr Moore said.</p>
<p>Recently Dr Jacques has been working as a GP in Palmerston North and at the Wicksteed House Medical Centre in Whanganui.</p>
<p>Dr Moore said the Aramoho Health Centre had been an important part of her life for nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>"So it's nice to see the next generation of doctors coming through. I'm pleased to be able to hand over to someone that I know and trust."</p>
<p>Practice nurse Sue Crawley is helping with the transition period from mother to son.</p>
<p>"She's been with me 23 years, so my patients have known her for a long time and she provides that continuity," Dr Moore said.</p>
<p>Dr Moore will continue to work with patients at Kowhainui retirement home for another year before she retires "properly".</p>
<p>And she has clear plans for what she intends to do in her retirement.</p>
<p>"Look after Chris's kids, do the gardening, go out for coffee with friends."</p>
