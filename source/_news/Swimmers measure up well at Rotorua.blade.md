<p class="element element-paragraph">A team of seven young Whanganui swimmers aged between 12 and 14 gained valuable experience at the New Zealand Division 2 meet in Rotorua last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With over 500 competitors, a number of whom swum huge personal bests, the Toyota-sponsored Whanganui Swim Team came home with a <strong>bronze medalist in 14-year-old Lennart Nowak</strong> who was part of the Allstars (Lower North Island) relay team. There were also some fine swims by the individuals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Nowak</strong> also picked up 5th placing in the 50 metre freestyle, dipping under 27 seconds for the first time, and swam some excellent personal best times in his other swim.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Thirteen-year-old <strong>Cheyenne Nightingale</strong> picked up 6th in the 800m freestyle and 8th place (equivalent of making a final) in the 400m free knocking almost 10 seconds off her personal best in both events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She showed great resilience after having her $300 race suit stolen to round off the meet with a 9th placing in the 400m IM in a borrowed suit in a personal best time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's other top 10 finish came from 12-year-old Nikki Forlong who finished 7th in the same 800m freestyle event as <strong>Nightingale</strong> with a 12 second pb.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The remainder of the team, <strong>Blair Gowan</strong>, Jack Robertson, <strong>Lucy Somerville and Ben White, all swam personal best times</strong> at the meet and the performances underlined the growing depth that the team now has.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A special mention needs to be made of the boys club relay teams who had two 14-year-olds (<strong>Nowak and Gowan</strong>), a 13-yearold (<strong>White</strong>) and a 12-year-old (Robertson) who raced in the 18 and under events and finished a creditable 17th in the freestyle relay and 19th in the medley relay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The next event for the Toyota Whanganui team is the National Age Group Campionships in April where a team of six girls and one boy will race for national titles in Auckland.</p>
