On Sunday 28 July two former Whanganui High School students Brylee Noble and Leila Collinson received the Duke of Edinburgh Hillary Award Gold at Government House. Dame Patsy Reddy was in attendance.

Both girls referenced the Adventurous journey as being one of their highlights. Brylee did the hiking expedition, while Leila did the kayaking expedition. Both girls mentioned the comradery and fun they had while they were out in the wilds! 

This year we were fortunate to have Mr Adams and his wife at the ceremony. Craig Adams has been organising and accompanying our WHS students on countless expeditions for many years and so it was fitting that he attended the ceremony as well.

Brylee has just returned for a two year adventure working in London, while Leila is in her first year at University in wellington, and so it was a real pleasure to catch up with these fine young women.
