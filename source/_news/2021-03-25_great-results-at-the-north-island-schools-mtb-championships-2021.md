Arlo Johnston and George Davies recently returned from a successful 2 days of MTB racing in Auckland at the North Island Schools MTB Championships.

Both did very well on Day 1 for the Enduro Event, with Arlo taking 4th place and George only a mere 4 seconds behind in 7th place out of more than 50 riders in the U17 age group.

The following day was the Downhill Event. Unfortunately George crashed in practice earlier in the day but still managed a creditable 17th place while **Arlo finished with the 3rd fastest time in U17â€™s giving him a spot on the podium!**

Awesome racing guys!!
