<p>Former WHS students Ethan Robinson and Jesse Kemp have been selected for the Jock Hobbs Under 19 Tournament in Taupo this month.</p>
<p>Whanganui youth rugby has its strongest representation in the New Zealand Heartland XV yet, with six players selected for the Jock Hobbs Under 19 Tournament in Taupo this month.</p>
<p>After the NZCT Wanganui under-20 team successfully retained their Hurricanes regional title in Palmerston North last weekend, they will make up the largest group of players in the Heartland team, which includes representatives from all 12 amateur unions.</p>
<p>It is big news for the Taihape club with hooker Todd Parkinson, prop Dylan Gallien and lock Hamish Bennett all chosen, alongside prop Gabriel Hakaraia (Ruapehu), second-five <strong>Ethan Robinson</strong> (Kaierau) and fullback <strong>Jessy Kemp</strong> (Ngamatapouri).</p>
<p>The call up is redemption for Hakaraia, who was chosen for the 2015 Heartland U19's but pulled out pre-tournament with injury.</p>
<p>Since starting in 2014, the national under 19 tournament has consisted of 16 teams - one squad each from the Mitre 10 Cup unions plus a second Auckland team and the Heartland side.</p>
<p>The Heartland team will play in the second-tier of the tournament for the Michael Jones Trophy at Owen Delany Park in Taupo.</p>
<p>Mark Rutene takes over as head coach after being assistant coach last year.</p>
<p>"There are at least seven or eight of the players who have played in the senior Heartland teams," he said.</p>
<p>"The tournament recognises the boys who remain playing for their Heartland unions, but they can still be a part of a New Zealand set up.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">"However, the challenge is different from the other teams, as the squad is made up of at least one player from each Heartland union.</span></p>
<p>"It means we arrive on the Monday and then only have three training runs before we play our first game.</p>
<p>"Most of the other teams have been together for at least 6-8 weeks and have played half a dozen games."</p>
<p>At the first tournament in 2014, Heartland did very well by beating Tasman, losing a high scoring game to Southland, then comfortably accounting for Hawke's Bay.</p>
<p>The locals in that team were Zyon Hekenui (Ruapehu), Mitchell Overton (Taihape), James Brett (Hunterville) and <strong>Kameli Kuruyabaki</strong> (then Pirates, now Kaierau/former WHS).</p>
<p>Last year the side was not as successful with defeats to Counties Manukau and Northland, but finished well with a win over Auckland B.</p>
<p>Taylor Transom (Taihape), <strong>Joe Edwards</strong> and <strong>Dominic Broadhead</strong> (both Kaierau/former WHS) were in that team, while Hakaraia was selected but injured.</p>
<p>The 2016 edition of the tournament starts on September 15.</p>
