<p>SWAN SONG: Shirley McDouall School of Dance graduating students. Front row, from left, Megan Hoskin and <strong>Aleisha Rainey</strong> (WHS). Back row, from left, Zsofia Hermann, <strong>Sarah Miller</strong> (WHS),<strong> Brianna Hobson</strong> (WHS), and Megan de Klerk. These students will be performing at Prince Edward Auditorium today.</p>
<p>Shirley McDouall School of Dance will hold a special graduation concert today.</p>
<p>School principal Melissa Tate said it was the first time the school had held a graduating concert. It was prompted by six of its senior students leaving Wanganui - and the school - at the end of this year.</p>
<p>"We do a big production every 18 months. Our next one isn't until April next year, which means that these students will miss out. We wanted them to leave on a high note," Miss Tate said.</p>
<p>The senior school - students from Grade 4 and above - will take part in the concert, with all six students performing solos.</p>
<p>"It's a short concert, and there will be snippets of different ballets, as well as contemporary and modern dance."</p>
<p>Miss Tate said the school wanted to acknowledge the students.</p>
<p>"They've been dancing with us almost on a daily basis, so it's a very long time they've dedicated to dance."</p>
<p>Four of the six students have been at the Shirley McDouall School of Dance since a very young age. <strong>Sarah Miller</strong>, 17, started when she was 7; while Zsofia Hermann, 17, <strong>Brianna Hobson</strong>, 18, and<strong> Aleisha Rainey</strong>, 18, began dance when they were 3 years old. The other two graduating dancers, Megan Hoskin and Megan de Klerk, joined the school when they were older.</p>
<p>They all study ballet, and a variety of other dance styles such as contemporary and modern.</p>
<p>All six plan to continue dancing once they leave Wanganui.</p>
<p><strong>Brianna</strong>, Zsofia, and <strong>Aleisha</strong> are all moving to Dunedin to study health studies at Otago University. <strong>Aleisha</strong> wants to be a physiotherapist, Zsofia plans to go on to study medicine or dentistry, and <strong>Brianna</strong> hasn't decided yet.</p>
<p>Sarah is moving to Wellington to study languages at Victoria University.</p>
<p>Miss Tate said the students had also been successful academically.</p>
<p>Zsofia was head of academics at Wanganui Collegiate this year and has just been named school dux and <strong>Aleisha</strong> is Wanganui High school's sports dux.</p>
<p>The students' love of dance is obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah</strong> fell in love with ballet after going to a show as a child.</p>
<p>"It was something that I'd always wanted to do. It kind of takes over your life after a while."</p>
<p><strong>Brianna</strong> said dance required a lot of commitment, but it was all worth it.</p>
<p>"Dance is a lot of hard work, and you wake up the next morning and your muscles are sore, but you still go the next day because you love it.</p>
<p><strong>Aleisha</strong> said she felt a lot of pressure to do well in sport and academics, but dance was "an outlet".</p>
<p>"I have a good group of friends here, and I just enjoy dancing."</p>
<p>Zsofia said she loves the opportunity to be graceful while also getting a good workout.</p>
<p>All the students paid tribute to Miss Tate.</p>
<p>"She's put a lot of work into us, and she is so dedicated to all her students."</p>
<p>-Shirley McDouall School of Dance graduation concert, today, 2pm, Prince Edward Auditorium. Tickets at door [cash only], adults $10, children $8.</p>
