Tough Guy / Gal 2025 \*edited\*

On Friday the 23rd of May, WHS took 35 students to the lower North Island Tough Guy/Gal competition held at Camp Wainui, Wainuiomata just out of Wellington.

It was a tough 6 km course, with over 900 students from year 9 to 13. There were over 30 schools represented. The students completed the 6 km which involved running up hills, through rivers, muddy swamps, up cargo nets, under electric and barbed wire fences. It was a great day with lots of smiling faces and sore legs at the end.

Special mention to Zak Papworth who came 2nd, Lennox Brotherton finishing in 3rd, Darcy Johnston 13th and Hadley Wilson 14th out of 962 finishers.   Well done to Ethan Toy who also finished 2nd in the junior boys.  This gave us the title of Toughest male school. Also, Hannah Cameron finished 4th out of the junior girls which was a great effort.

Well done to everybody involved.
