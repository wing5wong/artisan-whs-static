The Whanganui Secondary Schools Athletics Champs were held on Tuesday 18th March.  Some great results from our WHS students and they were great representatives of our school.  Unfortunately, the rain didn't stay away and some field events got postponed until the evening of Tuesday 25th March. 

A big thanks to Sport Whanganui for another well run event.  Thanks to Mr Rivers for his assistance with long jump and Mr Coombs for being the starter for the track races and thanks to our athletics coaches, Greg Fromont and Elaine Baker.
