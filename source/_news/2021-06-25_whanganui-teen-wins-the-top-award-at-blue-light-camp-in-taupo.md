**Whanganui teenager, Cyprus Lily Hill (16), walked away with the top award at the recent Blue Light Life Skills programme held in Taupo from 31 May to 4 June. Cyprus, who attends Whanganui High School, beat an exceptional group of young people from across Aotearoa to win the competitive Overall Excellence Award.** 

Blue Light Life Skills Coordinator, Saagar Deo commented, “Cyprus was awarded the Overall Excellence Award through demonstrating the whakataukī of maturity, respect, intuition and through building individual and group mana”. 

The highly successful Life Skills programme has been run by New Zealand Blue Light in partnership with NZ Defence Force for the past 12 years and has adventure-based experiential learning as a key part of the programme. The programme provides 14-17-year olds’ critical life skills such as self-development, self-control and teamwork that will enable young people to be successful at home, school, communities and employment. 

Up to 12 courses are held each year in Auckland, Central North Island and Burnham locations.

Blue Light is grateful for the support of the sponsorship of the Lion Foundation and community supporters. 

***New Zealand Blue Light***  
Blue Light is a not-for-profit charity that works in partnership with the Police to create positive connections between young people and the Police, helping young people find direction, fun, and sense of belonging within their communities, enabling young people to develop life skills, leadership skills and find employment opportunities. 

Blue Light believes that it is through the empowerment of disadvantaged youth to reach their full potential that their overall wellbeing can be improved and, in turn, the wellbeing of their communities. 

Blue Light achieves this through removing the barriers for disadvantaged youth to participate positively in the community through both its national and locally-based programmes, activities and events. 

Blue Light’s work in the community is unique – it is not a one size fits all approach. We have 68 local branches working with NZ Police to create meaningful experiences for young people in their regions, including cultural, sporting and educational activities that are alcohol, drug and violence free. 

Although Blue Light is supported by Police, the two operate totally independently. 

For many participants, the programmes decrease the risk of youth offending and becoming victims of crime through access to positive role models, time with other young people away and the opportunity to see the world outside their current environment. 

Blue Light originally began in Australia as a community policing initiative and remains very strong in all the Australian states. As well as in New Zealand, it is now active in the Solomon Islands, East Timor, Cook Islands, and Scotland.
