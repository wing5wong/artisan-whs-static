The Lyric Singers' mid-year concert was a poignant occasion as the 36-strong choir bid farewell to their long-time musical director, Joanna Love.

Joanna and her husband Pat McNamara arrived in Whanganui 2013 and Joanna took over the choir baton in 2015. Last Saturday's concert, entitled *We Shall Overcome*, was her final stint at the front.

The concert, held at Trinity Methodist Church in Wicksteed St, was well attended and featured accomplished musicians as guest artists.

Russian Roulette comprises Bethany Crosse (violin), Melody Crosse (violin) and Emma Akkerman (piano). They played five pieces by Dmitri Shotakovich and the audience loved them.

Well known in musical and education circles is Annie Hunt, cellist extraordinaire, who played a selection of Irish folk tunes and *Tarantella for Cello and Piano*. She was accompanied by the choir's pianist, Lisa Boessenkool.

The Latecomers are a quintet from the Lyric Singers who entertained with a selection that included *Jamaican Farewell* as well *Old McDonald's Farm* in a four-song bracket. Marie Brooks accompanied on piano.


With conductor Joanna Love, accompanist Lisa Boessenkool and with Anderina McLean compering, the choir presented a programme as varied as it was entertaining.

From spirituals to sacred songs, contemporary numbers and songs well-suited to choral arrangements, the choir provided a solid send-off for Joanna and an afternoon of delight for its audience.

Their guests were first class and the concert was memorable for all the right reasons.
