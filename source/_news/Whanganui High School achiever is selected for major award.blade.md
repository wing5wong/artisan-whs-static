<p class="element element-paragraph">A Whanganui High School student has won a nationwide scholarship.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alister Hughes, 17, was one of five students selected from throughout New Zealand for a New Zealand Grant. The grant provides the students, who must be from decile 1-5 schools, with tutoring, expert advice and resources to perform at their very best in the upcoming NCEA and NZQA Scholarship exams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The programme was launched by Crimson Education and will connect each of the recipients to a scholarship strategist, as well as mentoring, tutoring and a range of services offered to prepare students for the end of year exams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alister is currently in Year 13 and studying calculus, statistics, Cambridge mathematics, biology, English literature, chemistry and history. Next year he hopes to take on a bachelor of law and bachelor of arts conjoint degree, majoring in philosophy and public Policy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alister is the head prefect for academia at Whanganui High School, and also plays the piano. He is heavily involved in debating and coaches junior teams at his school. He was recently chosen as reserve for the New Zealand Secondary Schools debating team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School principal, Martin McAllen, said the school was "incredibly proud" of Alister.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Alister is a self-driven, well-rounded young man and he has a very bright future ahead of him. What is also very exciting is that past Whanganui High School student, Amaan Merchant, who was a nationwide premier scholar in 2015, will be involved with mentoring Alister."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Crimson co-founder and CEO Jamie Beaton said the organisation aims to inspire an "aspirational spirit" in students across New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Students will gain exceptional critical thinking skills, time management skills and aptitude in a range of subject areas by undertaking the New Zealand Scholarship Examinations, with support from those who have recently succeeded in them," Mr Beaton said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Students were interviewed and selected for the grant based on potential to succeed, passion for subjects, drive to do well and whether there was a focus on giving back to the community.</p>
