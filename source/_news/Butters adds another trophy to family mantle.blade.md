<p><strong>Whanganui's Paris Butters continued her family's fine legacy at the 2016 Dunlop Slazenger Wanganui Open by winning the women's open singles and doubles titles for the first time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In a small women's open draw of six players, including four locals, WHS student, Butters dominated the competition.</strong></p>
<p>"She lost only four games in five matches. She won 60," said Wanganui Tennis Club development officer Gene Ridgway.</p>
<p><strong>Butters</strong> then went on with clubmate Kate Davey to win the small doubles draw.</p>
<p>Despite the one-sided nature of the scorelines, which were played in round robin rather than single elimination, the 18-year-old <strong>Butters</strong> said her wins were not over inferior opponents.</p>
<p>"I had a few decent games, I've definitely improved from how I used to hit.</p>
<p>"They gave me a good run, it just came out in the end. Just go hard in every single game."</p>
<p>The most entertaining match of the open draw did not involve Butters, as Davey was beaten by Manawatu's Rebekah Leung-Wai in the final tiebreak 10-4, after a two hour clash in the first round.</p>
<p><strong>Butters</strong> followed in the footsteps of cousin Paige Hourigan, who was the last women's open champion in 2013, while older brother and former WHS student,&nbsp;<strong>Kyle Butters</strong> won the men's open.</p>
<p>She herself had previously claimed the 16 Year crown, and as a second generation player after her parents, <strong>Butters</strong> could not recall how many open titles the family have now accumulated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I've lost count, it's quite a few.</p>
<p>"Quite proud to keep it going. It means a lot."</p>
<p>It was a much stronger men's draw with 21 entries playing elimination format.</p>
<p>Locals Martin Sosnowski, <strong>Sam Russell</strong> (WHS student), Craig Davey and Patrice Mahey all entered, with Mahey going the furthermost until being eliminated in the quarterfinals by No1 seed Sam Newman from Wellington.</p>
<p>Newman went onto the final against surprise opponent Caleb Fleming, as the New Plymouth player was seeded 5th but beat the No2 seed in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Newman would eventually win a good matchup 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>In the junior grades, Petone's Brooke Morgan won the five player round-robin for the 10 Year girls, with Hawera's Abby Ross finishing second.</p>
<p>There were 10 entries for the 10 Year boys, playing two pools of five with the top performer from each making the final.</p>
<p>George Frederick-Baird defeated his Wellington clubmate Marcus Ruane to lift the crown.</p>
<p>It was a very strong field of 30 entries for the 14 year boys, with Taranaki's No2 seed Jayden Harrison winning the final 6-4 6-1 against Lower Hutt No3 seed Jake Naylor.</p>
<p>There were 14 players in the 14 Year girls, and Palmerston North's No1 seed Hannah Sutherland-Smith claimed the title against great underdog Chi-chi Beck from Greytown, who had previously defeated the No2 and No5 seeds on the way to the final.</p>
<p>The remaining doubles finals were wrapping up at press time yesterday.</p>
<p>Action continues today and concludes tomorrow with the 16 Year and 12 Year grades.</p>
<p>In total, 130 players have entered the Open, just three less than 2015, with many of the younger players taking part in multiple age grades as there are 239 overall entries as of yesterday.</p>
<p>"Seventy per cent are playing all four days," said Ridgway.</p>
