<p><span>LAUNCH READY: Physics whiz Rhaz Solomon of Wanganui High School will gain astronautic experience at Space Camp in America.</span></p>
<p>Wanganui High School student Rhaz Solomon is off to Space Camp in Alabama, US, to attend the International Advanced Space Academy.</p>
<p>Rhaz was chosen, along with five other New Zealand students, for his genuine interest in space science and his intention to study science at tertiary level next year.</p>
<p>"I'm not actually studying physics this year because I completed Level 3 last year," said the Year 13 student.</p>
<p>" I am really looking forward to the space science experiences and putting the theory into practice."</p>
<p>Rhaz and the other Kiwis will be joined by more than 150 students from 23 different countries at the camp, where they will gain hands-on experience in astronaut training - learning about the mental, emotional and physical challenges astronauts face.</p>
<p>There will be opportunities to experience scuba diving, four Gs of lift-off force and weightlessness in the space simulator.</p>
<p>The students will be funded to by the Talented School Students Travel Award, administered by the Royal Society of NZ and funded by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.</p>
<p>Rhaz and the other five New Zealand students will leave for the US in July.</p>
