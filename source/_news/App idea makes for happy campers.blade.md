<p class="element element-paragraph">EMMA RUSSELL continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each night before bed Adam Hutchinson would chip away at a project he saw as "just a fun hobby".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since then his hobby has transitioned into an award-winning smartphone app for tourists - not to mention an international operation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The former Whanganui High School student said his success story started after he got yarning to some tourists about troubles they'd been having getting around the place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I found that a lot of international tourists were paying a lot of money to come to New Zealand but once they got on the road they struggled to find things like public toilets or a nearby campsites."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After finishing his studies at Lincoln University Adam contacted all the councils around New Zealand and requested all data locating public toilets, dump stations and campsites.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was able to get 6000 GPS co-ordinates of these places around New Zealand and put together a small group of friends who were developers."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And so came the idea of a smartphone app he called CamperMate.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Adam said the timing of the launch could not have been better.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were able to get it up and running at the time of the 2011 Rugby World Cup - when every campsite in New Zealand was booked out."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So what did Adam and his team do?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They hopped on a campervan of their own, visited all the popular campsites and cooked free bacon and eggs for tourists while getting them hooked up on to their free app.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Adam said it was great to get the ball rolling but the 6000 GPS co-ordinates they got from the councils was only a small part of the picture.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What worked was there was a function we created in the app that would crowd-source new locations so users could add spots with our verification.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I would sit there at the end of each day and manually verify all of these submissions that were coming through."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In two years they were able to turn 6000 GPS co-ordinates into 13,000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Taking it a step further, Adam went on to promote campsites and other tourist hotspots through his app that rebranded to GeoZone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Creating this network of apps for companies is when my hobby became a business because we were able to grab on to this advertising opportunity."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He now has more than 37,000 people using GeoZone in New Zealand and Australia and he has every kilometre across New Zealand covered.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Adam sold GeoZone to Tourism Holdings in 2015 but still maintains an active role within the company.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said as a start-up company it can be difficult establishing credibility but the acquisition was really good.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It not only gave us credibility within the industry but also a really great partner to work with.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We got in this to create new innovative ideas and it's been great to continue to explore that with the backing we needed."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Adam has also worked with Whanganui's former mayor Annette Main to create a civil defence emergency alert for tourists to warn them of a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said he will continue to work with local councils on projects like this in the future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The advice he has for students considering diving into their own start-up company is to find something they are really passionate about.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Quite often on those down times when things are really difficult it's going to be that passion that drives you forward."</p>
