Whilst it is not unusual for families to continue in professions established by their parents, having two musical families in Whanganui continue a professional musical tradition is very special. “Like Mother, Like Daughter” is a unique music ensemble comprising mothers, Winifred Livesay (soprano) and Ingrid Culliford (flute) with their daughters, **Abigail Livesay (piano) and Elena Morgan (cello).**

Ingrid and Win have performed together for many years and taught each other’s daughters the piano so there is a long history which has built strong relationships over many years. They are delighted to offer a varied programme of music by women composers as part of La Fiesta 2020 on Sunday, February 9, at 4pm in the Jane Winstone Chapel, Jane Winstone Retirement Village.

From Hildegard of Bingen in the 12th century through to the present day, women have made significant contributions to classical music which have often been overlooked. Until late in the 20th century women had been actively discouraged, or even barred, from pursuing careers writing music, which was inherently thought to be something only men could and should, do.

Some of these women composers are now known, for example Fanny Mendelssohn, who published many of her songs under the name of her brother Felix, or Clara Schumann, who has emerged from the shadows of her more famous husband Robert, as it was the 200th anniversary of her birth last year and more of her music has been performed. There are many such stories of the women behind some wonderful music.

Like Mother, Like Daughter invite you to share the music of French Romantic composer, Louise Farrenc, the beautiful Sicilienne of Marie-Therese von Paradis, New Zealander Dorothy Buchanan’s setting of poems by Hone Tuwhare – Five Songs from No Ordinary Sun, along with music by other NZ composers, Dame Gillian Whitehead, Helen Fisher and Claire Cowan, whose recent score of music for NZ Ballet’s “Hansel and Gretel” was highly acclaimed.

Tickets are available in advance from the Royal Wanganui Opera House, or at the door (cash only, no eftpos). Adults – $25.00, seniors and supporters $20.00, students $5.00.
