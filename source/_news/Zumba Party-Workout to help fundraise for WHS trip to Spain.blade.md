<p class="BasicParagraph">Senior Spanish students from Whanganui High School will be going to Spain next year in the July holidays. They will be accompanied by four teachers and three parents with a total of 35 people. One of the teachers is Queralt Scott, who comes from Barcelona. One of her sons will also be on the trip.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">They are starting to do some fund raising to reduce the cost for each individual. First up is a Zumba evening. It will be held in the Seddon Gym and the instructor is Yehymy from Columbia. This is particularly appropriate as Zumba is a dance/aerobic fitness programme created by Colombian dancer and choreographer, Alberto Perez in the 1990s. It features various styles of Latin American dance and performed primarily to Latin American dance music</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">Queralt, helped by student Gabrielle Sturdee, came up with the idea and together are organising a series of Zumba &lsquo;party/workouts.&rsquo; Queralt says, &ldquo;If people have done it before, they will know how much fun it is and if they are new to it I am sure they will also come to future sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><strong>The first Zumba party/workout is at the Seddon Gym at WHS from 6 to 7pm on Wednesday, November 21. The cost is $5.</strong></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">She says, &ldquo;Spanish is getting more and more popular in New Zealand. We have a great languages department at High School and it is so rewarding seeing how more and more students are choosing to learn foreign languages as an option from years 10 to 13.&rdquo; She adds, &ldquo;We are so proud seeing how the numbers of students choosing Spanish are increasing year after year.&rdquo;</p>
