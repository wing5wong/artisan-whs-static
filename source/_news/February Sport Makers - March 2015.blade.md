<p>Mikal Terrey, one of February's winning Lotto Volunteers.</p>
<p>Another two sport volunteers have earned themselves $500 worth of sports gear and merchandise each, through the Lotto Volunteers "Thank A Sport Maker" campaign. Surprisingly though, the opportunity to win this prize is not being taken up in the numbers that would be expected.<br />The Lotto Volunteers Thank a Sport Maker campaign rewards two sport volunteers in our region every month, by collecting nominations from the community via electronic thank you cards.<br />There were was only one volunteer nominated for February across the whole of the Wanganui region, including Rangitikei and Ruapehu. Compared to other regions around the country, Wanganui is lagging distinctly behind in coming forwards to thank sport volunteers.<br />On the plus side, for those that have been nominated, the chances of winning are extremely high because the pool of nominees is so low. And with two winners drawn every month, the chances are getting higher all the time.<br />February winners Trevor Kauika and Mikal Terrey were both in the running for the prize because they received a thank you card and accepted the invitation to be in the draw.<br />Trevor Kauika was nominated for his work with Te Ringa Miti Tai Heke Whanganui Waka Ama. Trevor is one of the club's main coaches and spends many hours on the water's edge working with the junior teams. Said his well-wisher, "He doesn't just coach club teams but has supported lots of school teams over the last two years. Trevor has also made paddles for junior members so they have the right equipment without it costing them. He does all the club maintenance fixing up waka or other equipment."<br />Mikal Terrey, a student at Wanganui High School is one of a number of secondary school students that were thanked for their volunteer efforts at the recent NZ Secondary School Track and Field and Road Race champs at Cooks Gardens.<br />&brvbar;Volunteers that accept their nomination will stay in the running for the 12 months of the campaign.</p>
<p>For those nominating the volunteers, the thank-you cards are quick and easy to send, and can be found on the Sport Whanganui website www.sportwhanganui.co.nz.</p>
