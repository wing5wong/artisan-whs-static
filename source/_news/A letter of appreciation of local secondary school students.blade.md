<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Ann Butler sent River City Press the following letter:</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">&ldquo;A group of friends from a local high school had an evening out at the weekend. They were going to the pictures and decided that they would go to a local restaurant for a meal beforehand.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">During the meal, a man from another table came up to them and asked where were they from. He complimented them on the respect they had shown to the staff who were waiting on them and for the respect they showed the other people dining at the restaurant.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The eight boys and one girl thanked him and continued with their meal. When they had finished they got up to pay their account when the same man came up to the counter and told the cashier that he wanted to pick up the tab for their meal as he was so impressed with them all &ndash; he paid just over $270. The group obviously thanked him very much and made their way to the pictures. </span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">However, they went to the supermarket first and bought two boxes of chocolates for the man and his wife to say thank you for their generosity.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">"These students are not prefects, not sport stars and possibly low key students at school but what a compliment to them. Whanganui High School, their parents and the boys and the girl, should be very proud of themselves.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
