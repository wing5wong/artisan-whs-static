The senior girls volleyball team went to Taranaki on Friday to play Waitara High School and Spotswood College.  

The girls had fundraised money to go to summer tournament in March, so when it was cancelled it was decided to have a trip as 7 of the team were year 13's.  

We did not win either game but thoroughly enjoyed the games and the hospitality from the Taranaki teams.  

The girls stayed overnight in New Plymouth and came back Saturday after enjoying a bit of shopping and a look around New Plymouth.
