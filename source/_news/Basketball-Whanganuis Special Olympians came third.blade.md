There was tremendous excitment for a group of Whanganui's Special Olympians (which included former student Aaron Johnson (back row, 2nd from left) and WHS TeAtawhai staff member, Carla Davies - back row, 3rd from left) who came third in both of their basketball divisions at the Special Olympics Manawatu tournament at Central Energy Trust Arena last weekend.</p>
<p>Entered at 'Emerging' level against teams from Taranaki, Upper Hutt, Wellington and Waikato, Whanganui took a boys team and a mixed team, having to change from an all-girls squad due to illnesses.</p>
<p>Sam Beatson-Shaw was the coach.</p>
<p>Most of the larger provinces entered 2-3 teams in both levels and grades.</p>
<p>Whanganui chairwoman Jan Bublitz said both of their teams qualified for the playoffs on the second day, where they won two matches to come third.</p>
<p>For all but a couple of them, it was their first time playing competitively, and the two teams were in high spirits throughout.</p>
