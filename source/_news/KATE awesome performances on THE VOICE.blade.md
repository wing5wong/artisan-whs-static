<p><strong>Former WHS student Kate Van Elswijk made it to the Battle Rounds of The Voice Australia, June 2016.</strong></p>
<p>Kate's visual impairment hasn't prevented her love of playing the guitar and piano, and she impressed the coaches with a beautiful performance of 'People Help The People' in the Blind Audition of The Voice on 15 May. &nbsp;Ronan Keating turned his chair for Kate's amazing performance.</p>
<p>Then on 5 June it was the battle of the angelic voices of Kate and Georgia Carey who sang 'Believe' to stay on Team Ronan in the Battle Rounds.</p>
<p>Georgia won the round, but Kate was certainly one of the favourites.</p>
<p>Well done Kate, we were thrilled for you!</p>
