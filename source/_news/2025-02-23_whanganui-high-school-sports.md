Well done Āria Hill for an outstanding week of shooting.  

Aria has been shooting daily for the last week. She won her grade, and was on the NZ Women's Junior Team, and made the NZ Open Team! 

She was second in 50m Junior Women's  Prone, and first in her grade 2x60 shot.  She  was also part of the Dewar Team and the Women's Randle team which are international matches.

Amazing Āria!!
