<p><span>Whanganui's Jessica Tyson runner up in the Miss Global City.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A born and raised Whanganui local has returned home with a new crown after competing in an international beauty pageant held in China.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former WHS student, Jessica Tyson, 24, of Te Atihaunui-a-Paparangi, was crowned second overall on Saturday after competing against 31 other contestants from around the world at the Miss Global City pageant in Shanghai.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Miss Global City had girls enter representing the largest cities in the world with a purpose to promote charities to protect people and the earth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What I loved so much about this pageant was being able to spend more time hanging out with the other contestants and building some really good friendships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Towards the end I wasn't expecting to place because I knew there were so many other girls who were amazing. So when my name was called out as a winner I was so surprised."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as a top five placing, Jess also won the Best in Speech Award which focused on poverty.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I spoke about my role as a journalist and the voice I have for those who are living in poverty.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"With homelessness and child poverty being so high in New Zealand I used the time to talk about how I am doing my part to help poverty by uncovering the truth about people living in poverty in New Zealand."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Activities that contestants took part in during the trip included charity events, sailing, visiting cultural spots and Disney Land.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My favourite was being able to go to Disney Land because it was a once in a lifetime experience and the place was amazing. Miss Australia and I were the only girls who had time to go so we were so lucky."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jess moved from Whanganui to Auckland in 2012 to study a Bachelor of Communication Studies majoring in journalism then spent a year studying te reo Māori fulltime. She now works for Te Kaea News at Māori Television.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Miss Global City was Jess' third time competing in an international beauty pageant representing New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 2008 she won the Miss Teen World Supermodel pageant in Australia. Last year she placed second at Miss World New Zealand and represented the country again at the Miss International pageant in Tokyo.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"From this point onwards I really want to focus on developing my career by continuing to learn te reo but I definitely want to compete internationally again because the experiences I have at these competitions have been some of the best I've every had."</p>
