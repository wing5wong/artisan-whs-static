**Caleb Isaacs** is a songwriter and musician from Christchurch although he lived in Whanganui for six years of his life until he was 14 playing music at Faith City Church and at **Whanganui High School**. He will be playing at Lucky Bar with his band on Thursday, February 13. Doors open at 8pm with support from local, Grace Zannetta. Tickets $15 on the door or from www.caleb.co.nz for $10.

Caleb has been writing songs since he was about 15 years old. Honing his musicianship playing at bars and weddings around Christchurch for the last five years, he’s turned into a barn-storming front-man with a command of the stage and his music, performing ‘songs with guts’.

Following on from “Plunder (E.P)” in 2018, Caleb’s first official release, he’s taken that rock ‘n roll fervour and given it some space and careful sonic treatment. More of his folky roots are brought into the fold as well as the crowd pleasing funk, rock ‘n roll and soul inspired party tunes.

A lyricist first and foremost, Caleb’s songs explore topics such as: money, self-belief, middleclass absurdities, love, drugs, depression and hope. His approach to performance wraps the heavy topics in light, fun bops and always brings the audience along for the ride.

Caleb will be accompanied by Brad Meyer (bass, backing vocals) and Cameron Lee (Drums).
