<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui rap group Machete Clan's grassroots rise has caught the eye of national television with the group to feature on Three's&nbsp;<em>Jono and Ben</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The show's Guy Williams was in Wanganui over the weekend filming with the group for a segment which will appear in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Machete Clan traces back to when Whanganui musician Isaac Chamberlain (former WHS student) began producing tracks in 2013.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was me making music and people came on and spit a rap here and there," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That settled into a group which became Machete Clan which has so far produced two albums and an EP.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it is 2016 single&nbsp;<em>On The Rark</em>&nbsp;which is helping Machete Clan spread from a small tight-knit Whanganui group to the rest of the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's sort of become an anthem," Chamberlain said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>On The Rark</em>&nbsp;is pushing 1.5 million streams on Spotify with the video being watched more than 350,000 times on Youtube.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They're remarkable numbers for an unprompted, DIY group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We just tapped into the right crowd I guess," Chamberlain said of the group's ironic, fun party raps based on the local Whanganui scene and slang.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everyone takes themselves so seriously making hip hop but our whole thing's got this exaggerated Whanganui bullshit."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Chamberlain, who is also a guitarist for Whanganui metal band Drxnes, said Machete Clan were working on another album and would be touring the country again at the end of the year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Jono and</em>&nbsp;Ben airs on Thursdays at 7.30pm but it was not yet known which week the Machete Clan segment will air.</p>
