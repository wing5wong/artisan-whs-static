<p>AWESOME QUARTET: &nbsp;Aiden Nossiter, Erica Tanner, Max Brown and Toby Brooke at Lake Karapiro.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Kayak Club claimed two golds amongst an eight-medal haul during Day 1 of the Canoe Racing New Zealand (CRNZ) Nationals at Lake Karapiro yesterday.</p>
<p>New Zealand junior representative Toby Brooke won the Under 18 1000m title, which doubles as an Oceania championship.</p>
<p>Club member Lisa Chase said although Brooke was not satisfied with his 3m 35s finishing time, he was still looking strong for the Australian GP2 in Sydney next week.</p>
<p>There was a Wanganui 1-2-3 finish in the Masters women's race with Robyn Scott, Kylie Gibson and Chase holding a monopoly on the podium, while together they looked strong in the K2 and K4 events at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Brooke's New Zealand squad mates Aiden Nossiter and Max Brown fought out a tough Under 23 1000m with Mana's Kurtis Imrie, who was Brown's K2 partner in winning the Blue Lakes Regatta in December.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Chase said it was a nailbiter at the finish line with Imrie leading Nossiter then Brown home.</span></p>
<p>Also just barely missing out on the top of the podium, by 0.2s, was Under 16 K2 team Cambell Tanner and Regan Davey in the 500m final.</p>
<p>Sapere Simon and Erica Tanner also came second in the Under 18 500m.</p>
<p>"This was a great effort for this duo as this is Simon's first national event and he is still only 15 years old," said Chase.</p>
<p>"Under 14 K2 500m paddlers Jack Clifton and Lucas Thompson did stunningly. The pair are first timers at nationals and as event commentator Ian Ferguson said, "these two have a bright future".</p>
<p>"They are young but have a lot of potential and are a super keen pair of youngsters fully involved in nationals."</p>
<p>Chase said the highlight of Day 1 was watching Olympic gold medallist Lisa Carrington winning the Open K1 500m race.</p>
<p>"Clubs emptying their tents to view the race of the world champion and Olympian. The 'pocket rocket' is without a doubt the reason for the increased participation in the sport."</p>
