Whanganui High School Year 13 student, Callista Booth-Richards was selected to go on a fully funded environment leadership trip called BLAKE Inspire from 5-9 October 2020.  The following is her story. 

BLAKE NZ is an organisation founded in the memory of Sir Peter Blake, the champion New Zealand sailor, explorer and environmental activist. BLAKE NZ focuses on inspiring environmental leadership in the youth of our country, following Sir Peter Blake's philosophy.
 
BLAKE Inspire is a week-long residential programme about environmental leadership and sustainability. 60 secondary students from all around NZ were chosen to fly up to the Waikato region for a fully funded week of learning about biodiversity, conservation, freshwater ecology, marine conservation, sustainable agriculture, environmental policy, and water health. 
 
We worked with NIWA marine scientists in the Raglan estuaries and did a kayak tour to see the ancient sea beds. We visited Waitomo glowworm caves to learn about ecotourism whilst doing tours with geologists, and black water rafting. We met with Fonterra farmers to learn about sustainable agriculture in NZ and their future plans. We also worked with NIWA freshwater scientists to learn about freshwater health and bug ecology in NZ waterways. And members from the ministry for the environment lead a workshop where we learnt about policy and took part in a policy simulation/debate about the Carbon Tax.
 
At the end of the week, each delegate presented action plans that we wanted to implement either in our communities or future. Mine was about using biotechnology and genetic engineering to increase sustainability in NZ, namely by using GMOs to make bioplastic far more eco-friendly to produce and providing education on the proper disposal of bioplastics. Students that are selected for BLAKE Inspire can then qualify to apply for BLAKE Expeditions. I plan to do so next year and hope to attend either the expedition to the Kermadec Islands or Sub-Antarctic Islands, as well as applying for BLAKE ambassador programmes with NIWA.
 
Overall this was a life-changing and valuable learning experience that I will take with me and incorporate into my future. I strongly encourage students to get involved and apply for the 2021 BLAKE Inspire programme, as BLAKE opens so many doors for students passionate about the environment, and gives them the resources and experiences to make a difference.
