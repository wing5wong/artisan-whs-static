<p><strong>LIFTING UP:&nbsp;An improved performance at the second round of the national motocross championships has moved James Rountree up into the Top 10 in points.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's James Rountree has moved into tenth place of the 125cc class after the second round of the New Zealand Senior Motocross Championships in Rotorua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 15-year-old Whanganui High School student is the youngest rider in the senior event, and was looking to recover from a couple of bad races at the first round of the championships three weeks ago, which left him 14th overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Rotorua, Rountree's placings were 13th, 12th and 10th, which saw him finish 11th overall for the day and move up four spots to the Top 10 of the series.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His performances on the Bike Torque Yamaha YZ125 got better as the day went on at a demanding track.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next round will be in Napier in two weeks, which is not as hard-packed and will suit the teenager.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The final round is in Taupo.</p>
