We are so proud to announce that Mostyn McDonald (Year 13) has  been selected as a finalist in the 2024 Arts House Trust Secondary School Awards.

His photograph was chosen from a pool of over 350 artworks, a huge achievement in itself. However, we wish you all the best for the results, announced on the 5th September. 

Well done Mostyn!
