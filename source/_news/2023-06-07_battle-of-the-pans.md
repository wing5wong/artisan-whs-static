Cooking competitions are always exciting, a little like a stage production. So many rehearsals and then the final performance, only our props are knives, stoves and smoke guns.

The Service IQ Battle of the Pans competition this year took place at Wellington East Girls College on the 3rd May. The early start always means packing everything in the dark. Ingredients, equipment, static entries, blazers, whites and eventually the competitors, virtually everything except the kitchen sink!

The journey to Wellington had one casualty in the form of a cupcake which decided to fall over but luckily we had a spare which could be made to look presentable.

Our competitors, from the Level Two Hospitality class, entered the static cupcake competition and the café cabinet cake, with one student entering the live cook café sandwich round. We were competing against Wellington East Girls, Tawa College and Hutt Valley.

The students gained certificates:-

 **                                                         Iced Cupcakes.**

\    Hannah James Year 12 - Caramellow -  **Bronze**

                                                          Madelyn Connole Year 12 - Cookies and Cream - **Silver**

                                                          **Café cake**

                                                          Olivia Cox  Year 12 -Choc full of raspberries - **Silver**

                                                          Madelyn Connole Year 12 - Pumpkin Daze - **Silver**

                                                         **Café Sandwich**

                                                         Hannah James Year 12 - Chicken Lickin’- **Gold**

Overall, Whanganui High School won the competition, with Hannah James being named as winner of the entire competition, winning a pair of digital scales; and as such we have been invited down to Government House for a tour of the residency and the kitchens.
