<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The 16-year-old continued his recent strong form by winning two age group titles.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>On his Yamaha YZ250f, Rountree won all three races in the 250cc 14-16 Years class to get the title.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>He also entered another Yamaha in the 125cc 15-16 Years class and picked up one win and two second placings to claim that title as well.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Antony Rountree said the clay-based track was slightly different to the events they usually enter, however James Rountree's experience at the recent Australian Junior Nationals in Tasmania &ndash; where he came 10th and 13th in his classes &ndash; helped him due to being similar.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Rountree also entered the Huka Honda MX Extravaganza at Labour Weekend, where he came fifth overall in the 125cc National class, which is an open grade.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Marton's Ethan Breuer, Whanganui's <strong>Seth Reardon</strong> and Hunterville's Hannah Rushworth will be aiming to shine when the 2018-19 Central Cross-country Series gets underway near Waipukurau on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leading motocross, cross-country and enduro riders all enter the popular series, which will consist of five rounds from November to April.</p>
