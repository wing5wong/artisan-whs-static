<p class="element element-paragraph">The early finish at Shelterview came too late for the two local contenders in the Group A and B divisions, whose title aspirations were upended by engine problems.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sitting second overall in Group A behind Hamilton's Ollie Silverton, Whanganui's Ross Travers, and by extension his son <strong>Shane</strong> (ex WHS student), who also competes in the Radioactive boat, had their day ended when the motor died on the fourth qualifying run.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the most simplest fault which also does the most permanent damage &ndash; a rod came loose and punctured the engine sump, which means the whole unit will need to be replaced.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Threw a lead out the sump. I felt it go," said Ross Travers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't see the smoke until it was [stopped] on the island and the smoke passed us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mathematically, the Group A title is gone and even finishing in the Top 3 for the season is unlikely, as Silverton (48.736s) finished runnerup for the day after the Top 9 to Christchurch's Simon Gibbon (48.451s), who had been sitting in sixth overall for the series.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was nothing between Gibbon and Silverton, as the sport's internationally renowned commentator Tim 'Caveman' Barrot marvelled that they posted an identical fastest qualifying time of 48.462s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That is unheard of, and I've called this sport for a number of years," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To have the top two qualifiers in the Top 9 with the exact same time."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In Group B, Whanganui's Hayden Wilson had the catbird seat coming into Shelterview with an eight point series lead, only to lose the lot when his engine grille fell off during the Top 9 eliminator.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Struggling on, the loss of power meant Wilson finished with a slow 56.942s time, leaving him to finish eighth overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The only saving grace was Waikato's Karl Beaver, sixth overall before Shelterview, won the round in 52.544s, ahead of new series leader Tim Edhouse (53.047s), with Beaver denying the Owhango driver a crucial extra point.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It stripped the threads out the back of the grille," Wilson said, adding he kept on driving because he hoped it was just a reverse bucket.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It just means the championship's jammed up a little bit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were all pretty close to start with [on qualifying times].</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I knew we couldn't bugger around, there were plenty behind us."</p>
