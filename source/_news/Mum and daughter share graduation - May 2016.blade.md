<p>IN THE FAMILY: Andrea Thornton and daughter Hannah Ratcliffe (former WHS student) at their graduation. Both women graduated with Masters of Nursing degrees.</p>
<p>When Whanganui woman Andrea Thornton graduated recently, she had a very special person walking with her across the stage - her daughter, Hannah Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>The two women have graduated from Massey University with Master of Nursing degrees.</p>
<p>Mrs Thornton has worked for the Whanganui District Health Board as a cancer nurse co-ordinator for three years, and before that worked in primary care.</p>
<p>Ms Ratcliffe is based in Palmerston North, and has been a nurse for five years.</p>
<p>She worked at Christchurch Men's Prison for a year but moved back to the North Island following the 2011 Christchurch earthquake.</p>
<p>She now divides her time between the emergency department at Palmerston North Hospital and the health clinic at Linton Army Camp.</p>
<p>"Although we're both nurses, we have quite a different focus within nursing," said Mrs Thornton.</p>
<p>The pair come from a nursing family. Mrs Thornton's mother - now 82 and present at her daughter's and granddaughter's graduation - was a surgical nurse for many years.</p>
<p>Mrs Thornton's aunt was also a nurse, and her younger daughter is a veterinary nurse.</p>
<p>Mrs Thornton said she was delighted to be able to graduate with her daughter, although the pair had not planned to graduate together. "It was very special," she said.</p>
<p>Ms Ratcliffe, who went to Whanganui High School, said while she and her mother were never in the same classes during their studies, there were perks to studying the same degree.</p>
<p>"For example I had just done a pharmacology paper, and then she took it the semester afterwards, so just being able to discuss it was helpful."</p>
