<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Whanganui White Fern Jess Watkin speaks to&nbsp;Zaryd Wilson&nbsp;about about a cricketing journey which has taken her from the backyard to the international stage.</em></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The cricket scorecard at the Watkin household in the mid-2000s must have been boring reading.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin bowls to Watkin, over and over again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had the perfect backyard, so we had a little cricket pitch and stuff."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jess Watkin is home in Whanganui after a successful debut White Ferns tour which earned her a New Zealand Cricket contract and kick-started what could be a long international career.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's a goal she's had for a decade and one which others may have held for her for longer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mentor and Cricket Wanganui's Dilan Raj remembers first noticing Watkin playing at Springvale Park as a young child.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It wasn't so much in the way she struck the ball or bowled," Raj says. "Just the way she played. For me I think character is more important than talent and she had that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin would have been about 10 at the time, growing up around backyard cricket on an old tennis court at her family's Westmere property.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My brother's friends would come over and play and I'd always be like, 'Can I play, can I play?' and they were like, 'No, no'," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So I used to sit in the paddock next door and score for them, score their backyard games.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But I knew I could play it because I used to play with dad to the side. He'd give me throw-downs, so I knew I could do it. But my brother just wouldn't let me."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On the May and June Northern Hemisphere tour Watkin played six one-day internationals and three T20s, starring in the tour opener with 77 not out, the highest score by a White Fern on debut.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her 142-run partnership with captain Suzie Bates was a New Zealand record.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">It's pretty obvious now her brother, Kane, and his mates eventually did let her join in those backyard games.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"One time they finally let me bowl and I bowled one of them out so after that they were like, 'Nah, she can play'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My brother and I would be out playing all night, we used to get a spotlight out to play at night time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We used to have a trophy for backyard cricket between us and we used to play test matches."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kane was a handy cricketer who went on to represent Wanganui so the sibling rivalry was strong.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He used to pad me up and bowl bouncers at me and I used to get hit all the time. With a hard ball&hellip; I had to duck and everything," Watkin says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just loved it. I'd cry and he'd be like, 'Suck it up, get back out there'. So many times I used to go in crying but then I'd go back out.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I look back now and anything that comes at my head I can hit it. If anyone bowls me a bouncer it's one of the strong points of my game, I can pull it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Westmere backyard soon became Springvale Park.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin joined school teams - playing with boys because there weren't girls teams - and getting free coaching from Raj.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I never played girls cricket until I was at secondary school, so I had no idea, and even then I still played men's cricket."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Springvale Park became Victoria Park when she began playing premier men's club cricket as a young teenager.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">By now she had been identified by Central Districts, had made age group women's sides, and was working with Raj who does coaching for the association.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin was a fan too and would travel to White Ferns games when she could.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sophie Devine, now a team-mate in the national side, was her hero.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She was the first one I really looked up to."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Victoria Park soon became bigger venues like Lincoln in Christchurch when she was named in the Central Districts Hinds (senior women's team) as a 15-year-old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were all there and I was like 'Wow," These are the people I look up to and stuff and they all just in this room.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was just watching them play and I was like, 'Man, they're so good'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My very first season I got Sophie Devine out a couple I times. I was almost like her bunny type of thing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While her heroes are now peers she also shares a spot in the national side with others she's come through the grades with.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Players like Amelia Kerr and Hannah Rowe, who she played in an under 11 boys team with and who presented her with her White Ferns cap on debut.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was such a real cool moment because we'd grown up playing together and then we were in the Hinds together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin always wanted to make the White Ferns while at Whanganui High School but she just missed out. But not by much.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In December last year, Watkin smashed a double century as captain of the Central Districts under-21 side and White Ferns coach Haidee Tiffen got on the phone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She told me I was so close, I just had to make an improvement."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin needed to work on her fitness so she got "stuck in" working with personal trainer Ebony Kerr.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I knew that I had to make a change and I always put it off but I got to the point where I just had to do it," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's bad but I always thought like, talent, it's always there and they'll pick me if I'm still performing. And I always worked on [fitness] but never as much as I did in the last six months.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Now I've got what I want."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Every professional athlete has a story about when they found out they had made a national side - a phone call in the supermarket, hearing it on the news.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was walking to the gym, I'd just been training with Dilan," Watkin says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was so crazy ... I was so speechless. I was like, 'Are you serious'?" [Tiffen] was like, 'This is one of my favourite phone calls I've had to make'."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That was just a fortnight before she turned 20 and a few weeks later she made her debut in that record-breaking T20 against Ireland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was so nervous but when I got out there and faced my first couple of balls I was fine."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">White Ferns coach Tiffen says more important than Watkin showing "huge talent at a young age" is that she performs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She performed at the age group level and with the Central Hinds. It's hard to notice those types of things.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She opened the bowling (against England) and that's no easy feat for a young player against the No 1-ranked team."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And what Raj picked up at Springvale Park a decade ago, Tiffen noticed on the White Ferns tour.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For people that watched the games, I think what they saw was she always had a smile on her face. You can see there's a young player who's enjoying it. She's fitting in really well."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Well enough to seal a White Ferns contract.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's a player that we want to invest in over the next 12 months and we want her to have the opportunity to spend some time training and focus on her cricket," Tiffen says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Women's cricket is going from strength to strength. We've got three world cups in the next two and a half years. That's exciting for a young players coming into the women's game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's really in her hands. I know that she's come back absolutely motivated and wants to improve her game."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin says it's an exciting time for women's cricket with more games being televised, professional leagues starting up and more money making it possible for more female players to earn a living.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year some White Ferns matches will be held as double-headers alongside Black Caps games.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lincoln might soon become Eden Park.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's pretty exciting. Having that home World Cup (in 2021) is also going to help us because it's going to grow the game a bit more.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We flew business class and stuff and things like that just make a huge difference. I thought we were hard done by, and we are compared to the men, but it's still a really cool experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's always room for improvement and it will. It's come such a long way."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin has spent some of her time back home speaking at high schools.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really want to grow the game here and get some girls playing because there's so many opportunities for them," she says.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">"People think coming from Whanganui, it's like you can't go anywhere like that, but I've reached the top and I'm from Whanganui and I've done it all myself and with Dilan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just want to show girls there is an opportunity for them to be able to play for New Zealand out of Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And for now, she plans to stay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've got everything that I want here. I've got Dilan and I've got access to the cricket facility at Collegiate.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Family's always important to me and I've got them here. It doesn't mean I'm going to stay here for the rest of my life but I'm happy here at the moment."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Raj looks back to that moment at Springvale Park when he "realised there was something special" and can see how she's got to this point.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If she got beaten by a ball there weren't any tears. She just carried on. You really only had to show or tell her things once."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But young talent never guarantees success, Raj says, and it's taken "a lot of hard work and a lot of tears along the way".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At that age you just don't know. What you do see is someone who could succeed to whatever level that is."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin knows what level she wants to get to.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I spend my whole summer just travelling around and playing cricket and now it's my job. I get paid to just play cricket, pretty much, so it's a dream come true really.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I want to eventually be one of the best cricketers in the world."</p>
