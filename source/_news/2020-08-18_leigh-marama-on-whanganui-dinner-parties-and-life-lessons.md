Every Monday, the Chronicle fires 10 questions at a Whanganui local. This week Mike Tweed talks to Ngā Tāngata Tiaki o Whanganui's new communications manager, Leigh-Marama McLachlan.

**Leigh-Marama** is the former Māori News correspondent at RNZ and returned to her hometown of Whanganui with her whānau in 2018.

**_You're hosting a dinner party and can invite any three people from history to attend. Who would they be, and why?_**

You probably mean famous people but, to be honest, I'd rather invite my brother and sister who passed away.

I never got to know them and I would just love the chance to spend time and laugh with them. I also recently learned of my tūpuna, Haimona Te Utupoto, who was a tohunga for moko kauae, and I'd love to cook him tea.

**_What is one piece of advice you would give your 20-year-old self?_**

Get your OE out of the way before you have babies.

**_What is your favourite thing to do in Whanganui?_**

My favourite thing to do in Whanganui is hang out with my family at my parents' place, always.

**_How do you think Whanganui has changed over the years?_**

Whanganui is a really beautiful place. The walkway along the awa has been a great addition here. It's also nice to see fewer empty shops up the (Victoria) Ave.

**_If you had to live in another country, where would it be and why?_**

I wouldn't want to live anywhere else right now with Covid-19 hammering other countries but, if that wasn't the case, perhaps Tahiti. It looks beautiful there and we have stories about our tūpuna having links to Rangiātea in Tahiti.

**_Who, outside of your family, would you say is your greatest inspiration?_**

I can't think of anyone in particular outside my whānau. I'm inspired by other Māori women who are working hard and raising babies.

**_Would you rather sing along to every song you heard, or dance to every song you heard?_**

Definitely sing.

**_One album is stuck on repeat in your office, which would you choose?_**

I don't listen to albums, I'm so inept when it comes to music. Something R&B most likely.

**_What is one aspect of Whanganui that you think could be improved?_**

It would be great to have a few more restaurants and bars – a better nightlife.

**_Which event from history would you have most liked to attend?_**

The signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.
