<h3><span>'THE REMNANT' WON this year's regional Smokefreerockquest final at the Opera House on Saturday night.</span></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/tUX-amW3rdk">Watch the WHS entries</a></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>It was a big night out for Whanganui High School (WHS) at the regional Smokefreerockquest final with the school sweeping all the but two placings and awards.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>There was no stage fright for The Remnant, who took to the band category at the Opera House, to lead a clean sweep for WHS in what was their first time performing live.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Guitarist and vocalist Wiremu Rogan said the win came as a shock to him and band members TokarƒÅrangi Poa, Cypress Kani-Hurinui, Josh Waitai and Chester Nevil.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was our first time playing live and we were really outside of our comfort zones playing in front of a big crowd like that," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had practised lots, we were really committed and we all played as a team - our vocals and harmonies were really good.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The audience was really supporting us and gave us lots of energy to play our best."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rangitikei College duo Corby and Tia (Tia Wright and Te Kopiona Ratana) won the solo/duo section with Whanganui High School's Maia (Maia Falkner) in second place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Runner-up in the band category was Whanganui High School's prog rock band Pantheon (Dan Goodwin, Kahu Miller, Daniel Hubers and Sebastian Alcayaga) with White Guys and Caleb completing and all-WHS podium.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Smokefreerockquest founder and director Glenn Common, who was in Whanganui for the regional final, said more bands than ever were reaching the standard required from national finalists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This means that real dedication is required to achieve the stand-out quality that the judges will be looking for," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They have to capture 15 minutes of their original material on video for selection as national finalists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a process that demands creativity and musical ability, being able to work together as a group and having good organisational skills. What separates them out is perseverance &ndash; industry success seldom happens overnight."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The four acts win musical gear from NZ Rockshop and join each other in the opportunity to gain selection for the national final in September.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The top regional bands and solo/duos submit footage for selection as finalists to play off at the Smokefreerockquest national final on Saturday September 22 at the Dorothy Winstone Centre in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Remnant also won the Tangata Beats Award and go into the selection process for the national finals of that event.</strong></p>
