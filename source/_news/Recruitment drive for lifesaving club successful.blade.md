<p>Wanganui Surf Lifeguard members Shannon Schimanski, Mia Gemmel, <strong>Kaya Dobbie (WHS) and Alex Forlong (WHS)</strong> with some of the new gear donated by Whanganui businesses.</p>
<p>A list of about a dozen potential recruits was the result of a successful Wanganui Surf Lifeguard Service open day on Sunday.</p>
<p>With the new season only three months away the service was keen to sign up new lifeguards as well as show off some of the new equipment which has been donated or sponsored by local businesses.</p>
<p>"We had a slow trickle through the morning," Wanganui Surf Lifeguard Service promotions officer Melanie Miller said.</p>
<p>The open day was held at service's Castlecliff Beach clubrooms.</p>
<p>"We've got about a dozen names who are interested in coming along to training so that's a good start," Mrs Miller said.</p>
<p>"We're particularly excited that two of the waka ama leaders are two that are on the list and they're quite interested in getting some of their younger members involved."</p>
<p>Pool training starts next Sunday with patrols at Castlecliff and Mowhanau beaches to begin sometime in December.</p>
<p>"We achieved what we set out to achieve which was to get people interested. There's a few that are just interested in getting involved with the club and helping out."</p>
