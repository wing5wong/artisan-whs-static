The team finished 16th out of 32 teams in A Grade. 🏐💚💛

Day 4

Boys football semi final yesterday morning vs Onslow College. Boys drew 0-0 at full time, but lost 4-3 on penalties, so close to making the final. Great effort though.

They then went on to win 3-0 win vs Trident High School in the third place playoff to secure a bronze medal. Very good effort taking a medal home. Caps off a solid tournament. Well done team! 💚💛🙌⚽️
