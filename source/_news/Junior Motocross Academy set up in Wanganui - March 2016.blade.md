<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The Wanganui Motocross Club has over 40 junior motocross and mini riders (aged five to 10). To encourage them to take the sport to the highest level possible, the Club has set up a Junior Motocross Academy. They were able to sell naming rights so the Academy is now called 'Balance Chartered Accountants Wanganui Junior Motocross Academy.' $5,000 has been raised, which will go to training camps and bus trips to motocross events.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">It was the brainchild of Antony Rountree, who was introduced to motocross riding when he was a youngster. Back then there were only a handful of juniors but the sport has become more popular. Two of Antony's sons are keen motocross riders and Antony says the sport is very much a family thing.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The first training event is a two day training camp at the club in the school holidays. The Nationals are at the end of April and Antony believes that they have two or three riders who will be there to compete. The Academy's objective is to improve riding skills to the point that more will be able to go. As a group they will all be going to the North Island championships in the middle of the year to compete or observe.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Training is from 4pm to 7.30pm on Wednesday nights and at 11am on Saturdays, at the club site close to the airport. Non-members are welcome. </span></span></p>
