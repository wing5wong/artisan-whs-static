Peter Scott will be a justifiably proud man when the motorcycles roar on the Cemetery Circuit on Boxing Day.

Peter will be in attendance as usual, but the meeting this year is special for him. Peter's son, Craig, and grandson, Alex, will be racing against each other.

All three have had a close association with the circuit with Peter and Craig life-members of the Wanganui Motorcycle Club.

Peter has missed only one Boxing Day meeting and that was in 1953. He had his first ride on the circuit in 1955 and his last in 1986. Peter said Craig had been going to the circuit since he could walk and so had Alex.

Craig, for his part, sets up the circuit before riding on it. He and Alex will be competing in the Motards class, which has close competition. In being in charge of setting up the circuit, Craig will have a long Christmas Day.

A day later he and Alex will race against each other for the third time, having earlier ridden at Taupo and Manfeild and having agreed to do the series together.

Craig reported that Alex was "going all right."
