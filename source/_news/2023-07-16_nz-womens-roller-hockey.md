Major auction to support our three NZ women's roller hockey reps

Whanganui has three representatives in the New Zealand women’s roller hockey team contesting the [](<>)Asian regional qualification tournament in China in October.

Jemma Bates, with 25 years playing experience under her belt, will co-captain the team, while 15-year-old Whanganui High School students Siobhan Pitkethley and Michaela Ross are also in the squad.

And if you think 15 is a little young to be contesting an open-age international event, well Jemma was a senior New Zealand player at just 14 years.

Having lived out of the country, Jemma returned to Whanganui a couple of years ago and was straight back into roller hockey.

“It’s fast and it’s fun and you need to be fit, so we are working hard on cardio and strengthening exercises,” says Jemma.

And you also need to be tough — “Yes, you get bumps and bruised up from falls … and you get hit by the ball!”

A major fundraising effort for the threesome is a major auction this Sunday, July 2, at the Vintage Car Club rooms in Patapu Street, Whanganui East.

Viewing is at 11.30am and the auction runs from 2pm to 4pm with a huge array on offer — sports equipment, a rowing machine, a Total Gym, artwork, jewellery, clothing, furniture and more.
