Once again WHS athletes put in superb performances on the big stage as the 2020/2021 season wound down with the North Island secondary schools’ athletics. Competing as part of the Whanganui regional team WHS athletes were to the fore.

Right at the top of the list of Whanganui performers was **Maggie Jones** who had a great weekend easily winning the 100mtrs Hurdles and 300mtrs hurdles and in the process setting a new school record and the fastest time in N.Z this year of 43.70sec. for the 300mtrs. She also anchored the 4x100 and 4x400 teams both of which claimed bronze in their events.

**Casie Glentworth** had her best ever hurdles performance claiming silver in the 300mtrs and a big personal best of 46.45, while **Charlotte Baker** took the bronze also in a personal best of 47.41 to give WHS an amazing 1,2,3 finish at the North Islands and again demonstrating our dominance in hurdle events.

Along with **Paris Munro** who had a great weekend with a season’s best in the Triple jump and a 5th in the 100mtrs Hurdles the WHS 4x100mtrs team running for Whanganui finished 3rd heading off strong regional teams from Auckland and Wellington to get under 50sec for the first time ever for a new school record of 49.85.

**Flynn Johnston** ran strongly in the senior boys 400mtrs for 7th and then had his best run yet over 300mtrs Hurdles to take 2nd in a new personal best of 39.77 sec., he finished the weekend leading out the Whanganui 4x400mtrs team to 4th. 

**Nat Kirk** had a top run for 2nd in the 110mtrs Hurdles and backed this up with a courageous display in the 300mtrs, after falling at the 6th hurdle but still getting up to run 4th, and then anchored the 4x400mtrs with a great final leg to bring the team up from 7th to a 4th place finish.     

**Charlotte, Casie and Maggie** were also a big part of the Whanganui 4x400mtrs team that took 3rd in a great time of 4min.05.

**Cody Campbell** in his first big competition threw brilliantly in the junior boys Javelin to take third in a PB of 33.21mtrs and showcase his considerable talent. He also backed this up with a 9th in the Shot and 12th in the Discus.

**Carrie Rennie** jumped a new personal best for 7th in the Long Jump of 4.60 and then anchored the Whanganui 4x400mtrs team to a 5th place finish.

**Teresa Rennie** was 7th in the final of the 80mtrs hurdles with a PB of 12.93, was 5th in the 300mtrs Hurdles and lead off runner for the 4x400mtrs who finished 5th.

**Mason Pye** in his first major meet also came away with some great results taking away both the Para Junior 100mtrs and Long Jump. 

All other members of the team competed with distinction and the whole team had great experiences and strong competition which will hold them in good stead when the new season starts in October and heading into the biggest competition of the year the N.Z schools the first weekend of December. 

**A huge thank you to Greg Fromont and Elaine Baker for your continued coaching and support you give our athletes.**
