<p><br />Optometry is a lot more interesting than you would imagine, according to a Whanganui optometrist who is in her first year on the job.</p>
<p>After completing five years of study at the University of Auckland, Olivia Wood-Bodley joined Wanganui Eyecare in February and also works at the company's clinics at Eyes on Victoria and Hawera Eyecare.</p>
<p>Wood-Bodley was born and raised in Whanganui and attended Carlton, Whanganui Intermediate and <strong>Whanganui High school.</strong></p>
<p>"I always knew I was going to work in health somewhere," Wood-Bodley said.</p>
<p>"I did a general first year in Auckland and discovered optometry when I couldn't see the screens in the lecture theatre."</p>
<p>A visit to an optometrist sparked her interest in the field and she graduated with a Bachelor of Optometry (Hons).</p>
<p>"It's a lot more interesting than you could ever imagine it being," she said.</p>
<p>"People think optometry is just glasses but we can prescribe medication, there are eye diseases and lots of interesting things going on with eyes."</p>
<p>Wood-Bodley is interested in learning more about contact lenses, including cosmetic and specialist lenses as well as the usual soft lenses.</p>
<p>She says she is pleased to be back in Whanganui and near family and friends here and in Wellington.<em><strong></strong></em></p>
<p>"I really enjoy being back. Everyone in Whanganui is super supportive and the patients are really lovely. It's good to give back to the place that raised me."</p>
