<p><span>WORK TO DO: Wanganui high school's Jake Hooper tries to find a way through the defence in Wanganui U18 vs Wellington U18 A at Gonville Domain on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>Four games in 24 hours by their leading players caught up with Wanganui under-18s at their Central Hockey tournament at Gonville Domain over the weekend.</p>
<p>As well as meeting two Wellington U18 teams and the Horowhenua U18 side, at least four members of the squad also turned out for their Tech College Old Boys club at midday on Saturday before the tournament started.</p>
<p>One of them, Joseph Redpath, scored from a penalty corner to give Wanganui a 1-0 lead with Wellington Development, before conceding two field goals before half-time and then a third for a 3-1 loss.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Wanganui traded the lead with Wellington A all game, before losing 4-3.</p>
<p>Rangitikei's Jordan Calkin scored two field goals while Wanganui High School's Ronan Spence got a penalty corner, but Wellington scored twice within five minutes to hit the front with nine minutes left.</p>
<p>That game had taken it out of Wanganui by the time they met Horowhenua at 5.30pm, who did not let up with an 11-0 hammering under lights.</p>
<p>"They ran out of puff, they had nothing left," said Wanganui coach Matt Belk.</p>
<p>"Really, they should only play a maximum of three games."</p>
<p>He singled out Calkin and WHS's Tom Adkins for big efforts.</p>
<p>Another team to rise to the occasion was the St Anthony's School team.</p>
<p>Giving Wellington Development an extra game to make up the numbers on Sunday, the youngsters played above themselves in a 2-0 loss.</p>
