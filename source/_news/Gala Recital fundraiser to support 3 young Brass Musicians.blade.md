<p>Brass Whanganui are performing a fundraising Gala Recital in the Sarjeant Gallery on Saturday, August 25 to support three young brass musicians, who have been selected for the National Youth Band of NZ to tour Australia. They have to fundraise over $2000 each to participate in the tour.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The three musicians are cornet player Sarah Wright, currently in year 13 at Whanganui High School and two Mercer brothers - Jacob (t<span class="text_exposed_show">enor horn) who is in the New Zealand Army Band in Christchurch and Ethan, (Euphonium) who is also in Year 13 at High School.<br /></span></h4>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Ethan says, &ldquo;My older brothers led the way with both of them being part of Brass Wanganui. I&rsquo;ve tried a few brass instruments but have settled on the euphonium and I love it.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">He practices a couple of hours a day either at school (&ldquo;the school is pretty supportive&rdquo;) or at home. &ldquo;I used to play football,&rdquo; he says &ldquo;but I have to keep up with my music practice.&rdquo; He has been a member of the Brass Wanganui senior band for about four years and was there when they won best B grade band at the recent Brass Band National Championships in Blenheim recently. &ldquo;It was an exciting day,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;We are slowly coming back up.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This is the first year he has been selected for the National Youth Brass Band and is looking forward to visiting Brisbane and Toowoomba in Queensland for 10 days with the band in January 2019. Ethan is also in the National Secondary Schools Brass Band and will be going to a &lsquo;Band Camp&rsquo; in Christchurch in early October.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>Tickets cost $50 for the two hour Gala recital, which Ethan says &ldquo;will be a fun event.&rdquo; It will be a formal black tie event with plenty of food and wine. Tickets are available from the Sarjeant Gallery or Brass Whanganui. Otherwise contact Bruce Jellyman on 0275404159.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Ethan thanks those who have supported him including David Maas his tutor, Brass Wanganui and Lyn Wickham from Bayley&rsquo;s Real Estate.</span></p>
