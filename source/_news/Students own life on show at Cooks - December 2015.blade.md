<p>ARTISTS: WHS students' Stephanie Lockwood (right) and Daisy Wilkie are exhibiting their art at Cooks Gallery.</p>
<p><em>Stephanie through her ages</em>&nbsp;is the title of a new art exhibition at Cooks Gallery.</p>
<p>Stephanie Lockwood has filled most of the gallery with works that cover her artistic life, from the simple forms of her early years to the more mature art of where she is now.</p>
<p>Assisting her in the role of supporting artist is friend and fellow Wanganui High School student Daisy Wilkie; her work fills the rest of the gallery space.</p>
<p>Both girls are also members of Rei Hendry's Art House.</p>
<p>"Ropiha Paul Bevan offers a scholarship every year to a young artist and the Arts Society nominates somebody," says Stephanie. "I got nominated this year and he offered me the scholarship. " The scholarship pays for Stephanie's exhibition, which is on at Cooks Gallery until the end of January.</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful exhibition," says Judy Webby of the Arts Society ... "It just shows you the level a student like Stephanie can get to, when you look at that folio over there and look at the refinement she has reached through her stages of development."</p>
<p>"I started with Rei when I was seven and I'm 17 now," says Stephanie. "I haven't stopped going to Art House. Rei is so inspiring."</p>
<p>Art is a huge part of Stephanie's life - so much so she paints for relaxation - but her academic interests lie in the sciences. Her mother Maxine is a great source of encouragement and together they take advantage of many an artistic opportunity, including glass art at Chronicle Glass.</p>
<p>The day she finished her school exams, Stephanie sat down and painted another five pieces for the exhibition - all birds: a kingfisher, fantail, waxeye, a rainbow lorikeet and a morepork. "I love painting birds; I love the feel of them, how their feathers all have different textures...<span style="line-height: 1.5;">and their eyes. They all have different eyes."</span></p>
<p>One of her tui - with kowhai flowers - is painted on a pillow slip. An unusual feature is a painting of a tiger wearing a christening gown. The exhibition is an eclectic mix, especially when the work of Daisy Wilkie is included.</p>
<p>"I've been going to the Art House since I was 12," says Daisy, "and then I did NCEA Level 1 Art. I've been more of a surreal, cartoon kind of artist, while Stephanie is more realistic." She says she felt very privileged when Stephanie asked her to be supporting artist. Daisy is a year ahead, having just finished Year 13.</p>
<p><em>Stephanie through her ages</em>&nbsp;is open throughout December and January on Saturdays from 10am-3pm, Sundays 1-3pm, Mondays and Tuesdays 10am-midday. There is also an Art Society exhibition in the Cooks Gallery back studio.</p>
<p>Cooks Gallery is off Ridgway St between Wanganui Motors and Holdaways in Trafalgar Place.</p>
