And they’ve done it again! 

Huge congratulations to our German international students David Strobel and Milo Weber on winning GOLD  in the Novice Double Sculls at the New Zealand Club Rowing Championships! 

To claim another national title is an outstanding achievement.  We are so 

 incredibly proud of David and Milo and their accomplishments  in such a short time. 

What a moment. What a result.
