<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The issue and potential spread of the zika virus affected country delegations differently. Those who have the virus spoke of their exposure and difficulties containing it, whereas other countries were prepared to offer research and funding for its control. Some delegates raised the possibility of closing borders but it was pointed out that this would impact negatively on trade reducing the financial resources to fight the virus. The other topic to be discussed in the afternoon was the plight of refugees. </span></span></p>
