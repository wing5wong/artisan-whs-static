Lucy and Bryn Morgan - National Secondary Schools’ Brass Band

Whanganui has a reputation as an arts destination and to maintain that fame, it requires our youth to be finding their creative best. In the world of music, Lucy and Bryn Morgan are two examples of youth who have found their groove: playing in the Whanganui Brass band and representing Whanganui High School in the National Secondary Schools’ Brass Band to hone their craft. 

Bryn is in his fourth year in the band, and for Lucy, this is her first year. To gain a place in the band, they individually went through a rigorous audition process.

The National Secondary Schools’ Brass Band ‘camp’ is taking place in Wellington this year. They’ll gather, have workshops, share ideas, and then perform for the public on 4 October at Scots College, Wellington, in a concert titled Tū Māia. 

Bryn explains, “It’s always interesting to go. You get to know the Brass people throughout the country well, with about 25 musicians from around the country performing in the main band.”

Lucy started playing for Brass Whanganui about six years ago, saying,

“My brothers were playing for Brass Whanganui, and I thought I’d like to give it a go. I pulled the drum kit from the basement and started. You have to play a bit of everything with percussion, a bit of timpani, drum kit, xylophone and glockenspiel. Lots of hitting instruments basically.”

Everyone in the family plays the piano. Mum Mo, coincidently, is a piano teacher. Callum, their younger brother is also in Brass Whanganui. Lucy quips, “It’s very loud at our house.”

Bryn, now 17, started playing trombone at about eight years old. “Bruce Jellyman came to our school and got a bunch of us in the staffroom and taught us, and some of us stuck with it. Brass Whanganui, well, that’s why we’re here; they do such a lot.”

“I don’t know for certain, but I’m pretty sure we’re the youngest senior A Grade band in the country.”

Bruce Jellyman, band director for the Brass Whanganui, says, “They are highly talented across the musical spectrum, and they’ll be taking key roles in the National Secondary Schools’ Brass Band. What we’re asking them to do at Whanganui Brass senior band level is pretty out there; we ask a lot. This is a joyful moment for a musical director, seeing everything come to fruition for them; it’s why you do it, really.”

Lucy, who is about to turn 16 in a couple of weeks, is always on the lookout for new opportunities to play. This is Bryn’s last year at school, and he intends to focus more on rowing, another passion, and a sport that Whanganui is well known for.

The music department at Whanganui High School is thriving with about 500 students learning music every year. Jeanette Jones, Head of Music, loves her job, even after 17 years. She says, “I work with some stunning students, and there are those that come here without any musical aspiration, and then they discover ‘oh, I can play the guitar.’ The music department is a bit of a sanctuary, too.” 

All hail to Lucy and Bryn’s creative talent, and all youth involved in music; their playing keeps Whanganui’s strong musical heritage alive and thriving.
