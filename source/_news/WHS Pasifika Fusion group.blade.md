<p>The Pasifika Fusion Festival is an annual event which allows Pasifika youth an opportunity to excel and to freely express themselves through a variety of art forms, (such as cinematography, cultural dance, debate, drama, essay &amp; poetry writings, quiz, speech-making, science, talent, visual &amp; wearable arts), while embracing cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The Pasifika Fusion Festival began on the 4 July 2018 with the WHS Pasifika Quiz team (consisting of Jasmine Beard, Elyana Gifford, Keilani Tyrell, AJ Malili-Malo-Lauano and Messina Sua) travelling over to Palmerston North to compete against 15 other teams. It was an action filled, exciting experience for our team who were doing well in the early rounds but didn&rsquo;t quite manage to make it to the top three by the end. Motivation is high however, and we have promised to come back fitter, faster and ready to excel in 2019!!</p>
<p>The group met bright and early the next day and set off for Palmerston North at 6:45 arriving by 8:00, for registration. Once we secured our spot in the main stage area our students were required to meet at the rehearsal room, ready to perform their individual and group talents.&nbsp; We had students representing our school in the following categories; vocal group and solo performances, dance group and solo performances and wearable arts.</p>
<p>Later that day, our full group which consisted of 36 students and 5 drummers (all ex-WHS and Pasifika students) performed in our Group Cultural Performance. This year we included songs and dances from all around the Pacific with items coming from the islands of Tahiti, Samoa, Fiji and Hawaii. Another significant change was that this year many our songs were performed vocally, without the support of a back-up track and only used the beats from our five drummers. Originally this change was a struggle, but the many hours of practise and determination eventually paid off as we performed on stage with the volume we were hoping for and to an excellent level.</p>
<p>We then got to watch other groups perform throughout the day and were amazed at the level of competition and impressed at the creativity demonstrated by other Pasifika Groups at festival. That evening all groups were invited to perform short segments again during the awards ceremony. Unfortunately, we were unable to gain any placings this year but walked away proud and pleased with our positive participation, performance and the experience of competing with other Pasifika students.</p>
<p>Finally, a quote from one of our senior students,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;...none of this would have been possible without our amazing tutors and support staff who have guided and encouraged us. We are all forever grateful for your hard work and dedication that you put in every year. Although we did not place at the Pasifika Fusion Festival in Palmerston North, I think I speak on behalf of the group when I say that the experience I have had with my Pasifika whanau and the amazing new friends that I have met along the way reminded me as to why I joined in the first place. 2018 has truly been, another successful year for Pasifika.&rdquo; (Kaya Dobbie, Year 13)</p>
