<p><span>TEAM WORK: Wanganui High School's adventure racers (from left) Saskia Knight, Sarya Niutao, Levi Carroll, Lauryn Jeans, Kate Belsham (in boat), Connor Munro, Jimi Blinkhorne and Travis Bayler will be problem-solving on Great Barrier Island this weekend in the Get 2 Go national finals.</span></p>
<p>Eight Wanganui High School students will be getting their heads together at the weekend to nut out how to win the Get 2 Go Adventure Racing national final on Great Barrier Island.</p>
<p>This season's Hillary Outdoor event will be WHS' fifth attempt at the national finals after qualifying with a win in the regional tournament earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Adventure racing is about team work, both mental and physical agility, problem-solving to find solutions to best complete a wide variety of tasks, including orienteering, water sports and fitting puzzles together.</p>
<p>WHS outdoor pursuits teacher Josh Barnett said the team of Year 9 and 10 students had been in training for several months now preparing to better the school's previous performances.</p>
<p>"Last year we finished seventh, but there are 12 teams and for many of the larger metropolitan schools adventure racing is what they do best - it's their sport just like rugby or netball may be for others," Barnett said.</p>
<p>The group, Connor Munro, Kate Belsham, Lauryn Jeans, Levi Carrol, Travis Bayler, Jimi Blinkhorne, Sarya Niutao and Saskia Knight, had fundraised and sought out sponsorship from Whanganui businesses Nu Image Hair, Ali Arc, Sharp As transport and the St Johns Club to help pay for the trip.</p>
<p>"It's all about team work, problem-solving and putting puzzles together. Adventure racing involves a fair bit of physical challenge and water sports over the four days."</p>
