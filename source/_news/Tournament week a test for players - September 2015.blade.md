<p>Wanganui High School had 10 teams away for Secondary School Tournament Week throughout New Zealand. The teams played some great games and enjoyed the experience of being at a week long&nbsp;tournament. WHS would also like to say a big thank you to all the staff and parent coaches and managers that go away with our teams. Without your support this would not be possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Girls Football played in New Plymouth and finished&nbsp;15th overall. Played 8 games with 4 wins and 4 losses.</p>
<p>Phillips Electrical&nbsp;A1 Netball were in Palmerston Nth finishing&nbsp;10th in A Grade out of 32 teams, top Wanganui team at the&nbsp;tournament.&nbsp;They had some hard games throughout the week but never gave up and played very nice netball to finish their season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Girls Hockey were in Tauranga and finished 14th place in the Tier 2 Marie Fry Competition. They had some big games in wet conditions. A huge week for the girls after a big season!</p>
<p>Boys Senior Basketball were in Palmerston Nth and were out to make nationals this year. Unfortunately they lost a vital game during the week which kept them from placing in the top 6. The boys played some great basketball and finished the week coming 10th.</p>
<p>Boys Junior Basketball were also in Palmerston Nth, where they came up against some tough schools in their tournament. The boys learnt a&nbsp;lot from the week and enjoyed the experience coming 11th overall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boys Hockey were in Hamilton and&nbsp;ended up 4th overall. They have come off a huge season finishing runners up in the Division 1 Secondary School competition in Manawatu. They had some great games throughout the week nearly winning their semi final, but went down&nbsp;to a golden goal in almost 10 minutes of over time. They have a had a&nbsp;brilliant&nbsp;season.</p>
<p>Boys Football went to Christchurch and finished with a win against Timaru Boys High 4-1 placing 9th overall. The boys had some outstanding games throughout the week and grew as a team the more they played.</p>
<p>Boys Badminton traveled to North Harbour and&nbsp;had a huge&nbsp;week with lots of games. They played some great badminton and developed throughout the week.</p>
<p>U15 Rugby played in Wellington and finished up 10th overall. They played in the plate final for 9th-10th against St Bernards but unfortunately did not win. Overall the boys enjoyed the tournament playing some outstanding rugby.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1st XV Rugby went to Hawkes Bay for the Central 6 tournament and with comfortable wins over 3 days bought the trophy home. This was a great way to finish their successful season coming runners up in the Manawatu Colts grade.</p>
