<p class="element element-paragraph">Dance teacher Sharyn Underwood says her school's&nbsp;<em>We Are Family</em>&nbsp;production at the Royal Wanganui Opera House this weekend is sure to put a smile on everyone's face.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>We Are Family</em>&nbsp;is a fun show suitable for all ages and the 5pm start time means all family members can attend and enjoy it together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The cast of 100 includes students ranging from introductory to level three advanced performers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The main adult characters are played by Joana Simmons as Mother, <strong>Colin Hedivan&nbsp;</strong> <span>(WHS teacher)&nbsp;</span>as Father and Debbie Spence as Grandma.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Some people think I only teach little ones but this show demonstrates that my students represent a wide range of ages and abilities," Mrs Underwood said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The synopsis for the show demonstrates life's ups and downs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People come and go, things change, and not always for the best.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But if you work hard, and stick with your family, no matter what, things will be okay."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Families come in all shapes and sizes, she says, and some people we consider whanau are not even related to us.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But what's important is we love each other, we try to understand each other, and we aren't afraid to laugh at each other."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Young dancers had a laugh at their stage "Mum" Joana Simmons when they saw her in her wig and frock at dress rehearsal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The cast members say there have been a lot of laughs and only minor injuries during rehearsals for the show.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>We are Family</em>&nbsp;has a soundtrack of 26 songs including&nbsp;<em>Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Kung Fu Fighting</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>We are Family. Royal Wanganui Opera House, Saturday, April 7 and Sunday, April 8 at 5pm. Adults $18, Seniors and Students $15.</strong></p>
