<p><br />A group of eight people, some of whom hadn't been on a bike for decades, have unexpectedly become staunch cheerleaders for Whanganui's shared pathways.</p>
<p>They're participants in Cycle Forward, a national pilot programme for people with arthritis being trialled in Whanganui.</p>
<p>It was launched this year by Arthritis New Zealand and Whanganui District Council and the first six-week course began in mid-March. The programme has funding from ACC for three years.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">Let's Go Whanganui cycle skills co-ordinator Greg Fromont said for some of the people in the first group of eight, Cycle Forward had been life-changing. Another group of four</span>&nbsp;<span>had started the programme.</span></p>
<p>The programme begins with participants trying out stationary bikes and they progress to riding in a group on the shared pathways.</p>
<p>"At the start we asked them to do some simple tests - 30 seconds getting up and down from seated and a six minute walk," Fromont said.</p>
<p>"We tested them again [after six weeks] to see if the programme has helped them do more, like be able to walk to the dairy. We also recorded information such as 'have I been more active' ".</p>
<p>Fromont said that after only six weeks, the change in the group members' mobility and confidence has been amazing.</p>
<p>Group member Jill says before she joined the group, it had been 45 years since she had been on a bike.</p>
<p>"Now I've purchased an e-bike and I'm going out riding it on my own. Before this group, I would never have got on a bike again.</p>
<p>"I have people there who can help me if I need it. It's given us confidence to go into a bike shop and say 'this is what I need'.</p>
<p>"I used to do a lot of walking and I can't do that any more. Cycling has increased my balance. I joined the group because I didn't want to lose any more mobility."</p>
<p>Colleen bought a bike a couple of years ago but lacked the confidence to ride it.</p>
<p>"This group has pushed me along to cycle a bit further and do a bit more. It has really helped my walking."</p>

<p><br />Ann, known in the group as "the wonder one", has chronic fatigue and autoimmune issues as well as arthritis. She had an e-bike but was too scared to go out on it.</p>
<p>"It's good to have someone encourage you. They have helped me getting my confidence. I was so terrified of falling off. They're happy to work at your level.</p>
<p>"My stamina has increased. I'm more steady on my feet now. I hope the group will continue to meet on a regular basis."</p>

<p><br />Joan has always ridden a bike but in recent times her enthusiasm had dwindled.</p>
<p>"I'd think it was too windy. This has encouraged me to go out, windy or not.</p>
<p>"The instructors have been marvellous, encouraging us."</p>
<p>The others agree that the instructors "have been gold" and they wished the course was longer than six weeks.</p>
<p>They are also grateful they can cycle off-road on the shared pathways.</p>
<p>"The cycleways are wonderful," Ann said.</p>
<p>"We don't have the confidence to ride on the road. I want to thank the council for doing this and hope they will continue with more. To people with health problems, it's the best thing for them."</p>
<p>The group is also conscious that riding a bike, rather than driving a vehicle, is good for the environment and cost efficient.</p>
<p>They intend to keep riding together as a group following completion of the course.</p>
<p>The Cycle Forward programme instructors are part-timers who are engaged through the Let's Go Whanganui contract awarded to the Whanganui Multisport Club to deliver cycle skills programmes.</p>
<p>Thousands of local students have done cycle skills training through Let's Go Whanganui.</p>
<p>Fromont said the contract was providing opportunities for the club's members to learn new skills such as managing events and teaching groups of people.</p>
