<p><strong>On Friday 26&nbsp;of May, WHS took 11 students to the lower north island Tough Guy/Gal competition held just out of Wellington.</strong></p>
<p>There was a 6 km and 12 km course. Our students did the 12 km course. It was a tough course, which the students completed 2 laps of running up hills, through rivers, muddy swamps, up cargo nets and under electric fences.</p>
<h3><strong>We finished 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> in the Male 12 km, and 1<sup>st</sup> 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> in the female race. Rebecca Baker won the open female race as a year 11, and her time earned her Level 3 credits with Excellence!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Travis Bayler defended his title winning the open men&rsquo;s for the second year in a row and is still only year 11. </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Also worth mentioning Connor Hoskin in Year 10, who finished 4<sup>th</sup> in the open mens achieved Level 3 Excellence credits as a year 10 student.</strong></p>
<p>We will be back next year to defend our title as the toughest school in the Lower North Island.&nbsp;</p>
