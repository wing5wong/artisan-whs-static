<p><strong>On Friday 25&nbsp;May 18 of the toughest Whanganui High School students went to the Tough Guy/Gal challenge held in Wellington.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We left at 6:45am on a cold dark wet morning and thought we were in for a long day. To our surprise when we got to Wainuiomata, it was mild temperatures and the sun was out.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The team completed 2 laps of a 6-km course, consisting of tunnels, mud pits, high walls, electric fences, big hills and rivers.<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
<h3>Travis Bayler &ndash; 1<sup>st</sup> overall<br />Rebecca Baker &ndash; 2<sup>nd</sup> = overall<br />Connor Hoskin &ndash; 2<sup>nd</sup> = overall<br />Connor Munro &ndash; 5<sup>th</sup> overall<br />Renee Teers &ndash; 4<sup>th</sup> &ndash; open womens</h3>
<h3><br />Because of our great results from all of our tough students we also WON OVERALL:&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>TOUGHEST SCHOOL - MENS<br />TOUGHEST SCHOOL - FEMALES<br /><br /></h3>
<p><strong>Well done team.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The hot showers at the finish where well deserved!</strong></p>
