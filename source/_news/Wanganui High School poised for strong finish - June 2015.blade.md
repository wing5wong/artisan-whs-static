<p>The Wanganui High School 1st XV is poised for a strong finish in the Manawatu Club Rugby Colts competition after winning its last away game for the season at the weekend.</p>
<p>WHS came from behind to beat College Old Boys at Onley Park in Palmerston North 22-13 after being down 13-7 at halftime.</p>
<p>The first try was scored by College Old Boys off the back of a pick-and-go 25 minutes into the first half. The conversion was successful to give the COB a 7-0 early lead.</p>
<p>WHS hit back within two minutes with Daniel Kauika setting up Corbin Warren with a switch play. Harerangi Meihana nailed the conversion to equal the score.</p>
<p>COB then received a penalty and successfully converted to snatch the lead back. Another penalty right out in front gave COB the 13-7 lead at the break.</p>
<p>WHS showed just how hungry for the ball they were and got it out to the backs where Kauika sliced through a gap to set Sheldon Pakinga up. The conversion was unsuccessful, but moved WHS to within one point of the home team.</p>
<p>WHS showed great determination and through hard, grinding work the forwards rumbled the ball up then got it out to the backline where they showed great hands through the line. Sheldon Pakinga finished off by scoring in the corner. The conversion was again unsuccessful, but gave WHS a 17-13 lead.</p>
<p>WHS kept grinding away and were rewarded with a try in the corner through Warren. The kick missed, but the 22-13 score gave WHS the well-deserved win.</p>
<p>WHS is in the top four of the competition and is ready to host a series of home games with teams down the ladder starting with Dannevirke on Saturday.</p>
<p>Wanganui Collegiate School is finding it difficult to win a trick this season and went down 43-11 in an away clash with Francis Douglas Memorial College in New Plymouth on Saturday. Many of WCS' top players from the past two seasons have left school leaving the 1st XV in a rebuilding mode.</p>
<p>In the Ashhurst Engineering Manawatu Secondary School competition the Cullinane College 1st XV pushed FAHS 2nds close losing by just two points. The final score, 43-41 to FAHS.</p>
