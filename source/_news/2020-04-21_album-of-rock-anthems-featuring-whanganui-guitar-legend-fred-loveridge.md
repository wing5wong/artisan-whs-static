**Can you imagine an album of iconic British Rock anthems played with orchestral style backing by a world class New Zealand guitarist?**

**Here it is - read on.**

Last year Kiwi record producer, Dick Le Fort (known as Richard Le Fort in the British music business), sold the idea of producing a recording of iconic British Rock Anthems to Lightfall, a subsidiary of Aardvark Records, who liked the idea and asked Dick to find a New Zealand guitarist to play the songs.

**After a widespread search, Dick secured the services of Whanganui guitar virtuoso, Fred Loveridge, to play these songs as guitar instrumentals.**

Anthem was recorded at Dicks recording studio, Music Production Company in Wellington during October and November 2019.

Dick Le Fort is a Whanganui product who started out with local radio station 2ZW. He then moved to Wellington to become House Producer at Broadcasting House Bowen Street, where he produced many hit records for the likes of Sharon O’Neil, the Warratahs and Brendan Dougan to name a few.

Dick already has a profile in the UK, established over the past 10 years producing records for many artists.

**Fred Loveridge is a brilliant guitarist who can play rock blues and jazz with great skill.** He has played in bands in Wellington and Whanganui including Captain Custard, Whisky Mama, Freddie and the Firebirds, Blues Buffet, Reset, Jazz Connection and River City Big Band. Captain Custard was formed by the late great Malcolm Hayman after the break-up of iconic Wellington band, the Quincy Conserve and included Malcolm, Fred and Dusty Loveridge (Fred’s brother) on bass guitar.

**Loveridge’s performances on this album are absolutely stunning, playing both electric and acoustic guitars. This artist is right up there with the best guitarist anywhere on the planet.**

Aardvark Records are one of the most successful companies marketing music via online digital platforms.

The tracks are Knights in White Satin - Moodie Blues / Justin Hayward, He Ain't Heavy He’s My Brother -The Hollies / Russell & Scott, Your Song - Elton John, Something - Beatles / George Harrison and Whiter Shade of Pale - Procol Harem / Brooker and Fisher. The arrangements are orchestral in style so no drums are used here.

**This really is a must for your collection. You can contact Fred on Facebook to purchase a CD. At $15, this is wonderful value, or buy online through I-tunes and other digital sites.**
