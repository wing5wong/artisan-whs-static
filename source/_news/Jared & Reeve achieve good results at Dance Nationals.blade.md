<p class="BasicParagraph"><strong>&ldquo;Whanganui's Junior Dancesport couple, Jared Sim (WHS student) and Reeve Watson, can be very proud of their results from this year&rsquo;s New Zealand Championships held in Hamilton over Labour weekend,&rdquo;</strong> says their Dancesport coach, Mark Glastonbury.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><strong>As Level 1 (1 dance) competitors they placed 5th, 5th and 6th by making all of their finals from a field of 14. They then placed a hugely impressive 5th in the next grade above, Level 2 Standard (2 dance) from a field of 16.</strong></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph">The organizers also include Open events (five dances) for each age group and style. This gives competitors a chance to rate themselves against all of New Zealand's Juniors, including the more experienced level 4/5 couples. <strong>Jared and Reeve advanced from the rounds, receiving 100% judging hits, through to the semi&rsquo;s in all three styles. They finally placed 10th in Standard and New Vogue and 11th in Latin.</strong></p>
