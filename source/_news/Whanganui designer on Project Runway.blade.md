<p class="element element-paragraph">Clothing designer Kerry Ranginui left his Whanganui hometown with nothing but a tank of gas and a car full of clothes hoping to make it in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I did have a place to stay but it was not an easy time," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ten years later, he is about to appear as a contestant on the first series of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>&nbsp;when it hits our TV screens early next month.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although he is unable to divulge details about the show at this stage, Ranginui says working alongside other designers is both inspirational and daunting.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You can't help but take sideways glances at what the others are doing and it does affect your attitude to your own work."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 33-year-old now works as a pattern maker with internationally renowned designer Karen Walker but his big break took a while.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I arrived in Auckland in 2008, the worldwide recession was at its peak and fashion outlets were closing down.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I couldn't get work in the industry so I did whatever I could and painted fences and cleaned swimming pools to make a living."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Things changed after he entered and won an online design competition and was offered work with Karen Walker.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A lot of people ask me if I get to see her at work and, yes I do.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I work in an office with her and we pattern makers are her hands you could say."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has now been on the team for eight years and worked on 30 Karen Walker collections.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui grew up in Castlecliff and attended Aranui Primary School, Rutherford Junior High and <strong>Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He says he had some fantastic teachers. One was the late Vanda Butters who was his home economics teacher at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She taught me so much and the last time I saw her, it was great to be able to share the news that I had won a national competition."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui worked at Jolt in Victoria Ave while studying at UCOL Whanganui and after graduation, spent his final pay on the petrol that got him to Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There were times when I wanted to give up and return home during that first couple of years but I'm happy to say my persistence paid off."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui says he is a long-time fan of the American&nbsp;<em>Project Runway</em>&nbsp;series and was proud to see the show's first New Zealand contestant, Sean Kelly from Hawera, win the 2014 season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He does come back to Whanganui for Christmas every year and always has enough petrol for the return trip these days.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The first episode of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>&nbsp;will screen on TVNZ 2 on October 1.</strong></p>
