<p><span>Well done to Y13 student Diana Taha Williams-Cribb who has successfully passed with flying colours her Zone Theory Umpires Exam getting 61 out of 62.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not only does Diana umpire every Saturday, she coaches our 9C team and plays netball. Diana also helped Netball Wanganui being a Junior coordinator for the future fern netball programme.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Diana has umpired many inter schools this year and gone away with Netball Wanganui Rep teams as their umpire, where at the U15 North Island nationals she was ranked top 8 in A grade and got the 5/6 play off game on finals day!</span></p>
<p><span>Well done Diana we wish you the best in your future of umpiring and look forward to seeing you grow in the role!</span></p>
<p><span>(Lisa Murphy, Sports Co-ordinator)</span></p>
