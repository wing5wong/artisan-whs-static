<p>Apprentices are an important part of the staff at Strong Electrical.</p>
<p>Co-owner Grant Neilson said of the 25 staff, five were apprentices, with a couple more who have just finished their apprenticeships.</p>
<p>"We try to take on one apprentice a year. It's really the only way for us to get good staff - to train them ourselves," Mr Neilson said.</p>
<p>"About 90 per cent of our staff were trained here, including myself."</p>
<p>The residential construction boom has seen a nationwide shortage of electrical apprentices, including in Whanganui, according to Neville Simpson from Master Electricians.</p>
<p>Mr Simpson said Etco - the electrical training provider - is currently training nearly 100 apprentices in 50 business throughout the lower North Island, but more were needed.</p>
<p>"Demand for electricians is soaring, but our organisation's members are struggling to find sufficient suitable candidates for apprenticeships," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Neilson said Strong Electrical was currently looking for an electrical apprentice and a refrigeration apprentice.</p>
<p>"It can be challenging to find the right calibre of person. They have to have the right skills, the right attitude, and good marks at school. We're particularly looking for people who have good marks in maths.</p>
<p>"I'm reasonably confident that we'll find someone," Mr Neilson said.</p>
<p>The company was often inundated by CVs from hopeful apprentices at the end of the year or the start of the school year, when high school students were considering their options.</p>
<p>He said an electrical apprentice could be a challenging undertaking. As well as on-the-job training, apprentices have to take night classes and regular block classes.</p>
<p>It takes four years to complete an apprenticeship.</p>
