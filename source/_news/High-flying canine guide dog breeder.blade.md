<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui golden retriever Abbot is a dog like no other.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The dog has travelled to Auckland five times on Air Chathams to help breed guide dogs for New Zealanders who are blind or have low vision.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five-year-old Abbot is one of the few stud dogs in the country registered with the Blind Foundation and has already bred 25 guide dogs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To support Abbot and the Blind Foundation, a group of Whanganui High School students are raising money for the annual Red Puppy Appeal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leaders of the group, Portia Sharp and Evan Ross, told the&nbsp;<em>Chronicle</em>&nbsp;the Blind Foundation was a charity that often slipped under the radar.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's not a cause that gets a lot of recognition and we love dogs. Abbot, and dogs like him, make a huge difference to so many people's lives so it's great to get behind something like this," Portia said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Abbot's owner, Sandy McAllen, has volunteered for the Blind Foundation for more than 10 years after she discovered all the work the charity does.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mrs McAllen said there was a lot of thought that went into selecting stud dogs because they needed to have the right personality.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Guide dogs are like people, they do everything people do ... go to the movies, go to restaurants, fly on aeroplanes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So they need to be really good with people, be calm and most importantly want to work."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said unfortunately her labrador didn't make the cut.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We get called up when a female dog is on heat and then fly up to Auckland with Abbot, he's a frequent flyer on Air Chathams."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mrs McAllen said after the puppies are born, puppy walkers have them for a year and there is constant interaction with the Blind Foundation to train them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I can't speak high enough for the work the Blind Foundation do with these puppies, they are truly amazing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Evan and Portia have rallied a group of 24 students to fundraise for the cause.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Home-made cookies in the shape of dogs and hot-dogs galore will be circulating around the school campus and all donations will go to the Blind Foundation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A street collection will also take place in Whanganui on March 23 and 24.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All funds will help train and breed guide dogs.</p>
