I feel honoured to secure my place into the prestigious Rotary National Science & Technology Forum in Auckland for 2 weeks in January 2021. 

In order to be accepted into the Forum, I had to undergo a rigorous application process, and then got selected for an interview. 

It will give me the opportunity to gain more specialized knowledge in the STEM sector, and my mind will be exposed to a huge variety of scientific fields from robotics and engineering, to chemistry and biology. 

I’m looking forward to attending this once in a lifetime opportunity - to connect with not only like-minded peers, but also to learn from leading scientists and innovators. 


It’s an amazing chance for me to learn more about my future options in STEM.
