<p class="element element-paragraph">All six teams in the Netball Whanganui premier one championship will have their sights firmly set on making the top four with round one of the competition ending on Monday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Defending champions and the only side to remain unbeaten Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau, Phillips Electrical Whanganui High School and 2017 runners-up Kaiwhaiki finished top three in round one after dominant wins on Monday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mixed form during round one left&nbsp;Mint Cafe Marist A1 in fourth, while Mere Te Aroha and Cullinane finished fifth and sixth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Points, however, will be taken through to round two that tips off next Monday before the competition takes a break the following week to allow U15 and U17 representative players to attend tournaments during the school holidays. Premier one competitioin will resume on Monday, July 23.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaierau dealt Marist a serious blow with its strong 58-31 win on Monday night, increasing the scoreline with each quarter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaierau coach Walter Edmonds said the early scoreline was not necessarily indicative of how the game went, although once her girls hit their straps they were able to draw away for a good win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For three quarters of the game, I thought Marist played well, the scoreline just didn't suggest that," Edmonds said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a good team effort, although I did think Hayley Addenbrooke had a great game. It was Hayley's last game for us before she takes off travelling overseas. She played centre in the first half and wing attack in the second."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>WHS</strong> completely dominated Mere Te Aroha with 71-26 full time score clear evidence coach Lisa Murphy and her young girls mean business.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our first thoughts are on making the top four now round one has finished and then we will reassess our goals," Murphy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Last night was just another great team display and my girls produced a good flow through the court. We showed very solid defence and attacking skills to get the ball to our shooters. I thought Rebecca Tamati had an excellent game at centre both in defence and on attack. She is growing into the game and linked wwell with Keilani Tyrell at wing attack.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My girls won't really get a break with seven of my 10-strong squad on rep duty during the school holidays. The U15 tournament is on in the first week of the holidays and the U17 the second," Murphy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaiwhaiki and Cullinane were reasonably well matched in the first two quarters with the former leading 15-11 and then 29-20 before ripping away to a 42-28 lead after the third, finally stretching out to a 59-44 victory at full time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaiwhaiki coach Te Rina Peina felt her girls were a "bit flat" early, but she was pleased to come away with a win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were a bit flat early and down to a bare eight players with the rest away through injury or illness. I felt Cullinane played really well, I was quite impressed by them. Our focus now, just like everyone else, is trying to make the top four and take it from there," Peina said.</p>
