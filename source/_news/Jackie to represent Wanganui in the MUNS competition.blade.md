<p>On Sunday 8 May <strong>Jackie Hazelhurst</strong> represented Wanganui High School at the Annual Wanganui region's United Nation Speech Competition.</p>
<p>The theme of the speech was "Human Security in Diverse Communities".</p>
<p>Jackie spoke most eloquently on the challenges facing the UN in the current climate, where increasing fears of security are undermining the willingness of countries to embrace diversity and change.</p>
<p>Her speech was both thought provoking and extremely topical and will be published in the local chapter's newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>Jackie has now qualified to represent this region in the National Competition to be held in Auckland on 27 May, and we wish her every success.</strong></p>
