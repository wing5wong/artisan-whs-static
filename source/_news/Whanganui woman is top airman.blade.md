<p><span>TOP AWARD: Former WHS student Corporal Keisha Malone with Chief of Air Force Air Vice-Marshal Tony Davies.<br />First excellance honour as Keisha follows great-uncle's footsteps.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Former Whanganui woman Corporal Keisha Malone has received the Royal New Zealand Air Force's inaugural Airman of the Year Award.</p>
<p>The award was given by the Chief of Air Force, Air Vice-Marshal Tony Davies, at RNZAF Base Auckland at Whenuapai in November, and acknowledges someone who was making a positive difference in the service.</p>
<p>Corporal Malone says she was surprised but proud to receive the award.&nbsp;<br />"It's incredibly humbling to get something for just doing my job," she said.</p>
<p>She believes the award was given to her because of her involvement in the Airforce mentoring scheme.</p>
<p>Started in 2009 at Base Ohakea, the scheme aims to provide professional and personal development for anyone keen to be involved.</p>
<p>"It doesn't have to be about the Airforce, it could be somebody wants to run a marathon, or open a business," said Corporal Malone.</p>
<p>She says she was mentored in the programme and wanted to give back.<br />"I just loved it and said how can I help."</p>
<p>At the award ceremony it was also acknowledged she has showed a keen participation in sports on base, and made efforts to streamline her workplace by starting a monthly meetings to resolve any work issues that arise.</p>
<p>Corporal Malone says always wanted to join the Airforce. Her great uncle was a Skyhawk pilot and Commanding Officer at Ohakea Airbase and straight after finishing Whanganui High School she joined up.</p>
<p>Her Commanding Officer, Wing Commander Susie Barns says the award was well deserved.<br />"The award acknowledges her leadership and passion for improvement."<br />"She is a real asset to the Air Force. She clearly has a bright future within the organisation, and is making a positive impact as a leader right now."</p>
<p>Air Vice-Marshal Tony Davies said nominations were of very high calibre and the selection process had been extremely competitive.</p>
