<p><strong>Whanganui High School motocross riders Blake Rountree, James Rountree and Oliver Dennison with their trophy from the Taranaki Secondary Schools championships on Sunday.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rountree brothers and Oliver Dennison were able to combine their efforts to hand Whanganui High School the top school prize at the Taranaki Secondary Schools Motocross Championships at the weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Blake and James Rountree have recently transferred to WHS.</p>
<p>Competing at the Barrett Motorcycle Park in New Plymouth, Dennison was second in the 250cc class for 15-19 year olds.</p>
<p>James Rountree came third in the 125cc class for 12-14 year olds, while Blake was eight in 125cc for 15-19 year olds.</p>
<p>Their combined points placed them six points ahead of the contingent from Wairarapa College, while Hawera High School was third.</p>
<p>Over 100 riders competed on the day, with eight schools contesting that championship.</p>
<p>It was a good followup for James Rountree and Dennison, who came fifth and ninth respectively in their divisions at the New Zealand Motocross GP in late January.</p>
