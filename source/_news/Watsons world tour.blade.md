<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Despite the jet lag, WHS student Keightley Watson had a strong performance at the Auckland Open Judo International alongside his follow Whanganui exponents last weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson had only just arrived back in the country after 16 days at the Olympic Training Centre in Budapest, Hungary, where he was undergoing assessment by the International Judo Federation (IJF) for both his future in the sport and his schooling.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Auckland International was held at ASB Stadium on Saturday and Sunday, with <strong>Watson taking silver in the Cadets plus 81kg grade</strong> <strong>after the final went two and a half minutes into extra time.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Ross Watson said Keightley lost to a much taller French Polynesian fighter by a penalty, but rectified when they rematched in the Junior Men's plus 100kg grade, with his son winning in less than 90 seconds to take the gold.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson departs this weekend for the IJF World Cadets competition, being held in Santiago de Chile from August 9-13, where he will represent New Zealand in the Over 90kg grade.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">From there, he will come home via Australia, where he will compete at the Sydney Judo International at Olympic Park.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Also in Auckland, City College fighter <strong>Finn Brown (former WHS student) competed in the Junior Mens under 73kg and took the Gold medal</strong>, with fellow club member Kaleb Glen getting bronze.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Junior Mens under 90kg, City College's Liam Goodhall won gold, and followed that up with bronze in the Senior Men under 90kg, while <strong>Jack Kinchella (former WHS student) won bronze in the Senior Men's under 66kg.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Keightley Watson's brother Callaghan claimed silver in the Senior boys +66kg division</strong>, and will also meet up with his older sibling in Sydney to compete on August 19-20.</p>
