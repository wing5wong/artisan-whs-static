<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This week is an exciting week for our school with the start of the redevelopment of our school outdoor courts. The WHS Board has been working hard to make sure the new facility is up to standard for our PE classes to use as part of their curriculum and a wide range of our sports teams for their training's.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There will be 5 netball courts, 6 tennis courts, 1 basketball court and 4 extra basketball hoops plus half a hockey turf. The facility will be laid with AstroTurf to accommodate all users. We will be updating our Facebook page and Website weekly with pictures and how the development is getting on!</p>
