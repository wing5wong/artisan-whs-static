<p><strong>2017&nbsp;Cultural Festival</strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you came to the cultural festival on the 17th of June you would have been able to smell a lot as soon as you stepped through the doors of the full WHS hall. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From German cake and Korean Bulgoge over Chinese coke chicken, Japanese sushi, fish balls from Hong Kong and Italian tiramisu there was a huge variety of traditional national foods. This was not even all of the food that was offered. From 6pm to 7pm that Saturday evening, teachers, students, families and friends came along to try the food and emptied the entire buffet so that there was not a single piece left! </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At 7pm, the amazing show started. Hosted by Joy and Luca, the international head prefects. They lead an evening full of cultural acts in the first half. Leaving the audience impressed, amazed with goosebumps or laughing, there was a little bit of everything. The whole journey started with &nbsp;Maori and Pasifika students singing and dancing. The international students then performed Japanese dance, a Chinese fan dance and a German drama act. Furthermore there was a language comedy and songs from Hong Kong, Korea and the Philippines. Following the first half, there was a short break for all the amazing technicians who helped and of course the performers. There was then a diverse second half with solo performances such as stunning singing,instrumental pieces on the piano, violin, drums or the Guzheng. To finish the show off, the Chinese teachers performed a breathtaking Tai chi and all the international students joined together for the final song. </span></span></p>
