<p class="element element-paragraph">After six years of trying, Revitalise Natural Health &amp; Fitness Centre has the trophy they have always coveted after receiving the pretigious Top Gym prize at the NABBA Manawatu/Wanganui Bodybuilding Championships on Saturday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Claiming several section awards and one overall prize among the around 30 competitors on the night, the Revitalise team's collective points were the most out of the other gyms who sent competitors to the Royal Wanganui Opera House.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After just missing out last year and not being confident of a trophy win in 2018, due to putting up so many first-time competitors, the Top Gym prize was a great relief for Revitalise trainer Audrey O'Keefe.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been too darn long," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The year I didn't expect it, and we won.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm a very proud mother hen."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The crown jewel for Revitalise was Michaela Sullenberger (former student), who won the most competitive division in the Women's Novice Shape, going up against seven other entries.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Then competing with the Open Shape entrant, Sullenberger was again judged the overall best to claim the Ms Manawatu/Wanganui Shape crown.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Sullenberger had started off the afternoon judging session teaming with clubmate Kyle O'Keefe (former student) to come runnerup in the Mixed Pairs competition.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It completes a great year of preparation for Sullenberger, who came third in the Novice Shape last year but had only recently come back into the sport after giving birth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On two months training, <strong>Kyle O'Keefe&nbsp;</strong> <strong>was going to win his Junior Men class</strong>, as was Revitalise's Taihape member Fiona Blyth, following six months getting ready for the Open Physique Women Short.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Carl Bond</strong>&nbsp;(former student) claimed his Novice Physique Men Short Grade.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Of the non-Revitalise local competitors to do well, <strong>Joseph Panui&nbsp;(WHS student)</strong>&nbsp;<strong>was second in the Teenage Men grade</strong>, competing at the same time as <strong>Kyle O'Keefe, while Wellington-based Joel Ashworth won the Mr Body-Board Shorts Novice crown.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After the afternoon judging, the winners were announced during the Saturday evening show part of the event, which Audrey O'Keeffe said was a reasonably good crowd, although smaller as they were having to compete against events like 'The Come Up' boxing show being held at the same time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">O'Keeffe said all of her competitors handled the pressure well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were all feeling chilled. I must admit, they were a relaxed bunch."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The atmosphere backstage helped, with the veterans of competition giving support to the others.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For some of the newbies, if you've got a competitor who is chill, it helps," said O'Keeffe.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were all really, really great.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a really nice show &ndash; because it was smaller, it was easier. Everything went like clockwork."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After months of specific dieting and avoiding tempting foods, O'Keeffe took her team out to celebrate at the Rutland Arms, one of the event sponsors, where she admits there were a few "nachos and wedges" consumed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She also had it on good authority that some of the team made a sly visit to KFC on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm a tough boss, they've back on track now."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Sullenberger</strong>, Blyth and <strong>Kyle O'Keeffe</strong> have to get back in training for the NABBA Hawke's Bay Championships, being held in Taradale on July 7.</p>
