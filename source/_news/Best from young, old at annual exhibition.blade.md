<p class="element element-paragraph">Artworks on show at Whanganui's Cooks Gallery cover a broad spectrum of mediums and a wide variety of artists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Arts Society Annual Exhibition includes a painting by most senior member Hilde Sutton through to a work by a young, junior member of the society.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have had a few new members join this year and we are always looking for more," says long-serving member Judy Webby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The society is Whanganui's oldest arts collective, formed in 1901, and there have been intergenerational memberships and family groups involved over the decades.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Webby, a former art teacher at Whanganui High School, has some of her own paintings on show including a scene of the O'Leary farm.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Painter and potter John Singleton has a selection of his two and three-dimensional works on show and there are paintings by Richard Cotgrove, former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Stephanie Lockwood</strong> and Heather Spooner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our members work in a diverse range of mediums and there are some beautiful works in this show," says Webby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They provide some excellent examples of the width and depth of experience and disciplines."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Most of the works are for sale and will make perfect Christmas gifts says Webby.</p>
