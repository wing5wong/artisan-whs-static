<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui artist and teacher Graham Hall's latest exhibition, Handscapes, at Space Gallery is an exploration of the relationships between humans and physical environments.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Each print in the series of woodcuts features a human hand and a familiar local landscape.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>A Bird in the Hand</em>&nbsp;depicts two huia birds perched on an outstretched hand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">" There were multitudes of huia in this region once," says the artist. "They are a symbol of things lost from the landscape."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Heavy Hand</em>&nbsp;features a fist covered with an industrial glove and a landscape showing fencing and an unpaved road leading round a bend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's nothing wrong with fencing off land but it's about the care that's needed," says Hall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The artist says he started the series in 2015 but most of the works were completed this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"While there are several natural controls and events, we act as the dominant force in many of the earth's physical and biological systems. The human relationship with the landscape is one of constant change."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The artist says the series is partly inspired by a quote from late musician and author Leonard Cohen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To every people the land is given on condition. Perceived or not, there is a covenant, beyond the constitution, beyond sovereign guarantee, beyond the nation's sweetest dreams of itself."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Handscapes by Graham Hall is open for viewing at Space Studio and Gallery, 64 Taupo Quay until Friday, July 28. Open Tuesday to Thursday 9am-1pm. Friday and Saturday 9am-1pm. Closed Sunday and Monday.</strong></p>
