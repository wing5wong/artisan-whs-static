<p><strong>Chris </strong><span><strong>Breuer</strong> and <strong>Daniel Kauika</strong>, both students from Wanganui High School, have been included on the&nbsp;</span>Hurricanes U18 Players Selected For Development Camp on 17 June 2015.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Fifty seven of the Hurricanes region&rsquo;s top under 18 years of age rugby players, have been selected to take part in the annual Development Camp being held in Feilding, from 6 to 10 July.</span></p>
<p>Representing 21 different secondary schools, 17 of the players are from Wellington, 15 from Hawkes Bay, 11 from Manawatu, 6 from Poverty Bay, 4 from Wairarapa-Bush, 3 from Wanganui and 1 from East Coast.</p>
<p>Camp Director and Hurricanes Development Coach Darren Larsen is looking forward to working with those who&rsquo;ve been selected. &ldquo;The Camp is run by a group of the region&rsquo;s top rugby development people, including trainers, nutritionists and mental skills coaches. We aim that the Camp will help those selected to take another step forward in the achievement of their rugby goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Convenor of Selectors, David King said the quality of those nominated by their schools made the process of selecting a final group to participate in the Camp a challenging task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hurricanes region is fortunate to have a large number of secondary schools offering strong rugby development for our teenage players, which made this year&rsquo;s selection process particularly demanding. Of those nominated, we believe we have selected the best representation of skills and talent for 2015.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U18 Development Camp forms part of the comprehensive programme for teenage rugby administered by the Hurricanes Youth Rugby Council. Council Chairman, Gordon Noble-Campbell said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Camp is but one of a number of exciting development opportunities for players in our region this year, including the Under 16 Tournament, Under 19 Seeding Tournament for the Jock Hobbs Memorial Tournament and the Under 20 Heartland Development Series. We hope that all those selected for this Camp take full advantage of the opportunity they have been given.&rdquo;</p>
