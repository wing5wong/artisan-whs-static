<p><span>WINNING TEAM:&nbsp;The Wanganui Special Olympics bocce team (including <strong>Grant McCullough</strong> who works as a Teacher Aide in the Te Atawhai Special Unit at WHS) and supporters celebrate the team's success at the National Summer Games.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A Whanganui team has taken out the top spot in bocce at the Special Olympics New Zealand National Summer Games 2017.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Summer Games is New Zealand's largest event for athletes with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The team of eight from the Wanganui Special Olympics Club has been preparing for the event for 18 months under coach Paul Gibson. The athletes are Cathy Boyle, Judith Bradley, Brigitte Brightwell, Linda Fredricksen, <strong>Grant McCullough</strong>, Darryl Smith, Thomas McLeod and Paul Raumaewa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During the week at the games, the players bowled in teams and pairs against other clubs from around the country. All team members took home medals, with the women's team winning their division and the men runners-up in their division.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm extremely proud of the way the team has supported each other both on and off the court," Mr Gibson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Team member Cathy Boyle, a Global Messenger (ambassador) for Special Olympics New Zealand, was incredibly proud of herself and the team, and felt "bubbled" to have received the awards.</p>
