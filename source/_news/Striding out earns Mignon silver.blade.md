<p><strong>Whanganui distance runner and fulltime Whanganui High School teacher Mignon Stevenson has not rested on her laurels since winning national silver in the Athletics NZ marathon late last month.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Three marathons in three weeks has culminated in a national silver medal for plucky Wanganui Harrier Club runner Mignon Stevenson.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On May 28 the 62-year-old Stevenson finished second in her 60-64-year age group at the Palmerston North marathon clocking 4 hours 22:36 and on June 4 she finished fourth in her age group at the Christchurch marathon in 4 hours 23:59.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the third over the 42.2km trip on June 18, Stevenson finished second in the 60-69-year age group at the Gazley Volkswagen Wellington marathon in 4 hours 24:44. The Wellington marathon also doubled as the Athletics New Zealand Marathon Championship earning Stevenson a National silver medal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not content with these three marathons in a three week period, Stevenson laced up the running shoes on July 1 to finished third in the North Island Cross Country Championships where she was the only member of the large Wanganui Harrier Club contingent to win a medal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Then on July 15 Stevenson won her age group at the Manawatu-Whanganui Centre Cross Country Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After taking a short breather, Stevenson will represent the Manawatu-Whanganui Centre at the New Zealand Cross Country Championships in Auckland on July 30.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While delighted to have won the national medal, Stevenson has taken her busy schedule in her stride and is now heavily focused on representing the centre at the national cross country event in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I love cross country. It helps keep the body balanced at my stage in life, although I still enjoy marathons too," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I maintain my fitness through training, but I also race a lot and that keeps me in trim. The key in recovery after racing and sport massage, yoga, swimming and sauna is great for that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The fulltime Whanganui High School teacher said she notes down her training and racing schedules, but does not consciously add up the mileage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have no idea the mileage I do in training, but I know I need to keep it up because my age group I race in is extremely competitive, there are some very fit women out there."</p>
