On the 15th of September, I received a very rare opportunity to venture out to sea for ten days.

I journeyed with strangers who soon became family on the beautiful ship, the ’Spirit of New Zealand’. I would like to start by thanking Steve Thoms, who funded my trip and voyage. I am so grateful for his generosity. I would like to share my journey with you all. 

Day one was nerve-wracking. I was nervous enough finding my way through Auckland Airport. When I arrived at the ship, staring up at those giant masts and huge sails, I could not quite believe my eyes. It was incredible to think that I would soon be sailing on it. My first thought looking at the boat was, “this is not a sailing boat, it is a pirate ship.” It was surreal. 
Everyone on the boat was so friendly, including the crew and the trainees. It helped that the trainees were in the same boat, literally. They were there just as I was, with no expectations or judgements. That is the great thing about ‘Spirit’. 

Day two was surprising. Nothing had prepared me for the cold morning swims at 6:30 am. We would wake up and jump in the freezing water, then swim to the ladder to climb aboard. The warm thirty second showers made up for it, however and so did the chef J.R’s cooking. The swims got easier as the days went on. The first time in the water, I was so frozen I could barely move and the last jump off the yardee swing was actually enjoyable.
 
 My greatest achievement had to be tackling the mast, of course. I was freaking out on my way up but when you look up instead of down, it makes climbing a whole lot easier and it is incredible what you can do if you have a bit of faith. The view was incredible. I climbed right to the top, with support and encouragement from the crew.  Even though I did not want to do it, looking back I feel so proud of myself now. We sailed from Auckland Harbour to all sorts of places, including Te Haupa Island, Motukawao, The Coromandel and Waitemata Harbour. It was incredible seeing the beauty of New Zealand from a different perspective. Throughout the voyage, we played beach games, team-building exercises, learnt different rope knots and patterns and mini-sailed in the luggers with our watch boards. My watch was called Starboard B, better known as Starry B. Every night we would have an activity in the after cabin. The sing-off was my personal favourite. 

On Day nine (trainee day) of the voyage, the Captain decided to hand the boat over to the trainees and we had to vote in a captain and crew. With eight days of learning behind us it was our time to shine. We sailed the boat, with a few laughs of course, but overall a decent effort. We did not sink it which was a bonus. 

By day ten everyone was emotional. We had all become so close and being together while facing challenges, we had become like family. Just like any farewell, it was hard to say ‘goodbye’. 
Looking back it was a huge achievement. I overcame my fear of heights along with many other things. And the challenges I faced on the boat have taught me so much that I can apply to many future situations in life.
