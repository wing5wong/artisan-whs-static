<p>Former WHS student Hannah Smith helped guide several Whanganui artistic skaters to medals at the Central Districts league last weekend.</p>
<p>A large squad of 22 artistic skaters was able to attend Central Districts Roller Skating League last Saturday in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The group had a very successful day at the Pascal Street Arena, competing in 14 of the 19 events and returning with 11 golds, 5 silver and 5 bronze medals.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Stephanie Rush said the skaters were aged from 5-14 years, and skilfully coached by the Hannah Smith of Wanganui Amateur Roller Skating Club (Artistic Section).</p>
<p>"Over the last year, volunteer coach Hannah has built up a squad of five members to 25," said Rush.</p>
<p>The club is hosting to 'Learn to Skate' sessions each Thursday at 5.30pm at the Hatrick St Rink.</p>
