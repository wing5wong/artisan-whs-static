<p>Former Wanganui High School student Kyle de Koning and mother Ananda were all smiles after NCEA results were released to students yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of high school students leaping out of bed yesterday morning to check exam results was Whanganui's Kyle de Koning.</p>
<p>NCEA results for Year 11, 12 and 13 students became available on the NZQA website shortly after 7am.</p>
<p>A Year 13 student at Wanganui High School last year, Kyle was pleased with his results, gaining over 100 credits from his exams and internal assessments throughout the year, the vast majority at excellence level.</p>
<p>"It was maybe a little bit better than I expected," he said.</p>
<p>"Some things I was less confident on and still got excellence."</p>
<p>Kyle's results will give him a top rank score when it comes to applying for bio-medicine which he plans to study at Auckland University in 2017.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he is taking a gap year this year, probably to work in Wellington.</p>
<p>Kyle studied mostly maths and science subjects in 2015.</p>
<p>"I guess I just like quite factual things," he said.</p>
<p>"It's more like you can depend on yourself and not a marker. If there's a right or wrong answer you can just get it right."</p>
<p>He hadn't caught up with his friends yet but said there would be some Facebook messaging later yesterday.</p>
<p>"Usually me and my friends ... we get together (to check results) but I just couldn't wait this morning."</p>
<p>Kyle has achieved a similarly high level in both level one and two after moving to New Zealand from South Africa nearly three years ago.</p>
<p>There were 119 NCEA exams sat over four weeks at the end of last year, with papers marked by panels around the country before Christmas.</p>
<p>From today students who have paid their fees and completed NCEA or University Entrance will be able to order their certificates online. Answer booklets will be returned from late January.</p>
<p>New Zealand Scholarship results are due out next month.</p>
