Congratulations to our two winners of the Whanganui High School Rowing Grocery Grab Raffle- Roos van der Wees and Bruce Tonkin. 
They had 4 minutes each to race around Pak n Save on Sunday and what a fine job they did! 😊

A HUGE thank you to Tania Taylor at Pak n Save for their sponsorship and support for this raffle! 

Xmas spirit was out in full as Bruce had decided to donate his whole trolley of food to families in need at Xmas time! 

He approached Family Works who found two families and Bruce met them today and donated the groceries to them both! Bruce was awarded a certificate of kindness from Family Works! 👏
Well done to both our winners!! 💚💛🎄
