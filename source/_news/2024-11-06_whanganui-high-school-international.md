🌏 Whanganui  Delegation Makes Waves in Okinawa! 

Yesterday, our team had the honour of visiting the Okinawa Board of Education and Naha Kokusai High School, where we led an interactive lesson on New Zealand.  Students enjoyed partaking in a quiz, sang waiata, and were introduced to some of our unique Kiwiana items. We even made it onto Okinawa’s local TV news!
