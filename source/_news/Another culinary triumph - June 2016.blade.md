<p><strong>COOKING CHAMPIONS: Olivia Caird (left) and Charlotte Taylor are heading to the National Secondary Schools Culinary Challenge to be held in Auckland in August.</strong></p>
<p>Charlotte Taylor and Olivia Caird have been on a culinary roller coaster in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Whanganui High School Year 12 students recently won the annual omelette contest held at UCOL, with Olivia gaining individual first place for her sweet raspberry omelette.</p>
<p>As if that was not enough of a feather in their chef hats, they went on to bring home one gold and three silver medals from the Taranaki Hospitality Competition last week.</p>
<p>Teacher Linda Hardcastle said they did themselves and the school proud because the competition was very high-pressure.</p>
<p>"They had 90 minutes to prepare four entrees and four mains, which had to include specified ingredients," she said.</p>
<p>Despite having problems with a pasta machine while preparing ravioli blette bleu (ravioli filled with silver beet, bacon and blue cheese, served with parmesan, spring onion cream sauce with a drizzle of truffle oil, and toasted pine nuts) the girls triumphed. They put in about 120 hours of preparation and were mentored by Big Orange chef Dean Wong.</p>
<p>And it is not over yet - they will compete in the National Secondary Schools Culinary Challenge to be held in Auckland in August. Charlotte said she would like to be a chef while Olivia thought she might study food science.</p>
