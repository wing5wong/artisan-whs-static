<p><span>WHS Volleyball teams competing at the National Secondary School Volleyball Champs held at Central Energy Trust Arena, Palmerston North, 26 March - 31 March 2017.</span></p>
<p><span>The boys and girls senior teams both competed in the secondary school national volleyball tournament in Palmerston North last week. &nbsp;They were a great bunch to take away and did the school proud&nbsp;both on and off the court. &nbsp;Both teams had a majority of younger players who gained valuable experience from the tournament and learnt a lot. The tournament had 168 teams competing, so was a huge event. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The boys finished 7th in their grade out of 12 teams, while the girls finished 11th out of 12. &nbsp;All games however were really close and the experience gained this year will really help them perform at the next level in 2018. &nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The teams want to acknowledge all the hard work put in by their fabulous coaches, Iliesa Tamaniyaga, Martin Waldegrave and Shaun Tyson-Tahana. &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp; <br />They would also&nbsp;like to thank Pak n&nbsp;Save and New World for their generous support which was much appreciated.&nbsp;</span></p>
