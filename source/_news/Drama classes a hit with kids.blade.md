<p>Whanganui High School drama student Ali Gammeter, 15, joined the workshop as a keen drama hobbiest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lights, camera, action. For the first time ever Centrepoint Theatre (CT) Summer School is taking the stage in Whanganui.</p>
<p>The week-long intensive drama programme, aimed at theatre enthusaists aged 13-18, began on Monday Janurary 23 and will run through to Friday January 27.</p>
<p>Centrepoint Theatre has offered the Summer School in Palmerston North, initally on a biligual basis, since 2009.</p>
<p>Head organiser Ria Simmons said CT are pleased to expand the programme to Whanganui and hopes to make it an annual affair.</p>
<p>"We have changed the programme up a little bit to focus on providing a sample of a whole range of skills", Ms Simmons said.</p>
<p>The workshop kicked off with met and greet icebreakers as well as scipted analysis and acting with text. Students will also practise an introduction into stage fighting, devising physical theatre and musical theatre. A final showcasing for friends and family will conclude the week on Friday.</p>
<p>Eight girls enrolled in the Whanagnui programme, seven local and one visiting from Wellington.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School drama student Ali Gammeter, 15, joined the workshop as a keen drama hobbiest. She said she is thrilled with the group and the programme so far.</p>
<p>"The stage fighting has been a big highlight, I've never learnt it before", said Ms Gammeter.</p>
<p>Ms Simmons said in her experience there are limited teachers in stage fighting so it is good information for the kids to learn.</p>
<p>The programmes uses skilled practitioners "who keep theatre in New Zealand thriving".</p>
<p>CT is the only professional theatre in New Zealand outside of the four main centres of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.</p>
