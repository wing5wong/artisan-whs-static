<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui off road motorcycle racer Seth Reardon is well on track for a podium finish in the National Cross Country Championship with a solid performance at the weekend on a borrowed machine.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reardon won the pro 250cc class in the Northern Belray Series earlier in the year on his Yamaha YZ250FX, then blew up his bike at the Masterton leg of MNZ North Island Cross Country Championship series a fortnight ago. Reardon still managed a fourth in Masterton to remain in series contention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>After being loaned a bike the teenager rode well in Taupo on Sunday in the fourth and final round of the North Island championship to claim victory in the under 300cc four-stroke class for the series.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It wasn't plain sailing for Reardon placing 4-1-4-3 in the North Island series having difficulties in the first round and then mechanical problems at Masterton while leading the third round. However, the youngster had the grit and determination to still take the series class win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Taupo round was also the third round of the National XC series, where Reardon is currently sitting at the top of the points table for the under 300cc four-stroke class going into the fourth and final round in Mosgiel on May 12.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the interim, the enduro season kicks off in Wellington this Saturday with the first round of the Central Enduro Series followed by the first two rounds of the National Enduro Championships in Whangamata on Saturday week and Tokoroa on the Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cross country racing is usually over fast, rough terrain with the odd technical steep hill climbs over a three-hour duration, only stopping once for fuel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Enduros involve a lot more technical riding, including river crossings, very steep terrain and lots of mud, lasting around five hours racing against the clock and other riders. Both disciplines are extremely demanding on man and machine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On the local scene, the Wanganui Motorcycle Club is hosting round one of Winter Motocross Series at the club track at Languard Bluff this Sunday. Entry is free for spectators.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It takes a lot of commitment from the team to race at this level and Reardon could not achieve these results without the great support from sponsors that include; Beancounter 24/7, Dunlop Tyres, Eks Goggles, Maxima Oils, W&amp;W Construction, Bailey Motorcycles, Boss Engineering and CFX Seats.</p>
