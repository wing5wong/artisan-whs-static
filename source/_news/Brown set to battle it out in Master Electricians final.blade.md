<p><span>Former Whanganui High School student Nathan Brown set to battle it out in Master Electricians Challenge final.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A passion for sound engineering led to Nathan Brown becoming an electrical apprentice &ndash; and now he&rsquo;s reached the national final of the industry&rsquo;s toughest contest for trainees.&nbsp;</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Next month, Nathan, 21, from Springvale, will be among 10 top electrical apprentices battling it out in the four- day Master Electricians Challenge final, to be held in Auckland from 22 August.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The finalists, five in the Domestic</span><span class="text_exposed_show">/Commercial and five in the Industrial division, scored the highest number of points out of 150 entrants in regional competitions countrywide.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to do after leaving school,&rdquo; said Nathan, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m very into sound engineering, mixing music for bands, and have always been fascinated with taking things apart and getting them working so that&rsquo;s what attracted me to an electrical apprenticeship.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">&ldquo;I just really enjoy the work &ndash; particularly the variety and the problem-solving aspect of it.&rdquo;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">Nathan says a deeper understanding of how electrical equipment works has enhanced his sound engineering skills too. He still does mixing for bands and has volunteered at the Royal Wanganui Opera House and worked on sound for events such as Homegrown.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">He began working for Rob Chamberlain Electrical in 2014, studying for his apprenticeship through training provider etco, a subsidiary of Master Electricians and is due to qualify as an electrician in April next year.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">For the Challenge final, the apprentices will face five rounds of two-hour long modules, completed over three days of competition, interspersed with off-site challenging activities, team bonding, and life changing experiences.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">Current champions Chabb Chia (Domestic/Commercial) and Logan Sanders (Industrial) have also gone on to enjoy international opportunities, with the titles opening doors for them to represent New Zealand at WorldSkills Competition events in China and Abu Dhabi.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">Master Electricians Chief Executive Neville Simpson said apprentices are in high demand across all trades in New Zealand and the goal of The Challenge is to promote the benefits of electrical apprenticeships.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">The others in the final include four from Auckland and one each from Ngaruawahia, Waimate, Temuka, Wellington and Tauranga.</span></span></p>
