<p>If The Remnant can clean up Smokefreerockquest regionals with less than a week's practice imagine what the band can do three months on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When the Whanganui High School band won the regionals in June the musicians had not long been playing together and wrote a song in week leading up to what was their debut live performance.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it didn't stop them winning the event at the Royal Wanganui Opera House and earning a spot in the nationals finals of the Tangata Beats section.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The five-piece, which also won best vocalists at the Whanganui event, is now putting the final touches on the set for the final in Auckland on Friday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Remnant are Wiremu Rogan, Cypress Kani-Hurinui, Joshua Waitai, Chester Nevil and Toka Poa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cypress, Wiremu and Toka met doing kapa haka and singing together and later had the idea to form the band.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a lot of last-minute stuff. We wrote a song that week and, yeah, took it out," Cypress said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wiremu said at the time the band was "really outside of our comfort zones playing in front of a big crowd like that".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had practised lots, we were really committed and we all played as a team - our vocals and harmonies were really good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band has original songs, including one called&nbsp;<em>Youth</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"We were trying to uplift the spirit of the youth and make them realise that they're gifted in every way possible and in their own way," Wiremu said.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>The Tangata Beats finals with be held at Auckland Girls Grammar School's Dorothy Winstone Centre on Friday 21 September with the national Rockquest finals the following night.</span></p>
