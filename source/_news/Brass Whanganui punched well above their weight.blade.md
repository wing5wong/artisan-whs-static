<p><strong>WHS student Ethan Mancer was part of Brass Whanganui who punched well above their weight at the National Brass Band Competitions in Napier over the weekend.</strong></p>
<p>Competing in the B-grade section, Brass Whanganui came first in their grade in the street march - achieving third place over all grades - and third in their grade in the stage events.</p>
<p>They gained a higher placing in the street march than some of the A-grade bands.</p>
<p>A number of band members also achieved second placings in some of the solo sections: Riki Wainhouse, at the age of just 12, in the under-15 cornet; Jonathon Greenwell in the open bass trombone; Matt Johnston in the open euphonium; WHS student <strong>Ethan Mancer</strong> in the junior euphonium; and Ian O'Malley and Hamish Jellyman in the open duet.</p>
<p>Musical director Bruce Jellyman said he was "delighted" with the results.</p>
<p>"The national champs are the holy grail of brass bands, and we were competing against some extremely good bands.</p>
<p>"We couldn't have wished for better results. They were the result of two months of extremely hard work from the band," Mr Jellyman said.</p>
<p>He said Brass Whanganui was in a "re-building phase" and was not yet ready to move up to A-grade.</p>
<p>Bands compete in four grades, with A being the top and D the lowest.</p>
<p>Mr Jellyman said it was a big mission to get all 38 band members plus their kit - including large musical instruments such as bass drums and tubas - to Napier and back.</p>
