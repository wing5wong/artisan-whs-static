<p>Having spina bifida and relying on a wheelchair and modified car for mobility has never been an impediment to Christie Teki.</p>
<p>Against all the recognised odds and certainly against the advice of well-meaning friends, family and medical practitioners, Christie became a mum to Nathan, a story she told in her book published in 2015,&nbsp;<em>Just Want One ... More</em>.</p>
<p>Now, continuing with publishing, Christie has teamed up with a talented illustrator to produce a children's book,&nbsp;<em>Mummy Has Wheels</em>.</p>
<p>Michelle Sigley, artist, tattooist and good friend, has illustrated the first of what promises to be a series of children's books. Initial reaction from readers of the right age group has been positive.</p>
<p>"There's a sequel on the way, which is a children's version of my story of having Nathan," says Christie.</p>
<p>Future books will share the theme of living with a disability, she says.</p>
<p>"But not too in-your-face," says Michelle.</p>
<p>They are also looking at producing a Maori language version of the book.</p>
<p>Christie and Michelle have set themselves a challenge with&nbsp;<em>Mummy Has Wheels</em>. If they sell 100 copies they are both going sky-diving.</p>
<p>"I want to children to read that just because someone's parent has a disability, it doesn't mean they can't do anything," says Christie. "That's the message - it doesn't limit them.</p>
<p>"And just because Mummy's in a wheelchair it doesn't mean that child misses out on anything."</p>
<p>Michelle completed her Arts degree in Auckland and moved to Whanganui where she owned Animania in Guyton St for seven years. She sold the pet shop and now focuses on commission art work and operates a tattoo studio.</p>
<p>Copies of&nbsp;<em>Mummy Has Wheels</em>&nbsp;are $15 each through the&nbsp;<em>Mummy Has Wheels</em>&nbsp;Facebook page.</p>
