<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui netball girls were run ragged, yet still improved on last season to finish 18th at the U17 National Championships in Pukekohe, Auckland on Thursday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After two days of pool play, the girls finished fourth in Pool G and crossed over to the middle section play offs for a top 17-32 finish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The first cross over game was a 31-41 win over hosts Pukekohe, they then went on to win 40-34 against Thames Valley guaranteeing them a top 16-20 finish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the morning session on Thursday Whanganui played and beat Whangarei 41-30 to go into a play-off for 17-18 with Waitakere 1, but unfortunately the tired legs told and the girls went down 56-24 to finish the tournament in 18th spot. Last season the Whanganui U17 reps finished 21st.<span style="background-color: #e2e2e2;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We didn't have the best of days on day one, but we picked up through the week and I'm very proud of the girls," coach Lisa Murphy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In the final match against Waitakere 1, who had beaten us earlier in the week, we started well and it was 10-all after the first quarter. The second quarter was also pretty close at 21-19 to them, but in the third and final quarters our legs were getting tired. I didn't have much of an interchange for the midfield, so those girls were particularly run ragged.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We did finish better than last year, so that was good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Eight of the girls play in the Whanganui Premier A1 competition, including seven of Murphy's Whanganui High School A1 side.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They will have to rest up for when the premier competition resumes after the holidays on Monday," Murphy said.</p>
