<p class="element element-paragraph">Animals and gardens are Karen Hurndell's passions so she decided to combine them to help two Whanganui charitable organisations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Rescued Animal Garden Ramble was held at Hurndell's Cathro Rd property on Sunday, March 10, to support ARAN (Animal Rescue Action Network) and Precious Paws Paradise cat rescue.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Visitors could bring their well-behaved dogs and wander around Hurndell's extensive garden, paying their entry by gold coin or cat food or dog toys.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These organisations totally rely on donations - they get no funding from anywhere," Hurndell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I love animals and gardening so I decided to combine them to help with donations."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wendy Ward, co-founder of ARAN Animal Rescue, said the organisation was set up in Taumarunui about six or seven years ago to rescue impounded dogs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So many are beautiful family dogs that can be rehomed," Ward said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ward and her co-founder rescued about 400 dogs while they were based in Taumarunui and, coincidentally, both now live in Whanganui. ARAN is now a national dog rescue network.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We will take any dog," Ward said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Very occasionally it doesn't work out but we will give it a go. They go to homes all over New Zealand, though mostly in the North Island.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have amazing volunteers. One man drives from Wellington regularly to pick up dogs that are going to be fostered in Wellington and rehomed from there. There's a lot of work involved in organising transport for the dogs."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">ARAN is looking for volunteers who are willing to transport dogs to Taumarunui, Auckland or Wellington. Anyone interested can contact Wendy Ward on 021 0858 3665.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mary Lou Nation, who runs Precious Paws Paradise, fosters dumped, abandoned and unwanted cats and kittens and finds them forever homes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sunday's event included a raffle of items donated by Vets on Carlton and animal beds from Mitre 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">People who would like to assist ARAN or Precious Paws can make donations at Vets on Carlton, Hurndell said.</p>
