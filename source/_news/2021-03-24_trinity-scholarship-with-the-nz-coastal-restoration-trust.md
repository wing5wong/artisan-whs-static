I recently won a scholarship to attend the New Zealand Coastal Restoration Trust's annual conference held in and around Whanganui from 9-12 March 2021. 

The annual conference is an event where environmental conservation leaders and workers meet together to learn, discuss current restoration projects and network amongst New Zealand's leading conservation experts, scientists and workers. 

It was an amazing opportunity to explore this industry and to learn more about our environment and what we can do to help it. 

I got the opportunity to earn this scholarship because of the coastal restoration group I volunteer with regularly, Coastcare Castlecliff, who are aiming to restore Castecliff's sand dunes which are a vital part of our coastal ecosystem and a necessary protection barrier for future sea-level rise and coastal erosion.
