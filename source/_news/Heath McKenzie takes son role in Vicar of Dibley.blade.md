<p>Essential&nbsp;<em>Vicar of Dibley</em>&nbsp;characters are David and Hugo Horton, father and son, played by Colin McKinney and <strong>Heath McKenzie</strong> in Amdram's soon-to-be-staged production.</p>
<p>"I came here in December," says Colin. "I'm very keen on acting so I'm enjoying the opportunity of getting back into it."</p>
<p>Colin came here from Twizel, where there is no theatre. His last stage appearance was about five years ago when he was living in Christchurch, where he appeared in a McPhail and Gadsy play called&nbsp;<em>Sweet 16</em>.</p>
<p>"It was set in a motel and I was the motelier," he says. "It had never been staged before: it was the first performance."</p>
<p>Colin has a daughter and grandchildren in Whanganui. "That seemed to be a pretty good reason to come here."</p>
<p>His return to theatre was always part of the plan, having performed in dozens of productions in Hamilton and Christchurch.</p>
<p>Heath is a nephew of director Chris McKenzie, but he brings solid credentials to the comedic role. Whanganui theatre-goers will remember him as Dick Whittington in a recent pantomime, also directed by Chris.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Vicar of Dibley</em>, his character Hugo is young, naive and smitten by Alice Tinker, the verger, played by <strong>Tori Whibley.</strong></p>
<p>"Tori and I have worked together before in Dick Whittington," he says. "I've also been the Dormouse in&nbsp;<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>&nbsp;and I was a weasel in&nbsp;<em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, in both of which I was, coincidentally, working with Chris."</p>
<p>Chris played the Mad Hatter and Toad. "<em>Dick Whittington</em>&nbsp;was my first big role."</p>
<p><strong>Heath</strong> was involved in Amdram Starlets for a couple of years.</p>
<p>"I learned acting at Amdram then did plays around town, because I just love it."</p>
<p>The <strong>Year 11</strong> <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> student credits stagework, including singing, for increased confidence. He's also guitarist in a band preparing for this year's Smokefree Rockquest.</p>
<p>Both Colin and Heath love&nbsp;<em>Vicar of Dibley</em>.</p>
<p>"I can't wait for it to start," says Colin. "It's very funny: the audience is going to love it."</p>
