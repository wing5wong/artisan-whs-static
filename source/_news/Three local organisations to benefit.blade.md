<p>Wanganui Road Rodders held the second Protecta Insurance River City Park Up at Whanganui City College grounds recently. The Park Up again attracted in excess of 500 vehicles and a large number of people who came to see what was on show.</p>
<p>The open-air vehicle display was an opportunity for enthusiasts to participate in an event which showcased a wide range of vehicles for the public to view and&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">donate to local charities.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The club was again fortunate to secure Protecta Insurance as principal sponsor of the event which enabled the club to donate the proceeds of nearly $3,500 from the gate to three local organisations - Coastguard, Riding for the Disabled and Surf Life Saving Wanganui - who were delighted with the opportunity to be part of the day.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Along with vintage cars and motorbikes, four-wheel drive competition vehicles and hot rods, the Coastguard had their rescue boat on display. The mobile dental unit which is normally only seen in school grounds was also on show for the public to view and talk to the dental team about the services provided. Rocker cover racing and trial bike riding displays demonstrating balance and riding skills provided the crowds with entertainment.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Wanganui Road Rodders Vice President, Gillian Hooper said the club is hoping to run the event again in 2019.</span></p>
