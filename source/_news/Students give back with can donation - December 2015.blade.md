<p>Wanganui City Mission foodbank shelves got a top-up yesterday thanks to donations from year 9 and 10 students at Wanganui High School.</p>
<p>The students have been giving back to the community this week doing volunteer work and they were also asked to bring either a dollar or a can donation to school.</p>
<p>More than 160 cans were collected and City Mission administrator Justin Mulligan said they would be a big help in topping up foodbank stocks because there is usually high demand during the holiday season.</p>
<p>"We are quite well stocked since the foodbank drive in October but we are always thankful for donations," he said.</p>
<p>Mission staff are preparing for the annual Christmas dinner at the War Memorial Centre and Mr Mulligan said they needed volunteers to help out on the day.</p>
<p>Tickets for the Christmas dinner are available from the City Mission centre at 62a Taupo Quay or the Zest store at 163 Victoria Ave, and cost $3 for individuals or $2 for family members attending together.</p>
<p>"There will be door sales available, as well, but we really need volunteer helpers to make it happen."</p>
<p>Anyone who will be available to help on Christmas day can contact the City Mission on 06 345 2139.</p>
