<p><span>KIWI STYLE: Whanganui's Richie Dibben (former WHS student) wins round 2 of the FIM Asia Supermoto Championship in Indonesia at the weekend ahead of Frenchman Lewis Cornish (left) and Malaysian Modh Al Amirul in third.</span></p>
<p>Whanganui's Richie Dibben has won round 2 of the FIM Asia Supermoto Championship after using good old Kiwi ingenuity and No8 wire to get to the start line in Malang, Indonesia at the weekend.</p>
<p>Dibben was invited to race in the series as a late replacement for injured New Zealand Suzuki Series Motard champion Duncan Hart from Tauranga.</p>
<p>A two-time Suzuki Series champion himself, Dibben finished 14th in round 1 in Newcastle, Australia earlier this month after being shunted from pillar to post by a rival rider. He eventually crashed damaging his Honda CRF450 ending his Aussie mission after qualifying second fastest and finishing third in race one.</p>
<p>For the Indonesian leg Dibben was given a bike to race by the organisers and only had to bring his own wheels and tyres.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the front tyre he took to Malang did not fit the machine.<br />Not to be denied Dibben and his mechanic brother Michael drew on all their Kiwi ingenuity and made the wheel fit witth help from a rival Malaysian team.</p>
<p>Dibben qualified fastest, won the top 10 shootout to gain pole position and then won both races in pouring rain and high humidity after tight battles up front at the Kanjuruhan Stadium in the suburbs of Malang City in East Java.</p>
<p>Dibben was due to fly back into Whanganui last night after the long haul back from Indonesia. The Chronicle plans to catch up with the motorcycle mechanic when he is back on the job at Keown Honda today.</p>
