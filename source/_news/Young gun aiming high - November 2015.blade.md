<p>GREAT SHOT: WHS student Bradley McDowell won the young gun national Cowboy Action Shooting title.</p>
<p>Bradley McDowell is one sharp shooter.</p>
<p>The Wanganui High School student recently took out the cowboy action shooting national title for the second time and now has a world title in his sights.</p>
<p>Having been in the sport for little over two years, Bradley already has a swag of national and North Island medals around his neck.</p>
<p>Cowboy action shooting involves shooting a series metal plate targets with three types of guns - a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun - in a memorised sequence. The goal is to complete the sequence as quickly possible. Missed targets however incur costly time penalties.</p>
<p>Bradley was the fastest at the shotgun across all ages at this month's nationals in Palmerston North on the way to winning the young guns (14-16 age group) and finishing ninth overall.</p>
<p>The 14-year-old is a rising star in what is the fastest growing shooting sport in the United States and probably New Zealand.</p>
<p>Bradley got into the sport through his dad and the Wanganui Pistol Club. It was the adrenaline and the camaraderie at events which he enjoyed. The sport is as much about the mind as it is the physical and it is something Bradley has put time into, having visited a hypnotherapist for mental skills training.</p>
<p>It was about keeping calm and being positive, he said.</p>
<p>His parents say his ability to listen and take in what is required sets him apart.</p>
<p>Cowboy dress is a must for competition, as is the nickname. Bradley goes by the alias Rooster.</p>
<p>Now it's about preparing for a shot at a junior world title in New Mexico in June.</p>
<p>"I can't wait. It'll be awesome," Bradley said.</p>
<p>"He's got a really good chance," father Shaun said. "He's extremely good."</p>
<p>He's also on the lookout for sponsors to help get him there with Ross Clark The Plumber and River City Scrap Metals on board.</p>
<p>While practising as often as he can, he has also completed range officer courses which allows him to be part of the officiating crew.</p>
