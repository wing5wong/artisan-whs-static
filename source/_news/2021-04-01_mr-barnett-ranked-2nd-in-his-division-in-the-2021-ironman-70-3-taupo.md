Big congrats to Mr Barnett who competed in the 2021 IRONMAN 70.3 Taupo, with a time of 4:24:18! Mr Barnett was ranked 2nd in his Division and 9th Overall! 👏👏

This qualified him to participate in the Ironman World Champs in Utah, USA on 17-18 September this year but Josh has chosen not to go due to the current covid restrictions.

🏊‍♂️🚴‍♂️🏃‍♂️  Well done Josh!! 👍😀
