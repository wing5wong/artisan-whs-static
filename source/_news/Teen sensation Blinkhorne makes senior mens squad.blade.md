<h4><span>Whanganui teenage roller hockey sensation Jimi Blinkhorne is named in the New Zealand senior men's team to play Australia in a three test series in Queensland in May.</span></h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Globetrotting Whanganui teenager Jimi Blinkhorne has achieved yet another medium term goal after gaining selection to the New Zealand Senior Men's Roller Hockey team to play&nbsp;Australia in May.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 16-year-old Whanganui High School student has not long returned from back-to-back gold in Melbourne at the Australia Day Cup national club championships after reuniting with the Mordialloc under-17 side.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The same side, with Blinkhorne again at the wheel, won last year's title after an unbeaten run and repeated the dose again in Dandenong in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During the same tournament in January, Blinkhorne also rolled out for the Melbourne-based Mordialloc club's number three senior team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Playing in blistering hot conditions, Blinkhorne didn't miss a beat scoring in every under-17 division match to win gold.</strong></p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">However, the icing on the cake was when he was named MVP (Most Valuable Player) in the senior division.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His selection to the Kiwi senior men's side means he will be again taking on the Australians in a three test series in Gympie, Queensland in May.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>He will be in action at the Whanganui Roller Hockey Tournament over Easter Weekend.</strong></p>
