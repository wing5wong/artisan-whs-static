<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It's is a beautiful day today so we should be seeing some awesome rugby from both WHS and Linton teams.&nbsp; The boys stuck to structure and turned up an hour early to go over their warm up and game plan.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A miscommunication caused Linton to be late and the be ended up starting at 1.30pm.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>A good run from Blair Osborne with an offload to Daniel Kauika saw the first try of the season right next to the post.&nbsp; Successful conversion from Mitchell Millar Score 7-0 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Another great run from WHS saw them get the ball from one side of the field to the other for Daniel Kauika to score again in the corner.&nbsp; Conversion unsuccessful.&nbsp; Score 12-0 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Linton show they are not out of the race yet showing determination they score in the corner conversion unsuccessful Score 12-5 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Linton grind hard rumbling up the field to score again.&nbsp; Conversion successful Score 12-10 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Half time score 12-10 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Linton grind and work hard again to score next to the post.&nbsp; Conversion successful Score 17-12 Linton.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Good grind work from WHS saw Tom Gibson score in the corner.&nbsp; Conversion successful from Mitchell Millar.&nbsp; Score 19-17 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Linton grind again and score next to the post conversion unsuccessful.&nbsp; Score 22-19 Linton.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>High school show they are not out yet with an exciting try from Corbin Warren the conversion unsuccessful 24-22 WHS.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Final Score 24-22 WHS.&nbsp; The amount of hard work and determination showed by WHS was awesome.&nbsp; This week is going to be a big week for the boys with Saturday (today) being their Semi Final in the Colts grade, Wednesday they have a game against Collegiate at Collegiate at 2.30pm and the Manawatu Colts final Saturday next week.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
