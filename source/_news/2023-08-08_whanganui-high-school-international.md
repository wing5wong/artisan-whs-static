On the 8th of August we bid farewell to students from Namiki High School, Tsukuba, Japan. We are so grateful to our buddies who looked after them at school, and the [](<>)wonderful homestay families who welcomed students into their homes and gave them a taste of New Zealand life and culture.

Videos of the dance performances are posted on the Whanganui High School - International Facebook page.
