<p>FEET FIRST: Hawera High School's Tayla Collins and Wanganui High School's Philine Diekhoff tangle for the ball in the girls football game.</p>
<p>WANGANUI High School got the better of visiting Hawera High in their sports exchange on the school grounds and courts yesterday.</p>
<p>The exchange consisted of eight games across four codes, with Wanganui High School winning five and losing two, with one draw.</p>

<p>Across on the football field, the Wanganui High School Girls' team had no problems, winning 19-0, while inside the Seddon Gym the Wanganui High School Boys' basketball team were victorious 100-44.</p>
<p>However, the large score-lines were not all one-way traffic as the Hawera High School Under 15 team were big 63-5 winners.</p>
<p>In the 12pm round, the Boys' football team made a clean sweep for their code with a 5-2 win, while the Girls' basketball team, which contained some players who had already taken part in the netball, were defeated 71-61.</p>
