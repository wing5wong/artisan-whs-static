Awesome start for our WHS Learn to Row athletes yesterday at AWRC! 

And we're off! It was a great start to learn to row as they showed our coaches what they're capable of!

Our returners pitched in with tips and encouragement, and Axel had a big grin on his face which could have also been partly due to Jake setting yet another NZ record... what an afternoon!
