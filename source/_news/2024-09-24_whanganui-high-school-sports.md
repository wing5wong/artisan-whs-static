Over the weekend Year 11 student Noah Frederick attended the North Island Judo Championships, held in Auckland. With a field of tough competition in packed divisions Noah came away with silver in the Cadets (under 18s) under 73kg and bronze in the Junior Men's (under 21s) under 73kg bracket.

His hard work and dedication is certainly paying off and Noah is looking forward to competing in Queensland, Australia this weekend. 

Well done Noah and all the best for Oz!
