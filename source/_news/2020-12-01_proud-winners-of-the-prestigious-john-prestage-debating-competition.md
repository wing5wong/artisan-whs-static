**Whanganui High School Kowhai Team - Proud Winners!!**

On the first day of Summer our Kowhai team took on Fielding Agricultural High School in the finals of the prestigious John Prestage Debating Competition. 

Both teams were unbeaten, coming into the finals after four rounds of harsh competition with schools from the wider Manawatu and Whanganui regions. In total 32 teams were involved in the competition.

The teams were given 40 minutes to prepare the very difficult moot:

_This House would institute a superannuation scheme with an age of entitlement based on ethnic identification._

It was a pleasure to watch the high-level debate that showed a deep awareness of how New Zealand society can move forward towards fairness for all. I am very proud and congratulate the girls with this outstanding result. I have seen them grow from strength to ‘strongest’ and can honestly say that the future of debating at Whanganui High School is in safe hands. Hats off!!!

I would also like to thank all the Senior debaters who supported the team by adjudicating and coaching them.
