Internship Story – Taylor Barrie

Interacting with dolphins, whales and other marine animals is just another “day in the office” for Adventure Tourism Management student Taylor Barrie.

Taylor is currently on her 9 month, fully paid internship with the legendary  Bay of Islands – Fullers GreatSights 

In her role as Summer Cruise Attendant she has a range of responsibilities such as, deck hand & line handling, ticket collection and meeting and greeting guests. She also has the role of explaining and demonstrating safety briefings.

The things she enjoys the most about her job include showcasing how beautiful the islands are, meeting new people and learning about all different cultures

And her ultimate career goal? To follow her newfound passion for the seas and to start an international career working on super yachts hopefully in the Maldives or in the Mediterranean.

Finally, some words of wisdom from Taylor:

“Always do what you’re afraid to do’, start a new chapter, a new career, I promise you will love it!”

Prior to joining QRC Taylor was a student at  [Whanganui High School](https://www.facebook.com/WhanganuiHigh/).
