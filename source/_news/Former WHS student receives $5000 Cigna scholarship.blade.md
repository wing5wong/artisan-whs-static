<p class="element element-paragraph">Former Whanganui High School student Clarissa Nowak has been awarded the 2018 Cigna Actuarial Scholarship, worth $5000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nowak, 20, is currently in her third year at Victoria University of Wellington where she is completing a bachelor of science.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Cigna scholarship was advertised on the Victoria University website, so I applied for it and I got it," Nowak said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was really quite amazed because [Cigna is] obviously a big company, so for me that means a lot, not only financially, but also in terms of my future career."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Actuaries apply mathematical and statistical methods to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scholarship is intended to encourage students to consider the actuarial profession as a career path - a path that Nowak is following.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nowak did not know about the actuarial career until she had started at Victoria.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I started off with maths because I've always enjoyed it, which sounds weird, but I just didn't find it challenging enough," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then I found out about actuarial science, so I took that up and now I'm doing a double major in maths and actuarial science."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nowak said that Cigna has a really good team spirit and that she may get the opportunity to do an internship with the company.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Assessing risk is already a big factor in Nowak's life. During Summer she patrols Castlecliff and Mowhanau beaches.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm originally from Germany, we moved here in 2010, my brother found out about being a surf lifeguard and got me into it," Nowak said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've always enjoyed being in the water and around the water and I'm very confident in it, so being a surf lifeguard is ideal because that way I can also help the community."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Head of customer propositions and value at Cigna, Nathan Thomas, said he was impressed by Nowak's academic ability as an A+ student and her well-roundedness.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Apart from being an outstanding candidate academically, Clarissa showed through her community involvement that she's passionate about helping others and making a positive difference.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's a good communicator and her involvement in the community really impressed us. We think an actuarial career will be a great fit for Clarissa."</p>
