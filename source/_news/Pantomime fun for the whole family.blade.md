<p>Wanganui Repertory Theatre is bringing a traditional pantomime to Whanganui in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood, written by Roger Hall, will open at Repertory on December 9.</p>
<p>Director Colin Hedivan said the show promised all the features of a traditional English pantomime - quirky songs and dances, larger than life characters, and an "old dame" played by a man - but with a distinctly Kiwi twist.</p>
<p>"It's a lot of fun. It's aimed at children, but there's a layer of humour that only adults would get," Mr Hedivan said.</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood was one of a series of pantomimes that Roger Hall wrote.</p>
<p>"It's something a bit different for Whanganui audiences, who are not used to the traditional pantomime."</p>
<p>Mr Hedivan said Red Riding Hood had a small cast of eight, with most of those young people.</p>
<p>"My goal was to bring a more youthful element to Repertory, which I feel has been missing over the past few years," he said.</p>
<p>Choreographer Bridget Rison said being involved in the show had been a lot of fun.</p>
<p>"The themes lend themselves well to choreography, and there are lots of comic elements in them as well."</p>
<p>Ms Rison said she had aimed for variety in the dances: "Each one has a different vibe to it," she said.</p>
<p>Red Riding Hood will open at Repertory Theatre in Ridgway St on December 9 and run until December 18. There will be 2pm matinee shows in the weekends, and 6.30pm shows on week nights.</p>
<p>Tickets are $20 for adults and children $10. Bookings can be made through the Royal Wanganui Opera House, and door sales will also be available.</p>
