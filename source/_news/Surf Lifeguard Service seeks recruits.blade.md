<p>All former WHS students; Clarissa Nowak, Julian Kasner and Samantha Miller say being a life guard is the best summer job there is.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Surf Lifeguard Service wants to show you behind the scenes of the "best summer job you could have".</p>
<p>The club is holding an open day this Sunday in a bid to sign up people for this summer's patrols at Castlecliff and Kai Iwi beaches.</p>
<p>Recruits need to be at least 14 and able to swim 400m in nine minutes.</p>
<p>Wanganui Surf Lifeguard Service promotions officer Melanie Miller said the open day would be a chance for people to learn about the service and what it does.</p>
<p>"We've got a whole lot of new equipment which we want to show off as well."</p>
<p>Mrs Miller said they wanted as many people as possible signed up for the coming summer.</p>
<p>"It's a bit difficult to tell (how many we need) at the moment because a lot of them are at university and it depends who's coming back," she said.</p>
<p>"We want as many as possible because we want to offer the chance for them to go into surf comps."</p>
<p>Lifeguards begin their training next week and there was time for new recruits to be trained by December when patrols begin.</p>
<p>"For people who can swim 300m, we can get them up to 400m."</p>
<p>The current crop of lifeguards recommended joining the patrol.</p>
<p>"It's probably the best summer job you could have. It's a huge family," lifeguard Samantha Miller said.</p>
<p>Clarissa Nowak said: "you have a of responsibility but you learn a lot".</p>
<p>The open day will run from 10am to about 12pm on Sunday at the clubrooms at the bottom on Rangiora St at Castlecliff Beach.</p>
