<p><br />Two of the 12-man New Zealand roller hockey squad will carry the Whanganui flag into battle at the 2019 World Roller Games in Barcelona, Spain on July 7-13.</p>
<p>Veteran Dean Fitness and rapidly rising star <strong>Jimi Blinkhorne</strong> have been named in the list of senior men field players, while Carlon Barry, also from Whanganui, is one of two non-travelling reserves named by Roller Hockey New Zealand. The travelling players fly out on Monday.</p>
<p>The World Roller Games will feature more than 4000 athletes in action and will crown the world's best in 11 very diverse disciplines - alpine, artistic, roller freestyle, downhill, inline freestyle, inline hockey, rink hockey, roller derby, scooter, speed and skateboarding.</p>
<p>The last discipline is set to experience an extra special championship in Barcelona, given that it will also be a qualifying event for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The New Zealand roller hockey team will compete in the Rink Hockey Challenger's Championship competition in Terrassa, Spain and have drawn the men's Group A pool alongside Belgium, Chinese Taipei, Uruguay, Japan and group favourites Austria.</p>
<p>In his early 30s Fitness is a five-time veteran New Zealand player, while Blinkhorne is a three-time representative despite his tender age of 18.</p>
<p>Neither are strangers to international competition and Blinkhorne knows his way around Spain after attending a training camp in La Coruna in northwestern Spain in June, 2017.</p>
<p>The teenager immersed himself in a sport he is as passionate about as the Europeans. Blinkhorne is a rare talent in the sport and was named MVP of the Australia Day Cup tournament in Melbourne earlier this year after he and his Mordialloc team won the under-20 division of the Australian national club championships.</p>
<p>Blinkhorne made the step up to under-20 this season after being part of the Mordialloc team that won back-to-back under-17 Australia Day Cup titles in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>Blinkhorne was named MVP for the under-17s and also made his debut for Mordialloc's second senior men's team during the same tournament last year where he claimed the MVP title for that grade.</p>
<p>Being a tournament standout is nothing new for Blinkhorne.</p>
<p>The globetrotting skater achieved yet another medium-term goal after gaining selection to the New Zealand senior men's roller hockey team to play Australia in a transtasman contest in May last year. He won MVP for the under-17 division and the supreme sportsman award for all grades at that tournament in Gympie.</p>
<p>The pair know full well the World Games will be a massive step up.</p>
<p>"Our aim is to beat Japan and Chinese Taipei in our Group A competition, anything else will be a bonus," Fitness said.</p>
<p>"The Americans and many of the European sides, including Austria in our group, will field very strong teams and will be among the favourites to win the world title."</p>
<p>As a warm-up to the world competition, the New Zealand team has entered the Rink Hockey Tournoi International Blagnac in France.</p>
<p>This competition is a club side contest between HC Rega &amp; Bofe from Portugal, Spanish club sides Alpicat and Saint Celoni and hosts the Blagnac Sporting Club from France.</p>
<p>"It will be a strong warm-up competition for us," Blinkhorne said.</p>
<p>"While they are club sides it will be just like playing an international for us. They'll probably smoke us, but it's good preparation for the world contest."</p>
