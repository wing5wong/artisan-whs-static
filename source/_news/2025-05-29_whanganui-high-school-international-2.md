âœ¨Kia ora from Japan! ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

Today Whanganui High School students Jeide Tyrell, Jipsy Manuel-Joseph and Acacia Kingi-Te Koari arrived safely in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, to a very warm welcome from their host families and staff from the Hokkaido Board of Education. It was a wonderful reunion with Nami, Saki and Hanii, who visited us in Whanganui just two months ago as part of our reciprocal cultural exchange. Joining the trip are Maria Melbourne and Aurora Chernoff from Whanganui Girls' College International who also hosted students from Hokkaido in March. 

Over the next two weeks, our students will experience daily life in Japan, attend school, and deepen their understanding of Japanese culture. As part of the programme, they will also visit the Upopoy National Ainu Museum to learn more about the Indigenous culture of Hokkaido.

Weâ€™re incredibly grateful to Whanganui & Partnersfor their support in helping make this exchange possible. Programmes like this create meaningful international connections and unforgettable learning experiences for our students.
