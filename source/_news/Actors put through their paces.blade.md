<p>What a fun evening! And that was only the auditions!</p>
<p>Twenty hopefuls gathered at Repertory Theatre on Sunday, September 25, hoping to gain a part in the upcoming production of Roger Hall's&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Director Whanganui High School drama teacher Colin Hedivan</strong> put them through their paces, acting out different characters and scenarios ... an old person, a lover, a servant, a villain, a hero. The Laurel and Hardy style slapstick routine provoked a lot of laughter, spontaneous, comical and clever. These actors, ranging in age from eight years old to 50 plus, acquitted themselves well.</p>
<p>For the slapstick routine actors were given ties and hats as props and a little time to prepare their skits. A surprising number of variations on the theme resulted. All were really funny.&nbsp;<em>Old MacDonald's Farm</em>&nbsp;was chosen as the children's song for the actors to choreograph and sing to. Strong performances all round.</p>
<p>Colin Hedivan chose this style of auditioning for&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;to see how well the actors worked together. How did they look together? Do they complement each other?<br />Even those familiar with 'treading the boards' often find the prospect of singing solo rather daunting but Sunday's aspiring thespians were unfazed and confidently sang their chosen numbers, even little eight-year-old Elizabeth Hurley.</p>
<p>From the 20 applicants Colin has chosen a strong cast of eight, most of whom are experienced on stage despite their youth. Their youth is a real plus for Repertory, demonstrating that live theatre still has a future in Wanganui. Four of the new cast are under 20 years of age!</p>
<p>Young <strong>Konrad Shaw</strong> (WHS student), in his first year at secondary school has already appeared in a Repertory production, last year's&nbsp;<em>The Doll's House</em>, and <strong>Brylee Noble</strong> <span>(WHS student)</span>&nbsp;appeared in<em>Macbeth</em>&nbsp;at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong>These two youngsters will play the parts of Boris and Morris. <br />Millie Manning (WHS student)&nbsp;has been cast as Little Red Riding Hood</strong> and Lauren Karl is to play the part of the wolf.</p>
<p>Bridget Hurley, who recently appeared in Repertory's&nbsp;<em>One Act Plays</em>, will play the part of Little Red's mother while Chris McKenzie will play Grandma. Another drama teacher is in the cast; Paul Collins is the evil Sir Roger Bounder while Bj&ouml;rn Walczak (former WHS student) is Lance, the man from DoC.</p>
<p>Colin Hedivan has selected a talented and experienced cast for a show that promises to be high energy, and above all, fun.<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;will be playing at Repertory Theatre from December 9-18.</p>
