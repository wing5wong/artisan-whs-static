WHS Performing Arts hit the boards again in the weekend.

WHS represented at the University of Otago Sheilah Winn Shakespeare Festival held at Feilding High School on Sunday 11 April.  This was the Whanganui / Manawatu Regional Festival celebrating the works of the Bard.

Congratulations to our 10 actors for entering and performing excerpts from Shakespeare’s plays in the festival. 

The three plays performed were:  
‘The Tempest’ - Toni Adams, Maddy McKenzie, Firooze Colaabavala and Kezia Pickering.  
'As You Like It’ - Toni Adams and Maddy McKenzie.  
‘The Taming Of The Shrew’ - Ela Robbins, Firooze Colaabavala, Max Hughes, Autumn Lilley, Nadeem Wali, Laila Belkouadssi and Godfavour Akinyele.  
They were 5 minute, self-directed and GO!

We are particularly proud of your efforts as directors.  You demonstrated our LIFE values through your self-management and determination to be part of this fabulous event.
You are a credit to the school!

Thank you to our local king of theatre, Mr Chris McKenzie, for kick-starting the Festival team.

We are all looking forward to being part of the Festival next year.

Teacher in charge*
