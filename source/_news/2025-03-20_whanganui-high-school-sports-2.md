The last two Ross Taylor Bat campaigns have brought tremendous success.  2023 and 2024 saw Whanganui High School win by the barest of margins, and they are hoping to make it a three-peat for the first time in the competitions history this year.   The team will be led by Ryan Meredith for the second time, who will captain a young developing team.  Unfortunately, the team will be without Central District U17 representative Aidan Muir who is sidelined with an injury.  Steve Meredith returns to coach the side for the 5th time this year, hoping to add to his collection of WHS accolades.

The team head away next week in Summer Tournament Week to play the competition. 

All the best team!
