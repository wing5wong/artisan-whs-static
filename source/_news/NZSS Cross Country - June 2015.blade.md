<p><span>NZSS Cross Country was held in Dunedin on Saturday 20 June 2015. &nbsp;WHS students Emma Rainey, Rebecca Baker, Sam Luff and Travis Bayler were lucky to get home after the flooding in the Wanganui region.</span></p>
<p><span>WHS had 4 competitors go down to Dunedin over the weekend to represent the school at the NZSS Cross Country Champs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Rebecca Baker got 22nd in a competitive race of 87. Travis Bayler came in 134th&nbsp;and Sam Luff 122nd in&nbsp;a huge&nbsp;race of over 140 Year 9 boys. Emma Rainey who competed in the Senior girls race came 52nd out of 138 girls.</span></p>
<p><span>The 4 students enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to training hard to become&nbsp;more competitive in the 2016 champs. &nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The exciting part of their trip would of been getting back to Wanganui because of the floods. We had to divert to Dannevirke for an extra night stay then got as far as Turakina on Sunday to be told we will be there until Tuesday with all access to Wanganui out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But then we got a phone call from Steve Rainey to say he has a helicopter coming to pick us up and bring us back to Wanganui. A real amazing end to the trip seeing a 'birds eye view' of the floods in and around Wanganui.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A big thank&nbsp;you to the Rainey family!&nbsp;</span></p>
