<p>While a few players have solid representative experience, it will be a new level for the Netball Wanganui senior team announced today to prepare for the 2015 Lion Foundation Netball Championships.</p>
<p>Coach Lisa Murphy finalised her squad of 12 from the 21 players invited to trial on Thursday evening.</p>
<p><span>Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School, have had Renee Butler and Sammy Murphy chosen and t</span>hree members of Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau have made the cut, Rachael Lynch, Suzanne Guilford and Kelera Kuruyabaki who was a former WHS player last year.</p>
<p>Lynch has arguably the most comparative experience, having played a season in the Western Zone team before Netball NZ decided this year to change back from regional representative squads to the old provincial format for the first time since 2000.</p>
<p>Butler and Murphy have played regional tournaments at Under-19 level. They, alongside Kuruyabaki and Victoria Anstis, were in the wider 2013 Wanganui Under-17 squad, the final team of which finished an extremely impressive fourth at the New Zealand Age Group Championships.</p>
<p>"For the rest, this is definitely the biggest thing for them," said Lisa Murphy.</p>
<p>"If you look at that Wellington team, there's Silver Ferns all around us."</p>
<p>It means the likes of Kuruyabaki could find herself marking the living legend Irene van Dyk in the Wellington team, which Murphy is convinced will happen.</p>
<p>"She will be marking Van Dyk. It will be good for them.</p>
<p>"There is depth right through and versatility in all areas.</p>
<p>"I feel we have chosen the best 12 and a team that can combine together in a short time," said the coach.</p>
<p>The team have their first training at the WHS gym on Wednesday from 6pm-7.30pm.</p>
<p>They have entered another pre-nationals tournament in Palmerston North on September 6, to be followed by the second in Wellington on September 12.</p>
<p>Then it will be the big one - the netball championships at the ASB Sport Centre in Wellington, September 28 to October 2.</p>
