<h4 class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Kyle Lawson, originally from Whanganui, is one of the world's top cornet soloists and he is back home for one very special concert this Sunday.</strong></h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lawson's playing has taken him to many great bands including Wellington Brass, The New Zealand Army Band, Woolston Brass, and Brighouse and Rastrick in the UK.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He picked up the cornet when he joined Brass Whanganui as an 11-year-old and it seems he has never looked back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was never interested in playing another instrument," he says. "I didn't have any family members who played with Brass Whanganui but I discovered that my great-grandfather played with the garrison band."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lawson will play four feature pieces at the Sunday concert - cornet solos&nbsp;<em>Life's Pageant&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Don't Doubt Him Now</em>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Macushla</em>&nbsp;with piano accompaniment.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Band leader Bruce Jellyman said it will be wonderful to have Lawson's "incredible cornet artistry" as part of the concert.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He will be working with other band members - giving some individual lessons, and leading section practices."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Lawson also found time to head back to Whanganui High School where he went to school and work with some students there.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Sunday concert will begin with Peter Graham's&nbsp;<em>Academic Festival Fanfare</em>&nbsp;which features antiphonal sounds from cornets on the left and trombones to the left.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bruce Jellyman said the larger work for this programme is a set of period pieces, featuring music from the Elizabethan Court.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These pieces sound best in a church building with the acoustic of Christ Church.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The&nbsp;<em>Seal Lullaby</em>&nbsp;by Eric Whitacre originally written for choir and beautifully crafted for brass band by Alan Fernie.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was originally a movie score to the Kipling story&nbsp;<em>The White Seal</em>. It is beautiful, tender and simple."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will be a cornet quartet&nbsp;<em>Fidgety Feet</em>&nbsp;and the melancholy&nbsp;<em>Mid All the Traffic</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The programme will conclude with some true brass band fun by Paul Lovatt-Cooper," said Jellyman. "You've been warned - big swing, big brass band sounds."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brass Whanganui with Kyle Lawson at Christ Church, 243 Wicksteed Street, Sunday, Feb 25, at 2pm. Cash sale tickets at the door $25 Adults, $20 seniors and children 16 and under are free.</strong></p>
