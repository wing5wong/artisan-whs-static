<p><span>Great day at Hutt Valley High School today (Wednesday 14 June) for our sports exchange. </span>Weather held off for us.</p>
<p><span>Not the full results we would of liked but winners of the boys and girls hockey and A1 netball! Some great games were played by all. </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to all of our coaches, managers, parents for their support. <br />And a BIG thank you to our students for representing the school well.</span></p>
