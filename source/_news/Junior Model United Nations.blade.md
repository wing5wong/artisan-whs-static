<p dir="ltr"><span>On Wednesday 9</span><span>&nbsp;November WHS sent 8 teams to take part in the Annual Wanganui Junior Model United Nations day at Girls&rsquo; College. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our students represented Chile, Denmark, France, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey and Vietnam. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The aim of the day was to get the &lsquo;countries&rsquo; debating and discussing important issues, and this year the students tackled the threat posed by the Zika Virus and also what should be done about the Refugee Crisis. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students dressed up, brought food and debated and lobbied with other students representing other countries. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To start the proceedings each team had to present a brief speech about their country, and in this way, the students learnt a great deal about other countries and cultures. Our students acquitted themselves so well. They were thoroughly prepared, and their arguments showed measured thought and a sensible pragmatism, many recognising the need for more developed countries to help those less fortunate. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>If these young people grow up to be real politicians, then the future of the world is safe in their hands! </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Congratulations TURKEY which included Leah Alono, Callista Booth-Richards and Katja Mokha who were awarded BEST DELEGATION and also BEST DRESSED. A special mention must go to VIETNAM represented by Ben Power, Ali Gammeter and Nanea Schurhammer, who received a SPECIAL MERIT CERTIFICATE for Overall effort having placed in most categories.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>This year, because of the lateness of the event in the school calendar, there were no seniors to assist, and so special thanks must go to the three Y10 girls: Hunter Flanagan-Connors, Rhiannon Free and Elyana Gifford who were extremely capable assistants.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>A great day, well done to all the Y9 and Y10 students who prepared so well for the event.</span></p>
