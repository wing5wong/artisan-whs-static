<p class="element element-paragraph">Every year local artists produce a stunning array of works to enter in the Whanganui Arts Review and the time for 2019 submissions is almost here.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Submissions will be received at the Sarjeant Gallery on February 26 and this year will see some exciting changes to the 30-year-old competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wellington consultancy company patillo has become the principal sponsor for the Arts Review which now offers a $5000 (previously $2000) prize to the winner of the Open Award as well as a solo artist exhibition at the Sarjeant the following year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Patillo founder and co-director Anne Patillo says she did not give an immediate "yes" answer when approached by Sarjeant Gallery director Greg Anderson.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wanted our contribution to be more than just a financial one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was very impressed with the way the Sarjeant team went away and worked out how they could offer something more to an artist."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sarjeant curators will mentor the winning artist to bring their exhibition together.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her company has already contributed to the Sarjeant Gallery redevelopment project and patillo says it is a privilege to be part of something so significant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Sarjeant Gallery turns 100 this year and patillo says there are good reasons for its longevity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You don't get to be 100 without doing something right and the Sarjeant has great standing both nationally and internationally."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The philanthropist says she has no connection to Whanganui other than a long-standing love for the Sarjeant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My partner and I stopped off in Whanganui while taking a holiday along the west coast years ago and I fell in love with the gallery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The building and the aspect looked wonderful and inside was a treasure trove."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, the Open Award becomes the patillo project and there are still 10 other categories with Whanganui sponsors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Anne Patillo says it is a privilege to sit alongside those sponsors and she praises their long-term commitment to the awards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another new sponsor this year is Dalgleish Architects of Whanganui who will sponsor a second Excellence Award worth $1000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Elva Abbott has been submitting her paintings to the Arts Review since it began and says the awards have been wonderfully affirming for her.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With no formal training, she took up painting at age 42 and developed her ability to paint local landscapes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think creating art is the most irritating pleasure a person can have," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now 92, she still loves to paint and will be submitting one of her works this year.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Sculptor Glen Hayward does have an arts degree but says he loves the openness of the Arts Review.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a great leveller," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It gives artists a sense of belonging to the community and feeling like you're part of a group because our work is solitary."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mikayla Baldwin, at 18 will be submitting her work for the third time this year and says she loves the inclusiveness of the awards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It provides a fantastic opportunity for young people. Everyone can enter and youth and inexperience don't matter."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baldwin was the inaugural winner of the Fine Arts Whanganui Young Artist Scholarship in 2017 and says it would be wonderful to add an Arts Review prize to her resume.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youngest Arts Review winner in 2018 was 12-year-old Oscar Toy who won the Renata's Art &amp; Framing Merit Award for his pen on paper drawing.</p>
