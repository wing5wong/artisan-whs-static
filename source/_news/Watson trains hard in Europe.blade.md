<p class="element element-paragraph">Despite sustaining an injury in Germany, training in Holland is paying dividends for Whanganui judoka Keightley Watson.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Competing over the weekend in The Bremen Master Open in Germany, the 16-year-old had a strong start with a win first up but took a knock to his fibula bone on his leg.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He continued on into the next fight and was leading on points, but further knocks to the area meant that he could not continue in the fight and subsequently withdrew from the competition to get x-rays on the damage done. They revealed a hairline crack of the fibula.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While disappointed in having to withdraw from the competition, he was happy with his fighting and said he was confident of a podium finish at the tournament.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In fact, the German fighter in the second fight actually went on to win tournament," father Ross Watson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Managing these injuries in the future are something he will just need to work on especially when fighting in the tougher European tournaments with the higher level of the competitors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Despite his injury his training in Holland is paying dividends in the long term, Watson senior said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Training consists of a solid six days a week of judo, that also includes one night a week at their regional training camp and he also had an invitation to attend their national training camp.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In conjunction with his mat training, he spends 2-3 hours daily in the gym, so his conditioning, strength and fitness is the best it has ever been.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He will now be fighting time to be ready for the Oceania Judo Champs in New Caledonia next week (April 6-8), but we will get him assessed in New Zealand when he arrives back on Friday from The Netherlands.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But he will not risk any further damage at this tournament as he has more overseas competitions coming up this year including a return to the Netherlands," Watson said.</p>
