<p><span>Brass Whanganui will present an afternoon of movie magic on Sunday.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brass Whanganui will present their Sounds of Cinema concert at Wanganui Collegiate's Prince Edward Auditorium tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Band leader Bruce Jellyman says it will be a great programme and he confesses to having a personal favourite -&nbsp;<em>Florentiner March</em>&nbsp;from the 1996 comedy drama&nbsp;<em>Brassed Off</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have really enjoyed preparing this programme, being lighter than our brass band programmes and for the pure breadth of style and sounds."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another highlight will be the&nbsp;<em>Love Theme</em>&nbsp;by Ennio Morricone from the 1998 Italian film&nbsp;<em>Cinema Paradiso</em>&nbsp;with a special guest appearance by cellist Annie Hunt.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Annie is from Whanganui but she has been living in England for a long time so we are very privileged to have her home to play with us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brass Whanganui's own soloist, former WHS student Jacob Mancer, will pay Eflat horn on&nbsp;<em>Somewhere Over The Rainbow</em>&nbsp;and Chris Scudders will play his soft, smooth trombone on Charlie Chaplin's&nbsp;<em>Smile</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Classic movie themes from Disney, Harry Potter,&nbsp;<em>Saving Private Ryan</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;are also included in the programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Most big movie music is very brass and percussion sounding so works really well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are having fun with this music and we hope the audience will have fun too."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Jellyman says it has been a good year for Brass Whanganui with a first equal placing at the provincial band contest in New Plymouth and a first placing in the Street March with drum major Gordon Ririnui showing his excellence in front of this very good band.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band leader can be forgiven for being particularly proud of trombone player Hamish Jellyman winning best soloist trophy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui Brass, Sounds of Cinema concert: Cinematic music from the slap-stick of Charlie Chaplin to today's Hunger Games theme. Prince Edward Auditorium, Wanganui Collegiate School, 2pm Sunday, October 29, door sales only.</strong></p>
