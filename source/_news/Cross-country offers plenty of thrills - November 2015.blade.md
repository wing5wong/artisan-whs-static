<p><span>CRASHED OUT: Wanganui's <strong>Olly Dennison</strong> (WHS student) was right in the hunt in the J90 near Taupo at the weekend until braking his kick-start after crashing.</span></p>
<p>WANGANUI junior Riki Wainhouse staged a final lap comeback to claim second in the 90-minute cross-country motorcycle race near Taupo at the weekend.</p>
<p>With each lap taking around 24 minutes to complete, Wainhouse was running fourth with just one lap to go in the 11-12 year race. In a nail-biting finish the youngster left it until the final corner before mounting his challenge to take the runner-up spot. Wainhouse was one of around 20 Wanganui Motorcycle Club members to race at the Taupo event which also included the Epic 4-Hour Cross Country for the older riders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Olly Dennison</strong> was again in outstanding form running second for most of the 13-14 Year race until he had a small crash and lost his kick-start and could not finish the race. James Rountree (KX85) finished 19th after stopping to see if his mate Olly needed help.</p>
<p>In the 15-16 year class former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Joe Wainhouse</strong> (YZF250) ended up 13th and Hunter Gilbertson (YZF250) 21st.</p>
<p>In the 4-Hour race top Wanganui riders Seamus Manson (YZF250) and <span>former WHS student&nbsp;</span><strong>Joel Daniels</strong> (RMZ450) finished ninth overall in the elite big bore class and were 11th out of the 160 plus riders in that class. F<span>ormer WHS student&nbsp;</span><strong>Seth Reardon</strong> (KTM350) and Scott Russell (RMZ450) finished 18th and Roger Bland (RMZ450) and Jason Wakeling (YZF450) 30th.</p>
<p>In the vets 80+ class (combined age over 80 years) Ant Rountree (KXF450) and Colin Matthews (YZF250) finished fifth, Dwayne Bishop (RMZ450) and Dave Dennison (CRFf450) 13th and Peter Duxfield (YZF250) and Wilson Woods (YZF250) 14th.</p>
<p>In the father and son team class Shayne Wainhouse (CRF450) <strong>Joe Wainhouse</strong> (YZF250) finished fourth, only one second adrift of third place. Paul (KXF450) and Jordan (CRF250) Hatch were 10th.</p>
