<p><span>Jimi Blinkhorne (left) and Aussie mate Ash Clee shared the experience of a month-long roller hockey training camp in Spain.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jimi Blinkhorne can't get enough and is already planning a trip back to Spain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 16-year-old Whanganui High School student has only just returned home from a month-long roller hockey training camp in La Coruna in northwestern Spain.The teenager immersed himself in a sport he is as passionate about as the Europeans.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Blinkhorne is already an old hand at travelling having tripped across the Tasman numerous times to play for New Zealand and for Melbourne club side Mordiallic when they won the national under17 Australia Day age group club title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was on this trip Blinkhorne and Mordiallic under-17 captain and good mate Ash Clee hatched a plan to attend the training camp in Spain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was (the trip) amazing," Blinkhorne said.<br />"We trained three or four hours every day, but I've got a long way to go to catch up with these guys. I would rate their under-15 teams the equal or better than our senior men's sides in New Zealand."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Blinkhorne should know - he currently plays for the Wanganui Roller Hockey Club' senior men and played in a composite men's team in a practice match against an Australian premier men's team earlier this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The game is a lot faster over there and far more intense - it's completely different to here or Australia. My host family in La Coruna was fantastic and made me feel really welcome. We were a little bit out of town, probably about 15 minutes, while Ash was staying in town.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My host family were a husband and wife who have a two-year-old child. The father, Josep , works for the Spanish Roller Hockey Federation and club side GDM in La Coruna.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"One of the main highlights was when Josep took us to Barcelona to watch some top rep games. These players were outstanding."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At times the teenager felt like an alien, but only because of the language barrier.<br />"It wasn't too bad really. Everyone speaks a little bit of english, although the older people aren't as good as the younger ones."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not long after arriving Blinkhorne and his Aussie mate were interviewed and photographed by the local newspaper. To this day he still no idea what was written or what he was quoted saying.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't talk too much, I let Ash do the talking."<br />Blinkhorne is now hooked and is keen to make a return trip.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I want to go back next year and I'll pay for this one," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This latest trip was funded mainly by his father Paul (Blink) Blinkhorne, several generous sponsors and a small grant from the Mitre 10 MEGA Wanganui Future Champions Trust.<br />In the meantime, young Blinkhorne will prepare for a club tournament hosted by his own Wanganui club on July 20 featuring teams from around the lower North Island.</p>
