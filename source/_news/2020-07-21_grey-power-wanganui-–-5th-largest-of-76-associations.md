Grey Power Wanganui has the fifth largest number of members out of the 76 associations throughout the country. Current President, Graham Adams, told the members at their recent AGM that, “Currently we have 1805 members in spite of deleting 217 in November. We lead the field in encouraging younger people raising families to join us and thereby enjoy the real benefits of cheaper power from GPE.”

Graham pointed out that the year has had its downsides with President, Lance Patterson, having to relinquish the position due to ill health and the untimely passing of committee member, Neville Proctor. Graham agreed to return as President.

He said, “The most significant event of the year for Grey Power locally was the opening of our office in Club Metro premises. A good working relationship with the club management is in place.” A Club Metro board member, **Helen Tilley** (former WHS staff member), has also joined the Grey Power committee.
