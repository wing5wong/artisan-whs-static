Our Whanganui High School Valentine’s Day was held on Friday 12 February, as our first official Social Prefect event of 2021! We had 18 prefects all dressed up as beautiful pink angels to deliver dessert items to their recipients during period one on the day. These items could have been ordered for your valentine a week in advance, with the option of a cookie (made by the talented @lazelstiersofjoy) or a big slice of red velvet cake, for a loved one, a friend, or even your favorite teacher! The day was then completed with an open mic organised by our wonderful Cultural Prefect team, filled with solo’s, duo’s, group’s, and many different musical instruments! Multiple photo boards were floating around the crowd, where students and teachers could snap a few shots to remember the day. 

Many hard hours of work and planning were put into making this day a success, right down to the last pink tutu. We could not thank everyone enough who contributed to this event, and for all of the support we received. This especially includes Kate Regan, one of our amazing student photographers, for taking most of these photos!

Again, many many thanks,
