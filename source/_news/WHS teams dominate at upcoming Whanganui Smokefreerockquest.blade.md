<p><span><strong>Whanganui High School bands dominate the upcoming SMOKEFREEROCKQUEST 2018 regional finals on Saturday, June 9 at the Opera House with 13 of the 19 bands.</strong> The other bands come from Rangitikei, Ruapehu College and Taumarunui High School.</span></p>
<p><span>Smokefreerockquest founder and director, Glenn Common, says Smokefreerockquest offers the entrants on Friday night a platform for live performance that build</span><span class="text_exposed_show">s on what they have learnt at school.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">He said the professional performance environment offered by SFRQ included a stage set up with lights, sound, projection and technical support in a show that includes a guest band, MC and lots of giveaways.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Another SFRQ founder and director, Pete Rainey, said in regional cities the Smokefreerockquest final is often the year&rsquo;s biggest youth gig and &lsquo;a major influencer&rsquo;.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really proud that our association with Smokefree has been part of a huge social change in New Zealand over the past 28 years. It&rsquo;s absolutely a real thing that the number of young kids smoking has dropped and we&rsquo;re right behind the idea of making NZ Smokefree by 2025.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>The Whanganui High School bands are- 3 dollar man, 3 White Guys and Caleb, Fuschia, Bandboozled, Ciper, Ferns, In Business, Pakalagisasa's, Pantheon, Spicy, The Remnant, The Zodiacs and Wangaz State Of Mind.&nbsp;</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The music starts at 7pm. Tickets are $10 for school students and $15 for adults from the venue or at the door. The guest band is Palmerston North SFRQ veterans, Soda Boyz, a noise punk trio, with a self-confessed 'DIY kind of sound'.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Whanganui&rsquo;s top two solo/duos and top two bands will be selected to submit footage for selection to play at the Smokefreerockquest national final on Saturday, September 22 at Auckland Girls&rsquo; Grammar. The live events run from May 5 until July 6, and most regions will also be filmed for the hugely popular webisodes (<a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsfrq.nz%2Fvideo%2F&amp;h=AT3TFR4KGCfrE78zkF4JV3aMV_2SvEjQME1f2D68gY3W-_LcPv04KI7ZCJi4d7wwHme3G1VmNF1H0rRaC465GLxYm7VY-ZeuLrN6EUOeVvcZyhRBd1b3DPnepdq-KnM1k3DrR08NpxZGGJqIyHV34k8j" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="asynclazy">sfrq.nz/video/</a>) fronted this year by NZ&rsquo;s &lsquo;First Bloke&rsquo; Clarke Gayford.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
