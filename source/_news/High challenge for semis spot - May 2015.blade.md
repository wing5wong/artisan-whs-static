<p>After two narrow losses in the opening games of the Manawatu colts club competition, the Wanganui High School 1st XV have climbed into touching distance of the top four.</p>
<p>With three wins from five, they sit two points outside the semis spots. The season began with tight losses to Linton and Massey White before a win over Kia Toa by default. Since then, they have gone on a scoring spree, hammering Feilding Colts 75-7 and Massey Blue 27-0.</p>
<p>Apart from the Manawatu colts competition, the team are gearing up for a crack at the National 1st XV championship. They will face the second-ranked Wellington school for the right to play the top Super 8 side from the Hurricanes region.</p>
<p>"It gives us the chance to play some decent rugby sides," director of rugby and deputy principal Chris Friedel said.</p>
<p>A finals appearance was the goal.</p>
<p>"We play with a lot of structure but, sometimes, when we play a lot of the school teams, there's a tendency to lose that."</p>
<p>Friedel said he had put several names forward for the Hurricanes' under-18 squad.</p>
<p>WHS take a break from club competition this weekend and play a friendly against Massey White at home.</p>
<p>They also have the derby against Wanganui Collegiate on July 29, as well as inter-school matches against Hutt Valley High and a touring English side in August.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cullinane College and Wanganui City College 1st XVs have qualified for the Manawatu secondary schools premier grade.</p>
<p>City College kick off the season proper against Manukura 1st XV at home this weekend while Cullinane are away to Dannevirke High 1st XV.</p>
<p>City College also come up against Wanganui Collegiate in an inter-school match next Wednesday.</p>
