Whanganui City College
We have had a really busy term three, jamming in all of the sports like the rest of the country. We have made it a goal to appreciate every single game or competition we have the opportunity to be part of.

We realise how fortunate we are compared to the rest of the world. Part of being in a team at WCC is that students have to attend school for over 85 per cent of the year to date. This helps our school whanau to make sure that learning and sport are both really important.

We have four netball teams this season, one more than last year, and all of the teams have worked hard to have fun and play good netball. We are also really grateful to the parents and teachers who have supported us by coaching, managing and umpiring. Our junior team has been very ably coached by our deputy head girl, Ani Latus. Hockey is another sport in which we have more players than in previous years. This meant that we were able to have a social seven-a-side team, and an 11-a-side mixed team in the secondary school grade. We would really like to mihi to all of the support we have had from Hockey Whanganui in the form of sticks, shoes and coaching time. Mr Pui has discovered he knows more than he thought.

This team will be even better next year.

WCC basketball teams continue to do very well. Our junior boys have had one loss so far under the guidance of another student, Layton Comp and Staff Pene. Our seniors are developing thanks to Stacy who has come on-board to coach.

Our dance crews have won both the NZ Secondary Schools and the DanceNZmade regionals and head off to the respective nationals in the middle of the month. The junior crew is an exciting group of students who are awesomely supported by the senior dances. We are lucky enough to have been able to invite Sheldon Rua, a nationally well-known dancer and poet to come and take our students for dance workshops in the upcoming holidays.

Inter-house competitions have been running during lunchtimes, and have been really exciting. Students have competed in table tennis, volleyball and dodge ball. Our junior students participate in Korikori to end the day twice a week. They are offered a whole variety of movement activities where the goal is to keep active. We offer activities ranging from biking and walking to circuits, skating, accuracy games, table tennis, aerobics and dance. We would also like to say a huge congratulations to Tawai Pinnock for placing in the Whanganui secondary schools crosscountry, and Paiki Johnson-Rio for placing in his year group in the secondary schools mountain biking.

WCC rugby round-up

We began the season with the hope of fielding a 1st XV this year but unfortunately we couldn't get the numbers required. However, with the permission from Justin Harper, principal of Cullinane College, we were able to get four of our senior boys to play for their 1st XV. These seniors were Atriane Marino, Majre Apiata Cook, Mythias Cook and Manihera Ngataierua. All played well and had very good seasons with Cullinane, playing WHS in the final at Cooks Gardens. Cullinane ran out close winners and took out their division of the competitive Manawatu competition. My thanks to Justin and the Cullinane College coaching staff for allowing our boys to continue playing rugby.

Girls' rugby

Our girls are in the development stage with a lot of last year's players moving on. We have a new coach Duane Heke and his knowledge and attitude to the game is rubbing off on a virtually new team. Duane is building a great culture among the girls and his eye is to rebuild for the future. I would like to thank Duane and his management team, Gemma Anderson and Paula Hawira, Nga mihi atu kia koutou, mo to manaaki ki nga wahine toa o te kura. He has a senior leadership team made up of the senior experienced girls who are doing a great job. They are, Bryleigh Martini-Rerekura, River-Jade Love-Anderson, Tui Letele and Anika Robinson. The girls have enjoyed their rugby this season and are rebuilding very well. Kia kaha Wahine Toa.

Under-15 rugby

To begin with, thanks must go to the father-and-daughter coaching team of Steve and Amber McKee. The season would not have been the success it was if it wasn't for your time and patience and the huge amount of work you have done with these young men. We are blessed to have whānau like you who are the positive mentors these boys need. Nga mihi nunui kia korua. The result has been an unbeaten run of wins culminating in a great final win against WHS U15.

To Jayden Lower and your team, thank you for the way you have all committed yourselves to each other, your coaches, and whānau. The future looks bright, with some players to follow in the footsteps of Waisake Naholo, Jona Nareki and Andy Haden, all esteemed old boys of our school.

Finally I want to thank all of our whānau for their support of our young men and women in a very disruptive sporting year. Your commitment to ensuring your son/daughter/moko is fit and prepared to play is appreciated.
