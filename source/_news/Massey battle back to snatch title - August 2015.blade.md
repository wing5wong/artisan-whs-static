<p><span>FALTERED: The Wanganui High School lads stumbled at the final hurdle when finishing runners-up in the McDonald's Manawatu Colts competition in Palmerston North at the weekend.</span></p>
<p>After a nervous start, the Wanganui High School 1st XV led for most of the final of the McDonald's Manawatu Colts competition before succumbing to Massey White 24-19 in Palmerston North at the weekend.</p>
<p>WHS have competed in the tough under-21 competition for three years now and while disappointed not to win outright, the team felt no shame in being runner-up this season, according to deputy principal Chris Friedel.</p>
<p>The other two years WHS have finished fourth.</p>
<p>In her weekly rugby newsletter to parents, WHS supporter Stacey Ranginui said the lads showed a few nerves early in the match allowing Massey to capitalise and score in the corner. The conversion was unsuccessful, but the home side were up 5-0.</p>
<p>WHS then shrugged off the nerves and Sheldon Pakinga intercepted the ball to score under the posts, making for an easy conversion by Mitchell Millar.</p>
<p>A penalty against Massey gave WHS an opportunity at goal which they missed. Massey then showed a bit of pace and scored in the corner to narrow the margin to 10-7.</p>
<p>A subsequent Massey penalty in front of the sticks gifted them a 13-7 lead.</p>
<p>However, that was short-lived when Pakinga scored in the corner and Harerangi Meihana made the conversion - the score 14-13 WHS's way.</p>
<p>A runaway try from Daniel Kauika stretched the WHS lead to 19-13 at half-time. A penalty against WHS was kicked by Massey to narrow the margin again to 19-16.</p>
<p>A big battle commenced when Massey attacked and WHS defended for about 10 minutes. Massey finally scored in the corner to give them a 21-19 lead which was extended to 24-19, after a last minute penalty was awarded to Massey.</p>
<p>"It was a great battle and it didn't come easy for Massey, they did have to work for it. Well done to the WHS team for stepping up to the under-21 colts grade - we are all very proud of each and everyone of you," Ranginui said in her newsletter.</p>
