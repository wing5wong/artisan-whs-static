<p>Whanganui's own Akira (AK) Marsters (former WHS student) got some court time for the HoopNation New Zealand Selection against Malaysia on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A slow start cost Malaysia as they went down to a HoopNation New Zealand Selection in Whanganui on Tuesday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But the visitors steadily improved throughout the game and edged the second half on the way to a 93-76 loss at Springvale Stadium.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the third game of Malaysia's six-match North Island tour and first of three matches against the HoopNation Selection.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In front of a near full stadium, the HoopNation Selection, made up of ex-Tall Blacks and NBL regulars, shot out an early lead with an initial 13-point run which the visitor's were never able to haul back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealanders were too strong in the key with Malaysia - ranked 67th in the world - regularly muscled off the ball while prone to giving away free throws at the other end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Malaysian coach swapped out his whole on-court team midway through the first quarter which ended 28-13 to the New Zealanders.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However following the quarter break Malaysia, came out much more aggressively, found their range and earned parity on the court.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With the scores 50-32 at halftime, Malaysia went on to win the second half 44-43 but that first quarter deficit proved decisive.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Everard Bartlett (22), Ana Huku (17) and Kareem Johnson (12) were the top scorers for the HoopNation Selection.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For Malaysia standout Perry Lim shot 16 points followed by Kuek Tian Yuan (10) and Li Wei Chee (9).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tour is jointly run by basketball promoter HoopNation and the Malaysian Basketball Association.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Malaysia won their first two games against under-23 sides in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They played the HoopNation Selection again in Hawera on Wednesday night before heading to New Plymouth to play the Taranaki Mountainairs on Thursday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The third HoopNation New Zealand Selection match and final game on the tour is in Tauranga on Saturday.</p>
