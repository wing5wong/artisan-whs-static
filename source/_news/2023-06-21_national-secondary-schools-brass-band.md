Four of our students has been accepted into the NSSBB or the NSSBB Development Band. Connor Rooke (Year 11) Repiano Cornet, Mitchell Cosford (Year 10) 2nd Cornet, Toby Clark (Year 12) 2nd Baritone, Bryn Morgan (Year 11) Principal Trombone. Students will meet in early October 2023 and stay at St Peter's School, Cambridge for the duration of the NSSBB band camp. All 74 students auditioned for their seat playing brass or percussion instruments. They were chosen for their sound quality, technical skills, dynamic control etc. Our Musical Directors Vickie van Uden and Reuben Brown had a very difficult job to sort so many students into the two bands, and please let it be known, not everyone who auditioned was placed into a band. These two bands are of very high quality and to be selected for these national representative bands is a privilege.
