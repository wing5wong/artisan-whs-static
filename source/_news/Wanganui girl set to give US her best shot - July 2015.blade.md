<p>HELLO AMERICA: Former WHS student&nbsp;Amber-Rose Thompson-Newth sneaks in a bit of practice at Castlecliff before starting a US golf and study scholarship</p>
<p>AMBER-ROSE Thompson-Newth is a tad nervous, but wildly excited about the adventure she is about to embark on.</p>
<p>The outstanding 19-year-old Wanganui golfer has accepted a scholarship to Post University in Waterbury, Connecticut, in the United States, and leaves next month, just a week after turning 20.</p>
<p>This year, the Castlecliff Golf Club member and Manawatu-Wanganui representative received offers from Post University and Sterling College in Kansas to join their programmes.</p>
<p>Keen to expand her horizons, Thompson-Newth had been told by NZ Golf about an Australian company which approached American schools on their clients' behalf to arrange scholarships.</p>
<p>"They came over and we had a trial day to play golf and see who did well, then there was an interview," Thompson-Newth said.</p>
<p>Accepted by the Aussie group, they secured the two university offers and Thompson-Newth had about a month to do her research and make her choice. The US school year starts in August and she also had to decide which academic degree she would pursue.</p>
<p>"I chose the one in Connecticut - it was the better university for golf,' she said yesterday. "Post University is division two, while the other was division three in golfing terms."</p>
<p>Thompson-Newth, on a 0.6 handicap, said she had done little else but train and play golf since leaving Wanganui High School in 2013 and conceded she would "probably need retraining" to get back into study mode.</p>
<p>Her schedule will revolve around study and golf practice during the week, then playing in tournaments under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) banner at weekends.</p>
<p>"I have decided to study psychology. It really interests me and mental attitude is such a huge thing in sport psyche. My scholarship is unfortunately not a full scholarship, so the rest will come from dad," she said with pride.</p>
<p>Thompson-Newth has only been offshore to Australia and concedes it will be tough to say goodbye to parents Lydia Newth and Paul Thompson and sister Jade, 17.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll miss them and I guess they'll miss me. I plan to be away about four years, but I'll be home every Christmas at least. I am nervous about the trip, but at the same time really excited."</p>
<p>The youngster has won most, if not all, women's titles available in her hometown and still holds the Champion of Champions title. She is happy with her form before her final New Zealand event, the Horowhenua Open, this weekend.</p>
<p>"It will be my last before I go. I've played it a few times, but I think second is the best I've done."</p>
<p>Thompson-Newth celebrates her 20th birthday on August 13, has university orientation on August 20 and begins school proper on August 24.</p>
