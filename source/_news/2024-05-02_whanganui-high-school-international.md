A big thank you to [Whanganui & Partners](https://www.facebook.com/whanganuiandpartners?__cft__[0]=AZUdnqDVAtl7SrwhDs-tuXQ06iCPPU0zT7fVzBHWwegUhHpsGBfmqe4F5UxH6JfBo1ik6DChiqswsC_97r2r6MhbCOCtdLL8lddfjKfvOp0KfIunJVh3353RzxYeQczRLQX4L7AA1rT2GY3MvgwlQe_DOdm5d95bpeLBDT28Dgj5AA5ERAidbOckDEUkr1RexbfeBuTsU_hTahLGIw9IlCgF42AuKYJthK5-qewntlvqzu_Yv0fWSZ0RsvXnEYG2-aY&__tn__=-]K-R) for their ongoing support in showcasing Whanganui as a prime study destination for international students. With their support, recent tours for education delegates and agents have been a huge success, highlighting the unique blend of educational opportunities and cultural experiences Whanganui has to offer. We're excited to welcome more students from around the world to explore and learn with us.

Sharing what makes Whanganui amazing is a vital part of our work attracting people to the district and, in turn, boosting our local economy for the duration of [](<>)their visit. This month, our Capability lead, Rach, has been busy touring delegates and education agents around town, providing a taste of all that's on offer when someone comes to study abroad with us in Whanganui.

Whanganui & Partners

Eight delegates from Girls schools in Japan joined Education New Zealand travelling the country exploring ways to solve the gender equality gap in Japan. A key idea being to send groups and individuals to study in Aotearoa. Rach showcased Whanganui beautifully, touring tourist hotspots and Whanganui Girls College and Whanganui High School, where current Japanese students shared their experience and delegates could see classes in action.

We also had the pleasure of co-hosting international education agents alongside Venture Taranaki of New Plymouth. Representing South America, Germany, UK, Philippines, South Asia, and some Pacific Islands, the international agents can connect Whanganui with students from across the globe. Like our time with the Japanese delegates, Rach showed them the sights as well as our amazing education institutions, including the New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy.

There's no doubt about it, we have recently made some big fans of Whanganui for international study. We are looking forward to welcoming more overseas students to town in the future thanks to these new relationships.
