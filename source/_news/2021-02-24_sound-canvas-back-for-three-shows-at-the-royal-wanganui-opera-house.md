The third instalment of Brass Whanganui's Sound Canvas production will take place at the end of March, with the group showcasing almost an hour and a half of music, visual art, movement and theatre.

Due to Covid-19 the group hasn't performed Sound Canvas since October.

Despite the short turnaround, **Hamish Jellyman**, part of the creative team behind the latest show, said the new edition would feature completely different music and art.

"It's not far off the same amount of music we (Brass Whanganui) would normally do in a two-hour show, but the difference with this is there's no compere-ing like we'd do in standard concerts," Jellyman said.

"We're going bigger with the lighting this time around, and I think we're finding a better way to incorporate the poetry as well."

**Jellyman has composed two new songs for the shows next month, and has arranged two others.**

"I'm on the musical and crazy ideas team, which is really fun.

"Luckily the band seem to enjoy what I've come up with. It's cool to be able to write for a specific ensemble, because you know everyone's strength.

"We have a strong percussion section, for example, and this time around it will include **Michael Franklin-Browne** (Pluto, HLAH)."

The new edition of Sound Canvas was both an evolution and a continuation of previous year's concerts, Jellyman said, with some new surprises thrown in.

"Essentially it's the same kind of show with the same bits and bobs, but we're trying to keep it as interesting as possible.

"There are obviously certain limitations with the space and the ensemble, but we're trying to create more of an atmosphere than just playing music."

Jellyman said Sound Canvas required a lot more organisation than standard Brass Whanganui concerts.

"That's from the lighting, to the sound, to the way the programme runs.

"I think we're a pretty forward-thinking ensemble when it comes to traditional brass bands in New Zealand.

"We get a bit bored just doing the same old concerts each time, so really, for us, it **(Sound Canvas) is about having as much fun as we can.**

"The crazier the idea, the cooler it will probably turn out."

**Brass Whanganui's Sound Canvas will take place at the Royal Whanganui Opera House on March 27 (two shows) and March 28 (one show).**
