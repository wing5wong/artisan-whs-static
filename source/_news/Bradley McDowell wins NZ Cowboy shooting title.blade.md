<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui teenager Bradley McDowell is shooting for international glory after winning both the junior and overall titles at the cowboy action shooting nationals last weekend.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On the strength of that the 16-year-old <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> student will return to the End of the Trail World Championship of Cowboy Action Shooting in New Mexico next June in far stronger form. Last year, when New Zealand junior champion only, McDowell finished seventh in the world in New Mexico.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While the sport has romantic connotations and in times gone by was every child's dream to be judged a cowboy sharp shooter, it far from beating rival gunmen to the draw.<br />Cowboy action shooting involves shooting a series metal plate targets with three types of guns - a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun - in a memorised sequence. The goal is to complete the sequence as quickly possible. Missed targets however incur costly time penalties.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McDowell first won the junior title in 2015 and has held it ever since adding the overall New Zealand title to his arsenal at this year's nationals at the Wanganui Pistol Club in Airport Rd.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>McDowell won six GOLD medals in all after cleaning up in all disciplines against 93 other gunmen, including father Shaun who finished fifth.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That fifth, however, was enough to gain McDowell senior selection to the world championships in the US.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The New Zealand association falls under the umbrella of the world body, the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), so our nationals are called regionals but fully sanctioned by the world body," McDowell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McDowell junior now has a room loaded with trophies won at various levels and is understood to be the youngest winner of the overall New Zealand title and is rated a serious contender for a world title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It began for us as a way of learning gun safety and now me, Bradley and his younger brother Mitchell are into it, although Mitchell is out injured at the moment."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I won the North Island championship this season, but only because Bradley wasn't there, but I do still get to go the states."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young McDowell is now passionate about the sport and most of his mates think it's pretty cool they have a sharp shooting cowboy as a friend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I won all three categories this year, but I probably favour the pistol," Bradley McDowell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"And yeah it does have a romantic connotation to it being a sharp shooting cowboy, but in reality it's far from that. I don't even ride horses for a start. It's more about speed and mental agility. My aim is to become junior world champion in New Mexico next year. I have the trans-Tasman series against Australia in the South Island on Valentine's Day, February 14 as my final lead-up to the worlds, although I will also be competing in two state championships while I am in the US.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Oregon state championships are before the worlds and the Wyoming event after the worlds."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The sport is not cheap, though.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The firearms and other gear are quite expensive but one-off costs. The ammunition is probably the most expensive item. For the world championships alone Bradley will fire off about $2500 worth of ammo," his father said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Apart from his parents, Bradley's main sponsors include River City Recyclers, Avon McDonalds Equipment, Round Table and Wanganui Veterinary Services.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have others and without them I could afford to compete, so I am very grateful for their support. We could always do with more sponsorship, though."</p>
