<p>Wanganui's Cemetery Circuit is known for its motorbike racing, but this summer you'll be able to skate around the track.</p>
<p>In-line and quad skaters are invited to take part in Skate The Cemetery Circuit through the streets of Wanganui on January 3. Gary Clark, president of the Wanganui Skating Club, said there would be two options available - a one-lap race and a three-lap race.</p>
<p>"We want it to be a bit of fun and hope that people will dress up," Mr Clark said.</p>
<p>Entry will be $5 per person.</p>
<p>Mr Clark said the event is part of the national speed skating championships which will be held at Kowhai Park and Jubilee Stadium from December 29-30 and January 1-3.</p>
<p>Skate The Cemetery Circuit will be sandwiched between the junior half-marathon - 13 laps of the Cemetery Circuit - and the senior full marathon - 27 laps of the circuit.</p>
<p>"We're hoping this will bring the general public along to see the sport," Mr Clark said.</p>
<p>He said more than 300 skaters from Auckland to Timaru will come to Wanganui for the championships.</p>
<p>"We'll have former world championships, skaters currently skating for New Zealand - it's going to be a big event."</p>
