<p><span>MORE THAN WORDS: WHS student Ryan Peralta and other young artists have their work on display in the 27 Thousand Words exhibition.</span></p>
<p>Ryan Peralta is one of nine young Wanganui artists whose work has been on display in the McGruer's building on the corner of Guyton St and Victoria Ave for two weeks.</p>
<p>The exhibition, 27 Thousand Words, included three works by each of the nine artists, based on the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words".</p>
<p>Peralta's work S.H.A.R.K., which sold for $200, offers a shark's-eye view of swimmers and a kayak on the water surface above and a three-panelled painting, Splash, depicts two laughing boys splashing about on a flooded roadside.</p>
<p>"I'm from the Philippines and children there don't have a lot of technology so they make their own fun with whatever is around."</p>
<p>His family moved to Wanganui when he was 11. He is now 17 and a Year 13 student at Wanganui High School, with plans to study architecture at Victoria University next year.</p>
<p>"My third painting, Feathers are Worth More than just Money, was inspired by a visit to the Whanganui Museum when I saw the bones of the huia and learned how they were hunted to extinction and their feathers were sold for hat decorations," said Peralta.</p>
<p>Art is not his only passion. He plays keyboards with WHS Smokefree Rockquest winners Contraband and said he hoped to continue with music and art next year.</p>
<p>Peralta and the other young artists have been working with the CAYAD (Community Action Youth and Drugs) team from Nga Tai o Te Awa Trust to use art as a medium to express a positive youth voice.</p>
<p>Project facilitator Julie Herewini said each of the rangatahi (young people) was donating 25 per cent of each sale to a charity of his or her choice.</p>
<p>Peralta has chosen Te Ora Hou, a faith-based Maori youth organisation, as the recipient for his donation.</p>
