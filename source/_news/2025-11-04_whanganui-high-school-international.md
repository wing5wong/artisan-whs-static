Today, our Director of International Students, Natasha McKee,  had the wonderful pleasure of co-presenting with Kris Baker, Director of International Students at Taieri College, at the Embassy of New Zealand in Bangkok.

Together, they proudly introduced Whanganui High School and Taieri College to representatives from eight leading Thai education agencies, highlighting the unique opportunities for students to study in New Zealand’s safe, welcoming, and river-based communities.

A heartfelt thank you to Education New Zealand | Manapou ki te Ao, for their wonderful support in making this event possible.

We look forward to strengthening partnerships and welcoming Thai students to Whanganui High School in the near future!
