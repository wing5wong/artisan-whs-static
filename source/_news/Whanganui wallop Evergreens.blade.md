<p class="element element-paragraph">They did it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui women beat High School Hockey Club Evergreens on Saturday to become the Manawat큰 Women's Premier Reserve hockey champions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And it was convincing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When the final whistle blew in Palmerston North, the scoreboard read 5-0 and the Whanganui women celebrated a season of domination.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Player/coach Colleen Baylis heaped praise on her teammates.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our midfield were able to control the game well and talk to our junior players a lot and that really helped them," Baylis said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was our junior players that stepped up and really destroyed them with their speed."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Heading into the final, the Whanganui women had only lost one game and that was a 1-0 loss to Evergreens in May.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, they returned fire with authority and crushed Evergreens 3-0 earlier this month.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baylis said that the first half was "a little bit hairy".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Evergreens came out really hard, they denied us a lot of the space that we ordinarily have and because we haven't really experienced that, we struggled with it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They had a lot of goal-scoring opportunities which went unconverted. If they'd scored in that first half, it could have been a different game."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Instead, it was the Whanganui women that got on the board between the 10th and 15th minute, but to the credit of Evergreens, that remained the scoreline at half time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We muddled through that first half. We were able to regroup at half time. It gave us an opportunity to settle down and have a chat about things," Baylis said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just told our players to keep their composure on the ball. We were trying to do things too quickly and they marked a couple of our players quite hard."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Evergreens tried to continue implementing their gameplan of marking hard and restricting space, but five or 10 minutes into the second half they gave up another goal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And the floodgates opened.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui women put three more on the board before Evergreens were put out of their misery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scorers were <strong>Charlotte Baker</strong>, Kate Tylee, <strong>Melissa Goss</strong>, Sophie Redmayne and Georgia Matson.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The young guns, Redmayne and Matson, were standouts for Baylis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They found the space easier to handle in the second half and took their opportunities, which sometimes they were a bit hesitant to do in the season," she said. "It was good to see them stand up."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baylis said she had spent the last couple of days reflecting on the season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a weird feeling, I think we got to the end of the game and went 'Oh we won, okay that's cool, let's move on'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Having finished on top of the table, I think we knew that we should have won it and it would have definitely been a different feeling if we hadn't."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui women went into the final having scored a remarkable 73 goals on the season, at an average of six per game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On the flipside, they had only been scored against 15 times, which was just a tad over one goal scored on them a game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Evergreens had quite a good season. I always like playing against them and I was glad to play them in the final because it was a nice game and a nice atmosphere," Baylis said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has been a standout season for us. It was a good team effort. We've only been together for three years and I think this one has probably been the best."</p>
