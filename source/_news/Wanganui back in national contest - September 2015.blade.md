<p><span>READY FOR HISTORY: The first senior Wanganui team at the nationals in 15 years is coach Lisa Murphy (back left), Renee Butler (WHS), Kelera Kuruyabaki (former WHS), Sammy Murphy (WHS), Suzanne Guilford<span>&nbsp;(former WHS)</span>, Te Atawahi McDonnell, manager Donna Jeffery; Karaihi Peina (front left), Loni Martin, Rachael Lynch, Hayley Addenbrooke<span>&nbsp;(former WHS)</span>, Sophie Collins and Eleanor Hogan<span>&nbsp;(former WHS)</span>.</span></p>
<p>THE FIRST Netball Wanganui senior team to test itself at national level in 15 years will have to hit the hard court running this morning at the Lion Foundation National Championships in Wellington.</p>
<p>Coached by Lisa Murphy, Wanganui will play representative teams from other centres after Netball NZ decided to change the format this season, away from a competition involving regional squads selected from the best domestic players from five zones.</p>
<p>The Wanganui side was selected after the second annual Vanda Buttars Memorial Tournament between Northern, Southern and Metropolitan, along with a separate invitational trial of 21 players.</p>
<p>Manager Donna Jeffery said Murphy was pleased with how the squad had come together over their short preparation time of five weeks. "The team knows this tournament is a huge step up from the Wanganui Premier 1 club netball competition, but are looking forward to the challenge and the potential to play against Silver Ferns and up-and-coming stars of today."</p>
<p>Of the original 12 players named, East Club's Victoria Anstis and Marist's Mikayla Pihema-Taiaroa had to pull out due to school and work commitments, with Ruapehu's Loni Martin joining the team.</p>
<p>They have played a handful of games together after pre-nationals tournaments in Palmerston North and Wellington this month.</p>
<p>In Palmerston North Wanganui lost narrowly to Taranaki, before being well beaten by Hawke's Bay.</p>
<p>Their games in the capital saw them up against a near full-strength Wellington outfit, being beaten by them as well as Hutt Valley.</p>
<p>Wanganui's first game today at the Wellington ASB Sports Centre is against Dunedin at 10.30am, before taking on Hutt Valley again at 6pm. The other teams in their pool are North Harbour and Hawke's Bay.</p>
<p>Several local businesses and clubs have helped the new team get to nationals, including Aranui Farms, Stihl Shop, Marist Netball Club, Fitzies, Hire It, Mars Petcare, Ruapehu Sports Club and New World Supermarket.</p>
