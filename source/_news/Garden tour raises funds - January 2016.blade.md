<p>GOOD CAUSE: WHS student Lani Hall, 14, helps grow and sell plants for her grandmother Janice Hall's arthritis fundraiser.</p>
<p>It's not the same as the first flush of spring but summer gardens have a lot to offer, Whanganui Arthritis Anniversary Ramble organiser David Orr says.</p>
<p>Somme Pde was lined with parked cars yesterday as people flocked to the Clevelands' hub garden, where there were maps, information, a plant stall and refreshments.</p>
<p>The organisation always has its fundraising garden ramble on Wellington Anniversary Day, Mr Orr said. The weather was usually good and summer gardens had a different aspect, with roses in their second flush and perennials flowering.</p>
<p>This year there were 11 to tour, four on St John's Hill and the rest in the Aramoho/Papaiti area. Ticket sales have already rivalled last year's, when $5000 was raised. It was the group's best effort so far - but Mr Orr was hoping for more this year.</p>
