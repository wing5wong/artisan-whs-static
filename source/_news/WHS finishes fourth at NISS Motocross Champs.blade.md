<h3>Motocross: Whanganui High School finishes fourth at North Island Secondary Schools Championships in Rotorua.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Even when far from home, the Whanganui High School team had another strong collective performance at the North Island Secondary Schools Motocross Championships in Rotorua on Friday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Crown jewel for the group of local riders who attend these events has always been <strong>James Rountree</strong>, who was the defending champion from 2018 in both the 250cc and 125cc class for 15-19 Years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Last year's North Island champs were held locally at Languard Bluff, with WHS having 16 riders taking part on their home track and their collective points adding up to make them first overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, it was a much smaller contingent of five riders who made the trip over to Rotorua, but they still punched above their weight as WHS finished fourth in the overall standings by school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Over 200 riders competed in seven different classes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This time, <strong>Rountree </strong>finished second in 250cc, while he was fourth in 125cc.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Ajah Sullivan</strong>, third in the 12-19 Year Girls class last year, had placings of fourth and then two of fifth from her three races to finish fifth for her division.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the other results, <strong>Riki Wainhouse</strong> moved up an age group to finish 13th in the 15-19 Years for 125cc, while <strong>Alex Luff Scott</strong> was 22nd for 250cc in the same age class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Troy Bullock</strong>, third in Year 12-16 for the 85cc class, finished 10th this time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountree's father Antony said the next major event for these students is the New Zealand Junior Motocross Championships, which will be held in the last weekend of April at the Flips Track near Foxton.</p>
