A mother of three from Whanganui who has gone through breast cancer twice is encouraging Kiwis to get involved with Pink Ribbon Breakfast month this July.

Kristy Humphries was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013, soon after she had finished breast-feeding her youngest child. She had a mastectomy and went through chemotherapy, then had a breast reconstruction in 2015. Then last year at her annual mammogram she discovered a new tumour in her breast and had to undergo further surgery, chemo and radiation.

Now Kristy is hosting her second Pink Ribbon Breakfast event to raise vital funds for Breast Cancer Foundation NZ and raise awareness about the disease. Kristy’s Pink Ribbon Auction, Cocktails & Canapés evening will be at Mint Café on 12 July, 5pm - 7pm (see picture below).

Kristy said: “I’m fundraising for Breast Cancer Foundation because I want to do my part to help find a cure. I don’t want my daughter or anyone else to have to go through this.

“For a while I didn’t want anything to do with cancer – I’d lost three friends to secondary breast cancer and I couldn’t face it anymore. But now that I’ve gone through it again, I want to make people aware about breast cancer and how important it is for women to check their breasts.

“Pink Ribbon Breakfast is such a great way to raise awareness while having some fun and creating some good memories. There are so many moments you can’t laugh about when you go through breast cancer, so it’s nice to be able to get together with friends and have a good time. I’ve come a long way with my own journey, so now I want to do something to make other people’s journeys a little bit lighter and easier.”

Last year more than 25 breakfasts were held in Whanganui, where around 40 people are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.

With more than 3,300 women across the country diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and more than 650 a year still dying, the need for support is greater than ever. This has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, where around 400 women who would have received a breast cancer diagnosis, missed out on getting mammograms or a referral from their GP, delaying their ability to start treatment.

Proceeds from Pink Ribbon Breakfast will go towards helping these women get the support they need, as well as those already undergoing treatment. They will also help to drive early detection and ground-breaking research to prevent further deaths.

Evangelia Henderson, Chief Executive of Breast Cancer Foundation NZ, said: “We are so grateful to everyone who is taking part in Pink Ribbon Breakfast. This year, the COVID-19 situation has made life harder for breast cancer patients, so the need for support has never been higher.

“Thanks to the generosity of Kiwis up and down the country, we are able to continue our life-saving work. The proceeds raised from Pink Ribbon Breakfast will bring us one step closer to our vision of zero deaths from breast cancer. So, please get involved in whatever way you can – your support will make a real difference.”
