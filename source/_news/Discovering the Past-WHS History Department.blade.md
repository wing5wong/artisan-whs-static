<p><strong>Discovering the Past: WHS History Department</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Over the past 6 weeks the History Department at WHS has been extremely busy. The Level 1 students have been looking at how we honour the past by looking at the many monuments of Whanganui. This has meant two walking trips into town and extremely successful visits to the Alexander research library as well as Queen&rsquo;s Park, Moutoa Gardens, the War Memorial Hall and Veteran&rsquo;s Steps, Cook&rsquo;s Gardens and even the Watt fountain. In addition, students have been conducting their own research by interviewing people in the city about the significance of the monuments.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In writing up their assessments, many students commented on how they have passed many of these monuments without thinking about them, and learning about why these monuments came to be there has certainly brought the city to life for them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Meanwhile with this year being the &nbsp;centennial year of the Battle of Passchendaele, the Level 2 and 3 students visited the National War Museum in Wellington where we spent a fascinating day looking at World WAr I history with a focus on Passchendaele. We were lucky enough to lay a wreath at the cenotaph which was a nice way to wrap up our visit.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Then last week we were particularly privileged to have Glyn Harper, Professor of War Studies at Massey University and author of&nbsp;</span><span>Dark Journey</span><span>&nbsp;which is specifically about Passchendaele, visit to deliver a fascinating lecture on this tragic event. It was a pleasure to have representatives from City College and Whanganui Collegiate also attend this fascinating lecture. After lunch the focus shifted to researching the First World War memorials which was also a fascinating topic.</span></p>
