<p>Pae Rangatahi was held in Waitara this year on 21 June 2018.&nbsp; It was a non-competitive gathering in which teams perform without judgement.&nbsp; We are all proud of the wonderfully enthusiastic performance by Kia Whaiora.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Speech competitions Sophia &lsquo;Unga-Cribb came 1st in the Junior English section and will go on to compete at the Nationals in Gisborne in September.</p>
