<p><strong>Congratulations to both junior debating teams for winning their first debates.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Team Kakariki won against Palmerston North Girls&rsquo; High on 6 April. Debaters on our affirming team were: Lauren Phillips (best speaker), Eve Parker-Groves and Ashlea Hale. Thanks to Raoul Sarup for adjudicating.</p>
<p>Team Kowhai won against Freyberg High School on 13&nbsp;April. Debaters on our negating team were: Ashlea Hale (best speaker), Dominic Benfell and Ciaran Mee. Thanks to Leigh-Ana Hale for adjudicating.</p>
<p>In both cases the moot was: <strong>This house believes that social media does more harm than good.</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The photos show Team Kowhai receiving feedback from their adjudicators in the Freyberg High School library.</p>
<p><em>Mrs Vicki Kasner</em><br /><em>HOD English</em></p>
