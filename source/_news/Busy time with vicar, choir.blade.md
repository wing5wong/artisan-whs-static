<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />It was a busy and enjoyable weekend, beginning on Friday with a hilarious evening at Amdram.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Director Chris McKenzie can take a bow, as can the actors and everyone who helped present The Vicar of Dibley. It was a riot and so very true to the TV series.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The first thing we noticed was the set and wealth of appropriate props. Dividing the stage into three was a piece of genius, allowing scene changes by lighting alone.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The second thing we noticed was the superb casting. Each and every cast member captured the essence of their character, leaving the audience in no doubt that they were seeing Geraldine Granger, Alice Tinker, David Horton, Hugo Horton, Letitia Cropley, Frank Pickle, Jim Trott and Owen Newitt. They were all superb . . . and funny. They had a good script, true, but each was able to convey humour in so many different ways. Joan Street as Letitia got a laugh the moment she entered the scene! It could have been the hats and costumes, but a lot of it was Joan.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The play follows the fortunes of Dibley, from the death of their vicar and the arrival of the new one (Geraldine Granger, played so well by Jayne Fields), through to the circus of a wedding when Alice (Tori Whibley) and Hugo (Heath McKenzie) tie the knot, complete with Teletubbies, luminous headress and inappropriate behavour.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The audience loved every minute &mdash; what better praise?</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">There&rsquo;s no need to single out cast members because they all did so well, from the experienced thespians to those taking baby steps on stage. <strong>Tori Whibley</strong> IS Alice Tinker; Colin McKinney had David Horton&rsquo;s conservative, elitist character just perfect; Mike Street did real justice to the character of vestry minutetaker Frank Pickle, making him so boring he was hilarious; Ian Jones excelled as the dithering Jim Trott; Patrick McKenna was completely true to the unique, off-colour character that is Owen Newitt; <strong>Heath McKenzie</strong> did young Hugo to a T, certainly securing his future as an actor; Jayne had Dawn French&rsquo;s mannerisms and turn of phrase off pat and the extra cast members did a lovely job too. <strong>Maddi McKenzie&rsquo;s</strong> last minute entrance got a huge laugh!</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Every single actor played the part in relation to those around them, with each line part of a conversation rather than a speech, even the Vicar&rsquo;s asides. They seemed relaxed and comfortable in their roles.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">To the best of my knowledge the rest of the run is fully booked, and that alone speaks volumes.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Carol Webb has written a great review (page 23) and I can only say &mdash; I concur!<br /><br /><br /></p>

<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />The other event was the Lyric Singers&rsquo; concert Taking Flight at Trinity Methodist Church on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to hear this excellent choir, but the occasion was made even more special by a range of special guests with an emphasis on youth.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Brass Whanganui gave us two segments, the first comprising a talented group of youngsters under the baton of Tracy Wilson, followed by Concert Brass with Bruce Jellyman. They really rocked the venue with musical variety and skill.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Others featured in the programme were Sophie Toyne, Leigh-ana Hale, Jan Kruger and Chantelle Piper.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Nine-year-old Sophie stunned the audience with her powerful, true voice, singing Tomorrow (from Annie) and Walking in the Air (from The Snowman). If she&rsquo;s this good now, she will be one to watch over the years to come.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>Leigh-ana Hale</strong>, a year 13 Whanganui High School student, impressed with her beautiful renditions of Across the Wide Missouri and I Could Have Danced All Night. For her first number she was assisted on violin by Jan Kruger. Leigh-ana&rsquo;s voice &mdash; big, clear and musical &mdash; rang through the church, complementing her strong stage presence.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Both girls are students of <strong>Marie Brooks</strong> and were accompanied by her on piano.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Chantelle Piper is a flute student of Lisa Boessenkool and shows exceptional talent. She played three numbers, assisted by her teacher on piano and in a flute duet &mdash; Sarabande, Der Vogelfanger Bin Ich Ja and My Heart Will Go On.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">There was still plenty of time to hear the Lyric Singers in full song and multi-part harmonies, giving us a range of styles and genres, including a Seekers&rsquo; medley, which struck a chord with those of a certain age. Conductor <strong>Joanna Love</strong> and accompanist Lisa Boessenkool took the choir through their paces with grace and energy, and, at one stage, swapped roles. We also saw Joan Sullivan take the baton while Joanna joined the ranks of the choir.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It was a lovely concert, with loads of surprises and variety, and a large crowd filled the pews for the afternoon&rsquo;s entertainment.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to hear this excellent choir, but the occasion was made even more special by a range of special guests with an emphasis on youth.</p>
