<p><strong>Former WHS student Kyle Lawson with WHS Instrumental Music Tutor of Brass Bruce Jellyman.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Top Cornet player Kyle Lawson features in Brass Whanganui concert this Sunday.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kyle Lawson was taught the cornet by the late Kevin Jarrett and is now regarded as one of the finest young cornet players in the world.</strong> After being part of the NZ Army Band from 2012 to 2015, Kyle moved to Manchester where he joined the Brighouse and Rasktrick band, rated the top band in England, as Principal Cornet player. He played concerts with them most weekends including a tour of Ireland and c<span class="text_exposed_show">ompetitions in England and Europe.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>On Sunday, February 25, Kyle will be playing with Brass Whanganui in a concert at Christ Church.</strong> The concert starts at 2pm. Tickets available only at the door. The prices are adults $25, seniors $20 and students $15. Children under 15 are free.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">After the European Brass Band Championships in Lille, France, Kyle returned to the NZ Army Band in 2016 before going to Victoria University to study music. Later this year he will be going to Salford University back in England, where David King, his teacher since 2010, was Head of Brass.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">While back in New Zealand, Kyle has been with the Navy Band in Napier for the Art Deco celebrations and will be going to Christchurch to play with the Army band. He has also been guest soloist with the National Secondary School and the National Youth brass bands. In Whanganui he has been tutoring.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>In the concert Kyle will be playing four solos, two with the band and two with Joanna Love (WHS teacher), the accompanist for Brass Whanganui.</strong> These are:<br />&bull; Life&rsquo;s Pageant. A traditional light showy piece;<br />&bull; Don&rsquo;t Doubt Him Now &ndash; a slower Salvation Army composition;<br />&bull; Zelda. Another traditional brass band piece and &ldquo;one of the most popular cornet solos&rdquo; says Kyle;<br />&bull; Macushla. A lovely slow piece.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Bruce Jellyman, Director of Brass Whanganui says, &ldquo;I like Christ Church as a venue. The church is comparatively narrow, making the audience right in front of you. It makes for good listening.&rdquo;</span></p>
