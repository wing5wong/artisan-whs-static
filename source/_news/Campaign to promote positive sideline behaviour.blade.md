<p><span>Former Silver Fern Joline Henry (centre, back) was in Whanganui recently to launch the Community Good Sports campaign.</span></p>
<p>Sport Whanganui has launched it's Community Good Sports campaign which aims to promote good behaviour at sport.</p>
<p>The programme was being run with the support of the Whanganui District Council's youth committee Dub.Dee.See. and Four Our Kids.</p>
<p>The campaign also has the backing of former Silver Fern Joline Henry and former All Black Glen Osborne.</p>
<p>Sport Whanganui has consulted the region's sports clubs, schools and community groups to get an idea of what issues they face and to help build awareness.</p>
<p>"We've all witnessed it; the yelling and bad behaviour on the sideline and during the game," Sport Whanganui's community sport leader, Jodie Brunger said.</p>
<p>"People often complain and agree someone should do something but many aren't sure what to do or say. The issue is complicated, with many different expectations, values and beliefs across our community."</p>
<p>She said there was a need for issues to be addressed, particularly at children's sport.</p>
<p>"It's crucial our young people are exposed to positive sporting experience, so they go on to reach their full potential and view sport as a positive part of a healthy lifestyle."</p>
<p>The Community Good Sports project team will focus will be on providing information to help sports organisations establish the policies, processes, personnel and action plans necessary for positive change.</p>
<p>"The support provided will be tailored to meet individual needs and will be designed to be adaptable and to work alongside other national guidelines in place.</p>
<p>"A major part will be to support them in engaging their stakeholders (athletes, players, coaches, parents, officials, volunteers, fans and the wider community) in a campaign where everyone becomes invested in minimising negative behaviour and bringing about positive outcomes for the whole community."</p>
<p>The campaign's slogan is "be a sport and just support".</p>
<p>"Our approach, as the campaign information resources highlight, will be to focus on promoting a positive and proactive approach to this issue - how we should act, what we should do," Brunger said.</p>
