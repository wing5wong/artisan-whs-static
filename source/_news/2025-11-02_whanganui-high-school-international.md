Our Director of International Students, Natasha McKee, visited several education agents in Osaka and Tokyo this week, building new connections and strengthening existing partnerships.

A real highlight was catching up with Ryohei Shimohashi, Mami Higuchi, and Director Motonari Suzuki, who led a group of 32 students and 20 adults to Whanganui in August.

They absolutely LOVED their time at Whanganui High School and can’t wait to return next year! 💚

We’re excited to keep working closely with Whanganui & Partners to make their next visit even more memorable. 🇳🇿✨
