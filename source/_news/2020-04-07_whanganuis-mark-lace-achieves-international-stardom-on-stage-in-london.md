Whanganui High School 2014 graduate, Mark Lace has achieved something pretty incredible in the arts, on an international scale. 

After graduating Ettingshausens academy of dance in Sydney, he spent a few years contracting, joining a successful dance crew called Phly Crew before landing his breakthrough role - a lead dancer in Magic Mike Live in London. 

This is the official dance and theatre performance created by Channing Tatum. The show is hosted 5 nights a week, up to 3 sold-out shows a night in Leicester Square, Central London.

The show comprises of a mixture of dancing, acrobatics and acting, crowd interaction and a vocal feature from Channing Tatum himself. 

Alongside this, Mark has also been involved in modeling and competed in dance competitions against very high-profile dance crews. 

While the show is on hold due to Covid-19, Mark is sticking it out in London with reduced income and social distancing measures which makes being so far from home, just that little bit harder.

We wish you all the best Mark, stay safe.
