Whanganui High School 2014 graduate, Mark Lace has achieved something pretty incredible in the arts, on an international scale. 

After graduating Ettingshausens academy of dance in Sydney, he spent a few years contracting, joining a successful dance crew called Phly Crew before landing his breakthrough role - a lead dancer in Magic Mike Live in London. 

This is the official dance and theatre performance created by Channing Tatum. The show is hosted 5 nights a week, up to 3 sold-out shows a night in Leicester Square, Central London.

The show comprises of a mixture of dancing, acrobatics and acting, crowd interaction and a vocal feature from Channing Tatum himself. 

Alongside this, Mark has also been involved in modeling and competed in dance competitions against very high-profile dance crews. 

While the show is on hold due to Covid-19, Mark is sticking it out in London with reduced income and social distancing measures which makes being so far from home, just that little bit harder.
