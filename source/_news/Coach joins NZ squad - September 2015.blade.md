<p><strong>WHS student Jimi Blinkhorne</strong> chosen to represent NZ in the U14 Trans Tasman Roller Hockey tournament in Dandenong, Melbourne on 1st &amp; 2nd August.</p>
<p>Carlin Barry, a member of the Wanganui Roller Hockey Club, is also coach of the local Wanganui Youth team. He says he was also lucky enough to be selected as the coach for the Under 14 New Zealand team which recently played in Australia.</p>
<p>"New Zealand recently sent five teams to Dandenong, Melbourne to compete in a Trans Tasman test series, where each team played in the best of three series. About 25 players and supporters just from Wanganui took the trip over during the weekend of August 1-2," he says. In the Under 14 team there were six representatives from the Wanganui Roller Skating Club.</p>
<p>"These outstanding young people were Cody Lockett (Captain), Mitchell Lockett, <strong>Jimi Blinkhorne (vice captain)</strong>, Eli Zinsli, Ricky Wilkinson (goalkeeper) and Paige Teki-Langford (goalkeeper)."</p>
<p>The team played in three tight and exciting tests, working hard to the end and coming out victorious. In the first test they drew 2-2. In the second test New Zealand went out to a four goal lead 8-4, but Australia refused to give in and came from behind to win 9-8. This meant the New Zealand team had to win the third test by two goals to win by goal average. This game could have gone either way. New Zealand controlled the possession as they did in the first two games but Australia came from behind again to reduce the Kiwi lead to one goal, this forcing the game into overtime.</p>
<p>"In a very intense sudden death overtime the Australians took the hit off and then local boy Mitchell Lockett managed to turn over the ball and scored the winning goal in the first 10 seconds," says Carlin.<br />"The team was very happy with their successful first ever test for their country.<br />"They trained hard, fundraised like crazy and played unbelievable games where they had the crowd on their feet for their entire game!"</p>
<p>The local members had a lot of support from local businesses and would like to thank them all.</p>
<p>Sponsors are: Loaders, C&amp;C Painting Services, Pirtek, Totalspan, Flight Centre, Kitchen Contours Ltd, Harrisons Hire Master, Harvey Round Motors, TRS, Elite Mechanical &amp; Engineering, Ross Francis Panelbeating, Chefs Choice ...&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">without these businesses it would not have been possible to get these kids there.</span></p>
