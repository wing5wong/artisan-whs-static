<p><span>TEAM STAR: Wanganui's Hannah Smith (former WHS student)&nbsp;was the best local performer at the artistic skating national championships in Taranaki.</span></p>
<p>A new-look Wanganui team attended the 2015 NZ Roller Sports Artistic Championships in late July, returning from New Plymouth with two medals from competition and a third uncontested gold.</p>
<p>Wanganui Speed Skating Club spokesman Ken Smith said the artistic team was in a rebuilding phase following the recent departure of several accomplished skaters and the retirement of their long-time coach, Hastings-based Eileen Mills.</p>
<p>Through the area competitions, five Wanganui skaters qualified for the July 13-18 nationals, led by the experienced cousins Hannah and Emily Smith.</p>
<p>Joining them were Callista Booth-Richards, Kaitlyn Huirua and Julia Van Neikerk.</p>
<p>In the farewell event for coach Mills, Booth-Richards and Huirua both made the final of the Novice Figures in a large field.</p>
<p>Booth-Richards, the youngest and newest Wanganui competitor, gained a well-earned bronze medal, performing a solid and consistent set.</p>
<p>"Hannah Smith was the standout performer with a personal best in Junior International Solo and Freedance, gaining a bronze with a very small margin between first, second and third placing," said Ken Smith.</p>
<p>"Emily Smith and Van Neikerk turned in strong performances with top five placings in their respective events."</p>
<p>The 18-year-old Hannah Smith also received an uncontested gold medal in Junior International Figure.</p>
<p>She also picked up two further trophies.</p>
<p>"She won the overall Junior International Skater with the most points overall," said Smith.</p>
<p>"She was awarded the prestigious 2015 Volunteer of the Year award for her work coaching the younger Wanganui Artistic skaters and also for her work with the club's 'Learn To Skate' classes, where she has built up a large and enthusiastic following of artistic youngsters.</p>
<p>"In the absence of Mills, the future of the section now rests with Palmerston North's Kylie Shirley and on the young shoulders of Hannah."</p>
