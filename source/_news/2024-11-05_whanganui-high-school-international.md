📢 Whanganui on the International Stage at the Okinawa College and Career Fair!

Our Whanganui delegation recently attended the Okinawa International College and Career Fair, where we had the pleasure of connecting with a great number of students and parents. We were delighted to see such a strong interest in Whanganui as a study destination for their children. Whanganui's unique learning experiences and welcoming community were major highlights for many attendees. We look forward to seeing new international faces and sharing our beautiful region with students from around the world! 🌏📚 #WhanganuiInternational #StudyNewZealand #OkinawaFair #whanganuihighschool
