**A huge congratulations to Nat Kirk (Year 11), who was awarded the WDC Youth Recognition Award at the pattillo Whanganui Arts Review.**

Also to those who were courageous in submitting their entries, especially the following that were accepted: 

Merle Chant (Yr13), Kaye Coombs (Visual Art Teacher), Briana Gregg (Yr13), Graham Hall (Visual Art Teacher), Georgia Haupt (Yr10), Rose Hird (Yr12), Yegor Pohorilyi (Yr10), Kate Regan (Yr12) and Freyja Wrigglesworth (Yr11).  

There were many past students also accepted into the review.  

Our Visual Art Department is super proud of you all!  

Excuse the less than perfect photography- just means you need to get the Sarjeant on the Quay to see them in person! Well worth the effort -on until 17 May.
