<p>A Whanganui-born developer and freelance agricultural journalist has won an international award that will take her to the United States.</p>
<p>Former WHS student, Samantha Tennent, and nine others have been announced as recipients of the 2019 IFAJ/Alltech young leaders in Agricultural Journalism Award.</p>
<p>The recipients will attend the 2019 IFAJ Congress in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they will also do a leadership boot camp in July.</p>
<p>They come from all over the world including Ghana, Liberia, Germany, Sweden and the UK.</p>
<p>Tennent, 29, said it felt surreal to be selected.</p>
<p>"It's pretty prestigious getting picked amongst them. It's not like I was just against other Kiwis, I was the little Kiwi going against the world," Tennent said.</p>
<p>"It didn't feel real. You just get an email, you don't talk to people about it. Reality will hit me when I hop on a plane by myself and travel all the way to America."</p>
<p>Tennent lives in Palmerston North where she works for DairyNZ as a developer, a role that has her helping to convert scientific discoveries into something farmers can use.</p>
<p>She is also working as a freelance agricultural journalist, a role she got into less traditionally than others.</p>
<p>"I have a great-aunt on my granddad's side and she's based in Auckland. When I was finishing uni, we used to write letters or cards back and forth every now and then," Tennent said.</p>
<p>"One day she said to my granddad 'Sam writes such lovely letters, why doesn't she look at writing as a career'?"</p>
<p>At the time Tennent had finished studying at Massey University in Palmerston North and was looking for a job.</p>
<p>She contacted the publisher of her favourite magazine asking for a chance to write for them and they obliged, beginning Tennent's career in writing.</p>
<p>"I'm only just owning that now. I've been writing for quite a while. I started in 2012 really casually and not with any training," she said.</p>
<p>"Just before I started with Dairy NZ, my partner Johan Fourie and I set up our own business. We've got a little company and I do freelance work."</p>
<p>Tennent grew up in Whanganui where her parents Kim and Robert live on a lifestyle block in Westmere, but she had little to do with agriculture growing up in Gonville.</p>
<p>"I didn't have anything to do with agriculture until uni. I wanted to be a vet when I was young and when I got pregnant at 17 I had to decide what I was going to do," Tennent said.</p>
<p>"I looked at all the options available and went with the bachelor of veterinary technology. I thought 'this is cool, it's a compromise, I can have my baby and still be involved in the industry'."</p>
<p>Her first job following the course was working with LIC while living in Marton. While there she joined the Marton Young Farmers Club and is currently their chairwoman.</p>
<p>It was during a six month placement before university that Tennent came across dairy heifers for the first time and fell in love with them.</p>
<p>She is looking forward to seeing plenty over in the US when she flies out on July 23, set for a return on August 2.</p>
<p>"I'm really excited about the fact that the trip is so ag-specific and we are going to get the opportunity to see farms over there.</p>
<p>"That's the most exciting part, I get to go and see how another part of the world does it, what they're doing in that space."</p>
