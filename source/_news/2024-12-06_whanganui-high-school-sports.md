Well done to our Junior Cricket team at the Junior Cricket T16 Festival Day run by Greg & Verity at Cricket Whanganui! It was a great tournament between 4 schools - to cap off the end of a 5 week competition! Special thanks to our Cricket Umpire extraordinaire Mr Graham Hall and Super Coach Hamish McGregor! Mr Hall gives up his time to umpire for our WHS teams on Saturdays and at tournaments! And Hamish loves his cricket and coaches these boys for their T16 Thursday games and [](<>)T20 Saturday games! You might also see him in the field showing the boys some moves! Thanks also to Greg & Verity for keeping cricket alive and well in our community 
and providing our juniors with some memorable cricketing experiences!
