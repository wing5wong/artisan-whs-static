<p>Mouse Trap Hockey Shop is passing the ball to Wanganui Hunting and Fishing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Michelle Low commonly known as "Mouse" closed her hockey shop for personal reasons but long-time friends Clint and Nicola Skedgwell, who own Wanganui Hunting and Fishing, stepped in to take her place.</p>
<p>Mrs Skedgwell said "Mouse" had been helping them set up the shop situated at the back of their hunting and fishing store on Carton Avenue.</p>
<p>"Mouse approached us to see whether we would keep the hockey support going so we bought all her stock and here we are.</p>
<p>"Hockey is a growing sport in Whanganui and it's great to be able to support all the up and comings," Mrs Skedgwell said.</p>
<p>Over half of the Wanganui Hunting and Fishing staff play hockey which Ms Skedgwell said will be an added advantage.</p>
<p>Mrs Skedgwell previously represented New Zealand and now plays locally. Her employee Melissa Hylton also represented New Zealand and now coaches the first eleven team for Whanganui High School. Another full time employee, Kane Watkin, currently plays for the Mens Tech 1st division.</p>
<p>"We want to help out school tournaments and encourage people to buy locally rather than online. So we need the support from schools and the hockey community."</p>
<p>Mrs Skedgwell said the hockey shop will run under Wanganui Hunting and Fishing making it more flexible.</p>
<p>"We will see how it all goes but being open seven days and being part of a larger store is a great benefit."</p>
