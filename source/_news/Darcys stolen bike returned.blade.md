<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Darcy Britton's precious tandem bike has been returned to him</strong> - and whoever stole it left a note explaining why they did so.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Monday the&nbsp;<em>Wanganui Chronicle</em>&nbsp;reported on the plight of Darcy, 17, who has been blind for the past three years because of a brain tumour. The Whanganui High School student's only form of transport is a tandem bike, which he rides with his mother, Colleen Lee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Saturday night Darcy and Colleen were both out. Someone stole the tandem from their locked shed, leaving them upset and angry.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The pair pleaded with the thief to return the tandem - no questions asked. And it seems their plea was heard.<span style="background-color: #e2e2e2;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"On Tuesday night, my mum's friend came round and found the bike leaning against the front fence," Darcy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And there was a note attached: "Sorry, I was drunk. I hope I haven't wrecked the bike."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was rapt - I was happy as," Darcy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The bike wasn't "wrecked", but it did have some scraped paint and jammed brakes, which were fixed by a trip to a local bike shop.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Colleen said they have no idea who stole the tandem.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm just relieved. And I'd like to thank whoever brought it back," she said.</p>
