All the best to our Whanganui High Schools athletics team as they embark this week on another mission to the N.Z secondary school athletics championships and has a very strong team this year especially in sprints, hurdles, jumps and relays.  We have some nationally ranked athletes as well as a strong group of juniors looking to gain valuable experience at this level of competition.  Athletics has been the top performing sport at national level for WHS over the last 6 years [](<>)with 8 national titles and 27 medals overall achieved at the premier national secondary schoolâ€™s competition, and the team is looking to carry on this proud tradition in 2024. The team leaves today for Timaru with the champs running Friday, Saturday and Sunday, live results and livestream of events can be accessed through the NZSSA website for anyone keen to follow the teams progress.
