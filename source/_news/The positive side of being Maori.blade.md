<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a bid to endorse Māori culture in the media, former Whanganui Kokohuia student, Leigh-Marama McLachlan, pursued a career in broadcast journalism and landed a job with Radio New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 27-year-old said she was conscious of the type of stories told about Māori in that they were mostly negative, so she aimed to tell another side of being Māori.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And she worked hard to get there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Before becoming a student at Whanganui High School, all of her schooling had been taught in te reo Māori at a small total immersion kura.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had to teach myself how to read English when I was about 8 and before high school I had had only a few formal English lessons," Ms McLachlan said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five years later she leaped from WHS head girl to a New Zealand Broadcasting student to Radio New Zealand broadcaster and now senior communications advisor at Te Puni Kōkiri (The Ministry for Māori Development).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But picking her chosen career wasn't as clear-cut as one might have hoped.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I always had an idea that I would pursue something in the media but when I left school I didn't really know much about it," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms McLachlan said she took a year off after finishing school and worked as a retail manager in Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Having a year off was great for me. It gave me time to really think about what I wanted to do."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She applied to study at New Zealand Broadcasting School in Christchurch and initially didn't make the cut but two weeks before the course started she got a call and a spot was open for her.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had put all my eggs in this basket so I was pretty gutted when I didn't get in but that taught me a lot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Up until that point everything, to an extent, had seemed to go my way. It was really good to have that setback as a reality check and I remember feeling more humble when I did get in," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Out of the 80 students that applied, only 20 got in.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms McLachlan said when she decided to apply for the course she went back to WHS to use their facilities to practice recording herself.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had to record myself talking about my life, write an opinion piece, and do a segment talking about the weather... among other things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it wasn't until she began her course that she really discovered her passion and after graduating she landed as a journalist for Radio New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I actually applied for a senior role with Radio New Zealand in Nelson, because there really wasn't much advertised, anyway I was told that I didn't have the experience for a senior role but they gave me a job in Wellington instead which worked out better anyway.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It just shows that you really do have to make the most of every opportunity out there."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So, why broadcasting?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There is incredible power in broadcasting and I have always felt really privileged to be on the radio and to have that platform to tell stories that I think are important."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In June, Ms McLachlan took on her next challenge becoming senior communications advisor at Te Puni Kōkiri.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is similar to my old work in that I am still telling a lot of stories about what's happening out there in Māori communities - just a little different."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The advice she would give students unsure on a career would be to take a year off to have a blow out and consider their options.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I know a lot of people that went straight from school to university to get degrees that they didn't rate it. It's a waste of time and money."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For students considering a career in broadcasting she recommended engaging in as many life skills as possible.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"As a journalist life skills are great. It's not easy reporting on changes to things like mortgage rates or families dealing with issues with their children.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For me, I was a lot better at my job once I had my two boys because they put things in perspective - you know what's important in life. And so I felt like I understood a big part of our society a lot better and that helped me to be a better journalist."</p>
