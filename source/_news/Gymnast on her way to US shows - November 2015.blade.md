<p>BACK TO THE WORLD: Wanganui's Millie Manning (WHS student) is once again training hard and fundraising to travel to overseas competition with the NZ Development team.</p>
<p>LAST time she went wide-eyed, this time 16-year-old Millie Manning is mentally steeled for the task at hand in Hawaii in January.</p>
<p>The pride of the Wanganui Boys &amp; Girls Gym Club, Manning has been selected for the New Zealand Development team for the second time, set to compete in Level 9-10 gymnastics at two American shows - Gymnastics in Paradise, January 8-10 and Aloha Gym Fest, January 15-17.</p>
<p>Wanganui coach Kelly Taylor-Ward said American and Japanese teams entered these shows in Hawaii last year, around the same time as the New Zealand Development team competed in Singapore, where Manning made her international debut. "It's so popular over there, it's pretty massive."</p>
<p>The difference this time is Manning, who came fourth at the recent national championships, has self belief, given a year ago Taylor-Ward had to give extra encouragement to the teenager to push herself for that level, telling Manning she was ready.</p>
<p>"I think she's a bit more confident, she believes she can do it now. She's matured a bit and knows what it's all about," said Taylor-Ward.</p>
<p>"She works so hard, she fully deserves it."</p>
<p>In Hawaii, Manning will compete in all the gymnastics apparatus - which includes floor routine, the vault, and bars.</p>
<p>Having dedicated herself to competitive gymnastics for years, Manning's achievement of making high levels in New Zealand is impressive, given she does not have direct peers to work up with at her Wanganui club.</p>
<p>No one near her is at Level 10, but she will strive all the same, even going down to do her own practices if Taylor-Ward is unavailable.</p>
<p>"She's a bit of an awesome one to coach, when they're that keen. In the gym, it's harder to be the best in your club and your region. It's easier to be No 2 and have something to work towards.</p>
<p>"The closest [person], geographically, in her level is in Wellington. Coming from a small town, you've got to travel to competition all the time. Most of hers are in the upper North Island."</p>
<p>The other obstacle to Hawaii is the expenses. As one of four siblings, it is not easy to raise the money to travel overseas - last year, Manning managed to raise $5500 to go to Singapore.</p>
<p>"In this country, gymnastics is all self-funded. Even the kids that went to the Commonwealth Games did it by sausage sizzle," said Taylor-Ward.</p>
