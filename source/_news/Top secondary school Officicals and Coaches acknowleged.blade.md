<h4>BUSY REF: WHS student Charlie Brown was named&nbsp;Official of the Year at the Whanganui Secondary Schools Sports Awards at Cullinane College.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Winners of the coach and official of the year at The Hits Whanganui Secondary Schools Sports Awards 2017 are both from mainstream sporting codes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach of the Year went to Wanganui Collegiate's Zeal Hanna, assistant coach of the senior boys' rowing squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Surprisingly, there was only one nomination for this category, but Hanna was such a worthy contender, the judges had no hesitation in awarding him the title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hanna assisted with all major boats in A finals at Maadi Cup and the bronze medal winning under-16 coxed four at the North Island Secondary Schools regatta and the under-15 coxed four that was fourth at nationals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hanna is one of the most successful coxswains in recent times at WCS. He coxed the 2016 eight to first in the A final, for only the second time in eight years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After a successful coxing career, he dedicated himself to being an assistant coach for the senior squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He gave up countless hours for the development of his peers and all without being paid a cent. In fact, he paid to come away to the regattas to coach while all other adult coaches travelled for free.</p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Official of the Year was awarded to Charlie Brown, a tireless football fan who has been invited to officiate on many occasions by New Zealand Football.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brown</strong> is a qualified level two football official, a level one assistant referee and a level one futsal official.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">These duties have included refereeing at several secondary school tournaments at a national level, where <strong>Brown</strong> has had to apply to take time off school to allow him to do this.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brown</strong> referees school age, women's and men's league football on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>He has also been asked to referee at the national age group federation tournament and national women's games in December.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brown</strong> received mulitple awards for the Whanganui group at the 2017 Central Football Awards for his refereeing and one as a player.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A special mention was made of speed stacker Jasmine Anthony.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She was given a Recognition of Achievement award for her time as a New Zealand representative.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Anthony has maintained her skill for speed stacking for many years and has been selected to represent New Zealand for the past three years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She has competed locally, nationally and internationally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Anthony has maintained national records in the 15-16 female age group, gaining second place overall at the 2017 national sport staking championships and first in the relay.</p>
