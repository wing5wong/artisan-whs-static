<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's Rebecca Baker took out the 1500m-3000m double with classy national-level performances.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was their largest turnout and also the greatest success for the Whanganui contingent at the North Island Secondary Schools Track and Field Championship at Cooks Gardens on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Just over 750 athletes from 11 regions made the trek to the season-ending event, with Whanganui entries on home soil being the third-largest with around 80.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In total, they made the podium 33 times including winning 13 titles, statistically the best performance at the North Island champs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's athletics guru Alec McNab said the locals were particularly strong in the Intermediate Girls events &ndash; winning the 100m, 200m, 400m, 1500m, 3000m and the 4x100m relay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There were 1-2 finishes in both the 200m and 400m.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Collegiate's Genna Maples won the 200m with Tayla Brunger the runnerup, while in the 400m it was Brunger the winner with Emma Osborne coming second.</p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's Rebecca Baker took out the 1500m-3000m double with classy national-level performances.</h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Her 1500m time of 4m 33.73s will move her to second in the New Zealand Under 18 rankings and her 3000m time of 10m 12.56s will place her fourth.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Maples concluded a successful season with Intermediate grade wins in the 100m, 200m and the Long Jump.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her 200m time of 25.11s while running into a 1.7m/s head wind strengthens her position at the top of the New Zealand Under 18 rankings, while her 5.64m long jump closes to within two centimetres of the national leader.</p>
