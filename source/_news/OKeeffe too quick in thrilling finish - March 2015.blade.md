<p>O'Keeffe 'too quick' in thrilling finish.</p>
<p>A WARM morning and a clear river were perfect conditions for the 2015 Bridge to Bridge Open swim yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Multisport Club's annual swim from the Aramoho Rowing Club pontoon to the Union Boat Club ramp attracted 89 entries, an increase on the 74 last year.</p>
<p>They included 36 individuals and five teams swimming the 3km-long course, and 40 entries for the 1km race, which started further down the river by the Dublin St Bridge.</p>
<p>After coming second overall last year, Wanganui Swimming Club member Laura O'Keeffe made it out of the water in 34m 1s, just under three minutes faster than her time in 2014.</p>
<p>"It's nice to get out of the pool and get in the open water," she said.</p>
<p>O'Keeffe was challenged throughout by veteran triathlon competitor Rob Gemmell, snapping at her heels.</p>
<p>"I could feel him behind me a few times, got a few nips.</p>
<p>"But it's good to have someone there to push you."</p>
<p>Gemmell, who opted to race in a wetsuit, was also happy with his 34m 4s effort.</p>
<p>"The river's really clear. I could see her feet well enough to stay on them.</p>
<p>"But she was too quick there at the end - took off on me."</p>
<p>It was a good chance for Wanganui's two latest national representatives to have a dip as Elena Forlong and Shannon Schimanksi, chosen last week for April's Australian Age Group Championships, took part.</p>
<p>Forlong finished third overall in the 3km race.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Second overall was Michael Hiroti in 15m 32s, followed by Blake Hogan just two seconds later.</span></p>
<p>The next event for the club is the Kids Triathlon at the Splash Centre and around Springvale Park this Sunday at 10am.</p>
