2025 is the first year that WHS has participated in the Manawatu Orienteering Championship. We entered 6 teams and each team consisted of 3 students. 

It was a wet and cold day in Palmerston North for the event but that didn't worry our students with our Junior boys of Bruce Mc Gregor, Xavier Brotherton and Alex Payne winning the competition and other teams finishing 4th and 5th. 

Our senior girls team consisting of 1 x year 10 girl and 2 x year 11 girls finished 4th so the future looks good for them. 

Our Senior boys just missed out on winning with Feilding beating them by 1 control to finish 2nd and 3rd. 

Overall a great effort by our students and we will be back next year.
