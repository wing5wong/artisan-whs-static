<p>SAILING AWAY: <strong>Overall Wanganui Schools sailing Regatta winner Jack Southee (WHS)</strong> is flanked portside by third-placed Felix Schrider (WCS) with second-placed Tom Evans (WCS) starboard.</p>
<p>TWO prominent schools shared top&nbsp;honours&nbsp;in the recent annual Wanganui&nbsp;Schools&nbsp;Sailing Regatta, with <strong>Wanganui High School claiming the overall win.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong><br /> <strong>1st - Jack Southee - WHS Laser Class</strong>; 2nd - Tom Evans - WCS Splash Class; 3rd - Felix Schrider - WCS Splash Class</p>
<p>Splash Class:<br /> 1st - Tom Evans - WCS; 2nd - Felix Schrider - WCS.<br /> <strong>Starling Class:</strong> <strong>1st - Jan Hoffmann - WHS; 2nd - Lucy Dowman - WHS.</strong></p>
