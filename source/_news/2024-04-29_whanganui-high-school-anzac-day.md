Anzac day at Pakaitore

During the 28th Maori Battalion Anzac Day service at Pakaitore three of our Maori Prefects, Te Ari Paranihi, Petera Rogers and Kingi Edwards, lay the school wreath at the cenotaph to honour the brave soldiers who have fallen in the many wars and conflicts to protect our freedom.

The occasion was extra special for Kingi, who is a direct descendant of the tipuna on top of the memorial: Herewini Whakarua.

It [](<>)was a very profound moment for the students, their whanau and for the whole school community and we are very proud of the way they represented WHS. A good show of Manaakitanga and Whakawhanaungatanga in which community connections were strengthened and respect was shown towards our Maori akonga and their whanau.

Also present were a good number of student cadets who proudly stood guard, and members of Whanganui Brass who played a solemn note.
