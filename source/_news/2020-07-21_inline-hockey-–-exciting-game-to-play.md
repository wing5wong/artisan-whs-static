New members welcome!

Traditionally, Whanganui used to be very strong in inline hockey. In the early 2000s there were under 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 year olds as well as senior teams, but about eight years ago it had reduced to two senior teams and they are now combined to just one. There is also a Premier Team, which draws players from around Whanganui, some with international experience.

Josh Hamilton, the President of the club and a player in their senior team, puts the decline down, in part, to it being a niche sport with limited exposure. He describes the sport as “like ice hockey but on inline skates. It is an exciting game to play.”

On the weekend of September 5 and 6 there is an opportunity to come and watch from around 9am through to 5pm. The RCP will provide further details once they are available. The games are played at the Jubilee Stadium, Springvale Park.

Practice night is from 7pm to 9pm on a Monday at the Jubilee Stadium. If you are interested in checking the sport out or possibly returning to it, you can just turn up or contact Josh on 022 361 4739 or at wanganuilightningihc@gmail.com.

Teams need a minimum of five skaters and one goalie which gives them one spare but it is preferable to have 8 skaters and 2 goalies so everyone can have a break. The games go for two lots of 20 minutes.

The costs of skates depend on what level the skaters are at. Josh says entry level skates will cost around $200. His skates and those of the experienced skaters can cost between $800 and $1000. You can upgrade as you get more experienced. If you are learning, it will cost $5 for a practice session and $20 for a yearly membership.

Josh has been skating for 22 years and says, “It’s a habit for me. It can be tricky at first but then it is just like riding a bike.” The club has a number of players with similar experience and are more than willing to share their knowledge to newer players and will help make them feel comfortable.

The National Championships take place in New Plymouth at the end of September. Josh says, “Teams from Wellington and Upper Hutt are very strong.”
