<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The winner of the Project Runway NZ series will be decided next week and it could be Kerry Ranginui, former student from Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Auckland-based pattern maker was named one of the top three designers on the penultimate episode of the show on Monday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The challenge, this week was to create a runway look, that gives a taste of the look and feel of the clothing line the designer would create in the final show.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui's choice of acid yellow (he called it chartreuse) lace seemed a highly risky and uncharacteristic one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a calculated risk as it turned out because the beautifully tailored pants and jacket he teamed with a sheer black, ruffle collared blouse looked absolutely stunning on red-haired model Christina Zingel.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">The designer says the look was inspired by "a very ugly time" in his life when he was getting over a difficult break-up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The look represents a transition from darkness to brightness he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It feels amazing to make it to the top three and so surreal that this was the last challenge."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As enthused as the judges were about Ranginui's tailoring and bold colour choice it was competitor Jess Hunter's pink and red leather creation that won the top spot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui's only disappointment on the episode was saying goodbye to his Project Runway roommate Judy Gao.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had been room mates the entire time and every night before we went to sleep, we would talk about the things we wanted to achieve.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She felt like the underdog on the show because of her lack of formal training but I was in awe of her talent."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gao's work on the show has caught the attention of the international fashion elite and she has been invited to show her work at fashion weeks in Paris, London, Milan, New York and Vancouver.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui says it is hard to believe that 11 other contestants have now been eliminated.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He now faces fierce competition for the top prize - a brand-new car, $50,000 cash and six-page spread in&nbsp;<em>Fashion</em>&nbsp;magazine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His main competitor is&nbsp;Benjamin Alexander&nbsp;- a 23-year-old designer from Auckland who appears to be Ranginui's arch nemesis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Kerry thinks he's top dog but he's not," Alexander told the camera in Monday night's episode.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Throughout the series Alexander has grudgingly acknowledged Ranginui's skill and experience while claiming that he has no taste.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Judges loved Alexander's heavily ruffled brown creation on the second to last episode but criticised his lack of finishing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The other member of the top three&nbsp;Jess Hunter&nbsp;also a 23-year-old from Auckland and a retail assistant has proved to be the dark horse of the series.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">She appeared to be melting down in a couple of episodes and did not win any challenges until recently.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now she has come out fighting and told a pouty-faced Alexander that she really believes she can win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The final episode of Project Runway NZ will screen on TVNZ 2 at 7.30pm on Monday December 17.</strong></p>
