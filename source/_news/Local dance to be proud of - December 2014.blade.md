<p>STRONGER: &nbsp;Former WHS student Amelia Chandulal-Mackay just before leaving for Sydney late last year.</p>
<p>JOAN<br />I took my granddaughter to see the Royal New Zealand Ballet's production of&nbsp;<em>A Christmas Carol</em>&nbsp;at the Aotea Centre, Auckland. It was a well presented and enjoyable show. I took Mike to see Wanganui Ballet and Dance Academy's end of year production at the Prince Edward Auditorium and it was fantastic!<br />Both events saw families arrive full of anticipation, young girls dressed in their best and an air of expectation. In Whanganui was the added, justified sense of pride as mums and dads, siblings and grandparents were there to recognise their own. I was an objective spectator and was delighted by it all. Anna Chandulal, the show's director and her fellow teacher, Rebecca Marshall show so much of their own knowledge and ability while showcasing the well-honed talent and commitment of their many pupils of varying ages.<br />Using two short, zany stories as background plus a section of individual performances between, all pupils over the age of four took part. Everyone knew their work, everyone smiled and involved their audience. The love of what they were doing added to an obviously well-taught self-discipline made for stunning entertainment, fun and exquisite moments.<br />The support of parents was evident. Costumes and props were so visual. The choreography suited the achievement level of each performer and moulded into a seamless whole. Congratulations to each participant.<br />Special for me were Josh Chandulal-Mackay, for his agility, timing and energy, Flynn Rees, Annalise Smith, Jezelle Bidois and Trinity Taylor-Moore for their excellent characterisation and dance, Connor Jenkins for his developing skill, Mikayla Baldwin for her delicacy and Annabel McMahon for being one of those special people with that extra quality that glues your eyes to her performance.<br />I love dance and have seen much over the years.</p>
<p>What a thrill to watch Amelia Chandulal-Mackay perform again! A graduate of the school, Amelia has returned from a year's training at Ecole Ballet School in Sydney. She has become stronger in physique, even more ambitious in achievement and glorious to watch. She could easily hold her own alongside the professional dancers I saw recently in Auckland. Amelia intends further training in northern climes. We shall soon be claiming her as our own as, with great humility, she goes on to greatness.</p>
