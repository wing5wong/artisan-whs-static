<p>Dear Jack and Whanganui High School Team Members, Nusr and Mikaya&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Congratulations &ndash; your Bullying-Free NZ Week competition entry has won <strong>First Prize in the Senior Short Film Category.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>We were inundated with entries - the standard was very high.&nbsp; When considering the entries, the judging panel looked at the simplicity, clarity and impact of the message, the students&rsquo; understanding of bullying behaviour, and the originality of their approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of the competition was to raise awareness of the issue of bullying and the need for everyone - boards of trustees, school staff, students, whānau and communities - to work together to prevent bullying behaviour.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s theme was <em>&lsquo;NZ students with solutions - working together to end bullying&rsquo;</em>, acknowledging the importance of listening to students&rsquo; voices and experiences.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The judges agreed your entry was an outstanding short film with a clear, positive and uplifting message.&nbsp; The film took a refreshing approach, led by student voices, and produced to a high, professional standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the competition rules, the award-winning schools will receive $500 (due for payment into the school&rsquo;s bank account approx 29 June) and a Bullying-Free NZ Award Certificate.&nbsp; Individual certificates for participating team members can also be provided &ndash; just let us know how many you would like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A selection of the winning entries will be published on <a href="http://www.bullyingfree.nz">www.bullyingfree.nz</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Once again, congratulations <strong>Jack Southee, Nusr Ghamri and Mikaya Teki&nbsp;</strong>on your win and thank you for sending in your excellent entry.</strong></p>
<p>Kind Regards<br />Kim Hailwood/Senior Advisor<br />Ministry of Education</p>
