<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui cyclist Jack Overweel had great success at the Vantage Age Group Track Cycling Nationals held in Cambridge last weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Representing West Coast North Island (WCNI), Overweel won gold in the under 15 boys' derby race, beating several Waikato and Southland riders.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>During the four-day competition, Overweel also took silver in the U15 Boys' 500m Time Trial (TT), where he broke the WCNI's indoor track record of 36.740s, set by Thomas Garnett in 2014.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>He took another silver in the 7.5km points race, winning the first two sprints ahead of Waikato's Hamish Banks and Southland's Marshall Erwood.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Overweel teamed with Lochlan Foote to get silver in the 500m TT team event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They, and the winning Waikato-Bay of Plenty team, went under the previous national record of 37.002s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was part of a 30-rider WCNI group, consisting of representatives from Whanganui, Feilding, Manawatu, Taranaki, and Levin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In her report, spokeswoman Mellissa Hunt said this season Overweel had beaten two of the records set by 2016 junior world champion Campbell Stewart on the Feilding track.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He beat the 500m TT mark of 38.8s, bringing it down to 37.08s, as well as the 200m sprint record from 2012 of 13.89s, with Overweel doing it in 13.04s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jack continues to defy odds against those that train on the two indoor velodromes in New Zealand, and his one wish is to get a roof on the Whanganui one so he can be on par with his competitors from both Cambridge and Southland," said Hunt.</p>
