Eddie Dewhirst WHS Year 12 has finished a very strong 8th in the Yachting NZ youth champs held in Auckland last weekend in difficult strong winds.

This competition is a world championship selection event, for under 19s.

The competition is between all of the top junior sailors in NZ who sail the ILCA 6 (Laser) boat, which is the same boat international sailors Ben Ainslie and Tom Slingsby competed in at the Olympics, before going on to Americas Cup and SailGP. The ILCA/Laser is the boat [](<>)many top professional sailors start their careers in.

Well done Eddie!
