<h4>This year saw a different competition for Stage Challenge and a very short time frame to construct a winning worthy performance. This year we tackled the mis treatment of children in Lake Alice.</h4>
<h4>On Friday 31 August we took 81 performers and 13 crew to Palmerston North to compete in the Regional Stage Art competition with 'Uncovering Alice' and came away with 1st place!!!</h4>
<p>Our point of difference was our stunning videography projected behind our performance.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations to our whole team who worked incredibly hard and gave a standout performance.</strong></p>
