<p>A group of Wanganui High School students, teachers and parent helpers on a Hut working bee.</p>
<p>Back in the 1960s the Tongariro Parks Board wanted to expand the number of huts in the Park.&nbsp; Wanganui High School accepted the challenge.&nbsp; It took a year to build their hut, it cost only $490 and was opened in October 1965.&nbsp; On opening night, nearly 100 stayed overnight in the hut and in nine tents.&nbsp; This Sunday, October 31, the school is inviting &ldquo;all past and present WHS trampers, Duke of Edinburgh students, parents and staff&rdquo; to meet at the hut to celebrate the 50<sup>th</sup> milestone.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The hut was named after chemistry teacher Mr R Lupton, a keen tramper who donated the wood from his Bastia Hill property.&nbsp; Mr Brian Phillips, a builder donated his services as well and the army took the timber up to where the track begins.&nbsp; Volunteers carried all the bricks, cement and hard board by hand to the site, which normally takes around 90 minutes to tramp into.&nbsp; The hard work continues today.&nbsp; Pitzac donates firewood and volunteers carry it into the hut.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>DOC has helped as well.&nbsp; They dropped in by helicopter a 3,000 litre tank eight years ago, when the long drop was replaced by a more up to date toilet.&nbsp; However, as ex teacher and keen tramper Terry O&rsquo;Connor told the RCP, &ldquo;the students had to dig the huge hole first&rdquo;.&nbsp; DOC also provided a water tank and outdoor hand basin.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Terry&rsquo;s wife Claire is the teacher in charge of the Duke of Edinburgh scheme at the school and says that the hut is used mainly for teaching bush-craft skills.&nbsp; It is a great location, she says, for the &ldquo;newbies&rdquo; as a learner&rsquo;s trip as it contains some good up and down tramping as well as a bit of bolder hopping.&nbsp; The hut is on the ridge of the bush line and can get heavy snowfalls.&nbsp; Terry says that many students have never been to the snow.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Strictly speaking the hut is really an eight sleeper but it all depends how close you want to get.&nbsp; There is a wood burner but gas cookers are used for cooking.&nbsp; Terry and Claire believe that it is the only school tramping hut on Tongariro and it is used by other school and community groups.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
