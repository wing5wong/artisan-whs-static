The Wynne Costley Scholarship is awarded by the Wanganui Branch of the National Council of women. Students from Whanganui can enter a research essay on a New Zealand woman or New Zealand women in society, past or present, living or dead, who have or who are still achieving and contributing in a distinctly definable way to society.

This year Whanganui High School students wrote wonderful essays about a variety of fascinating women. On Monday 19 October our students attended an event at the Grant Hotel where all participants were asked to give a short speech about the women they had chosen and why they had inspired the students. It was very interesting to hear about the women of New Zealand who have all been pioneers in one way or another. Sophia Bedwell (Y10) wrote about Julie Campbell (founder and CEO of KidsCan), **Olivia Bedwell won the Y11 competition** with an essay about Dame Whina Cooper. In Y12 Kera Forrest wrote about the contribution of New Zealand women during WWI. The Y13s had an eclectic mix of topics with Ranita Kirk’s examination of the life of Suzanne Aubert who became the ‘Mother Theresa of New Zealand’ in the 19th Century, while Lily Smith researched female spes during WWII. **Jordan Clear** writing about Dame Whina Cooper and **Merle Chant** with her essay on Georgina Beyer both achieved a **Highly Commended**. The **winner of the Y13 Competition and Overall winner was Aranga Molijn** with her impeccably researched essay about Te Puea Herangi.**

It is wonderful to see our students extending themselves beyond the curriculum to acknowledge and honour the contribution of others to our society. Grateful thanks to the Whanganui Branch of the National Council of Women for this opportunity.
