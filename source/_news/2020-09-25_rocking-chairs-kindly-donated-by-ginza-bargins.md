Whanganui High School Learning Support Centre and students would like to thank Brent Huijs of Ginza Bargains (54 Maria Place Extension) for their recent generous donation of two rocking chairs to the Learning Support Centre.  

The rocking chairs are ideal to help soothe anxiety and tension for some of our students with special learning needs.  

The Ginza Bargains staff were most helpful and supportive, showing us the wide range of possibilities that could meet our requirements within their furniture range.  

Whanganui High School is very appreciative of their support.
