A Whanganui model agency is holding a workshop next month with nationally recognised mentors.

The Embrace Model Management workshop will cover hair care and skincare, dance and exercise, walking runway and photoshoots, and fashion and dressing for your body, on Sunday, April 18.

The agency was created by Carla Jayne Smith about four years ago on her return to Whanganui from Australia.

Organiser Carol Hayward said the goal of Embrace was to build confidence and self-esteem for our youth.

Nationally recognised stylists **Kerry Ranginui** and Jo Mickelborough will be joining Hayward for the workshop.

With more than 25 years as a fashion stylist, Mickelborough is a model scout and development coach for Red 11 Management, one of the biggest agencies in New Zealand.

The Whanganui-born **Ranginui**, a fashion designer and creative celebrity, has worked alongside the likes of NZ fashion design royalty Karen Walker.

Hayward said to have these two available to locals was a wonderful opportunity.

"We have created quite the package for those interested. It is a supportive and nurturing environment.

"It's a huge thing for a 13-year-old to come and do this. We just want to support them as best we can. The main goal is for them to have fun and come away with confidence."

Hayward said they had opened up the age bracket to allow older participants to come along.

"It just became more apparent that we might want to open up the age."

There is a $100 fee to attend the workshops, and every entrant goes into the draw to see world-famous dance group The Royal Family, led by Parris Goebel.

"I just thought it was time to put my money where my mouth is. This is a girl that started from the bottom and now is on the world stage, she is an inspiration and shows what is possible," Hayward said.

The workshop takes place at Ngā Tai o te Awa at 142 Guyton St. For more information and to sign up for the workshop, go to [Embrace Model Management's Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/embracemodels/)
