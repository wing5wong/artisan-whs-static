There were dozens of eggs being cracked last week in honour of UCOL Whanganui’s annual NZ Chefs cooking competitions. There were eggs in omelettes, cupcakes, sandwiches and pasta. 

Whanganui High School sent in its crack omelette making team of Kelahn Te Awhe, Alysha Nuku-Makatea, Britney Walsh and Ava Fitzpatrick to the hot kitchen class. The omelettes had to contain a Woodhaven Gardens vegetable and were produced by a team of two making two flat and two folded omelette dishes in 30 minutes; so Kelahn and Alysha made fennel, spring onion and chorizo served with an orange emulsion folded and spinach, ricotta and lemon and raspberry curd open. Britney and Ava made a beetroot, radish, spring onion and raspberry folded omelette served with raspberry curd and a leek, broccoli, pancetta and blue cheese open omelettes. 

**The teams took Gold and Silver and won the class.**

Cupcakes are always a popular static event. 

Whanganui High School entered six different cupcakes. This year we chose to make a salted caramel and chocolate with a spun sugar decoration, a black forest chocolate and cherry, a tea in the rose garden with Earl Grey tea flavour and rose petal jam, a blackberry and coconut, a hot cakes cake and a raspberry lemonade flavour. We took one **Gold** for the raspberry lemonade by Ava Fitzpatrick, **Silvers** for the salted caramel by Kelahn Te Awhe, Black forest by Britney Walsh, Tea in the Rose Garden by Caitlyn Butlin and **Bronze** for hot cakes by Alysha Nuku-Makatea and Blackberry and coconut by Olea Drummond.
