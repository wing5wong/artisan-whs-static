<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Around 30 members of the RSA women's section spent Wednesday morning binding more than 2000 poppies to sprigs of rosemary.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Long before the wreaths are laid and the rum and coffee poured at Thursday morning's Anzac Day dawn service, volunteers spend hours making sure the show runs smoothly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a lot of work getting days like Anzac Day ready," Returned and Services Association (RSA) Whanganui support advisor Wally Wallbutton says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following the tradition of years gone by, around 30 members of the RSA women's section spent Wednesday morning binding more than 2000 poppies to sprigs of rosemary.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The dressed poppies were then placed at the graves of ex-servicemen and woman at Aramoho Cemetery.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">"Part of being a cadet is helping with the cleaning graves and setting of poppies to remember those who lost, and risked their lives for New Zealand," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Whanganui City College military services academy director Patrick Cooney says it's important youth are involved in Anzac Day and that the older generation continues to educate them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If young people are not engaged with this now, as a legacy it gets forgotten."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year marks the first Anzac Day ceremony since the RSA and Cosmopolitan Club merged into one location at Club Metro on Ridgway St and Wanganui RSA president Geoff Chowles says there's been a big effort from volunteers this year to make it come together.</p>
<p>"Anzac Day is obviously a very big part of our calendar, a lot of work goes into it from our organising committee, and from those helping with poppies, food, and the ceremony itself," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've always commemorated Anzac Day together so this year there won't be much change, we'll all just be in a different building."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although Anzac Day commemorations are brought together every year, more help is always appreciated.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We need lots of volunteers to continue helping out because the RSA is no longer a trading organisation, we're the RSA Whanganui Welfare Trust, which means we're run by volunteers, we're a charity, and our aim is to help ex-servicemen and current servicemen with whatever their needs may be."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's dawn parade assembles outside Davis Library at 5.10am, followed by a march to the War Memorial Centre where the ceremony will begin at 5.30am.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This is followed by hot drinks after the service. Breakfast will then be available at Club Metro.</p>
