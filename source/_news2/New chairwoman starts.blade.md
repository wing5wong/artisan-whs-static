<p data-bind="text: $data">Since 2014 Gillian Tasker has chaired the Literary Festival Trust through two festivals. Now she is stepping down and (former WHS teacher) Mary-Ann Ewing is taking her place for this year&rsquo;s September / October event.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gillian now works in Palmerston North as their council&rsquo;s arts co-ordinator. She commutes each day.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t leave me much time, particularly for meetings, and also I realise that now I have more contact with the Palmerston North community than the Whanganui one these days,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And I think it&rsquo;s refreshing that new people take a turn at leading.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The trust was set up in 2006 with Joan Rosier-Jones as chairwoman. Joan stepped down in 2014.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;It was Joan&rsquo;s baby,&rdquo; says Gillian. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve got to keep it alive, healthy and happy and watch it grow.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Joan is now patron of the Literary Festival Trust.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We love the fact that she provides us with guidance, because she knows so much and her experience is huge.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Literary Festival is a biennial event in which invited authors talk about their work and writing in general. It&rsquo;s an opportunity for readers to see their writers up close and engage them in conversation.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">A special guest this year is Corey Mosen and his famous kea dog, Ajax.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very fortunate with the other groups that come on board to assist and volunteer, like Repertory Theatre which stages an associated play, and the Sarjeant which hosted a book launch, which was a happy coincidence,&rdquo; says Gillian.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Gillian resigned in early November and Mary-Ann acknowledges the huge amount of work she contributed over the past two festivals.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m consulting with Gillian a lot and I know I have big shoes to fill.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I see the role as overseeing the committee, a really hard working team, and by the end we&rsquo;re meeting every week with September 28 to October 6 in mind. It&rsquo;s organising everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She says previous festivals have opened her eyes to what a good team they have. &ldquo;When the festival itself starts you&rsquo;ve got this huge body of volunteers who all just pitch in. It&rsquo;s very much a team effort,&rdquo; says Gillian. &ldquo;The chairperson is just one member of the team but is the face of it, so it&rsquo;s important you are known in the community and can stand up and talk on behalf of the trust. During the festival you&rsquo;re there to help the rest of the team and ensure the timetable is adhered to.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The former chairwoman, although no longer on the trust, will still make herself available to help.</p>
