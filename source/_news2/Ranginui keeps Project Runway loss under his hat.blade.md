<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerry Ranginui has known for six months that he is not the winner of the first&nbsp;<em>Project Runway</em>&nbsp;NZ series and he has had to keep it under his stylish hat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hometown supporters saw him lose out to Auckland contestant Benjamin Alexander when the final episode screened on Monday night but in real time he is well over his disappointment.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great fun and I would do it all again if I had the chance. I made great friends and the show challenged me to try new things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So was Alexander really as hostile towards Ranginui as he seemed to be on the screen?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yes, he was and right from the start he refused to give me the time of day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was quite hard sharing an apartment with him but I had a feeling he would win because the judges praised his work from the beginning."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui says he came in for some harsh criticism from the judges both on and off camera.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They always praised my finishing but didn't seem to like my ideas and they overlooked poor finishing in other contestants' work."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As a pattern maker with a decade of experience in the fashion industry, Ranginui seemed a dead-cert to win the series but his background possibly made the judges more critical of his work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His collection for the final episode was inspired by the song&nbsp;<em>Send in the Clowns</em>and featured ruffle collared blouses with tailored suits that impressed the judges but not as much as Alexander's khaki collection or runner-up Jess Hunter's confectionery colours.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Guest judge, stylist Kylie Cooke told Ranginui that she could imagine one of his jackets hanging in her wardrobe 10 years from now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He liked that and says he is happy that he is creating classic garments even if they didn't wow the judges.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The other guest judge was Taranaki boy Sean Kelly who won the US version of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway</em>&nbsp;in 2014.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Alexander's prize is a new car, $50,000 cash and a six-page spread in&nbsp;<em>Fashion Quarterly</em>&nbsp;magazine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui watched the screening of the final episode with&nbsp;<em>Project Runway</em>&nbsp;friends including fellow contestants Lenon Wakauwa, Judy Gao and models from the series.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wore the chartreuse outfit from my collection to celebrate," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He did have to substitute another pair of pants because the ones made for leggy model Christina Zingel were not suitable.</p>
