<p><span>TRANSTASMAN TRIUMPH: Whanganui's judo brothers Callaghan (left) and Keightley Watson won medals at the ACT International Judo tournament recently. Here they are joined by Mark Brewer, the Sydney-based member of the New Zealand OJU Continental Cup team, who coached the Watsons in Canberra.</span></p>
<p>WHANGANUI judo siblings Keightley and Callaghan Watson have just returned from a successful raid of Australian gold and silver.</p>
<p>The Wanganui Judo Club brothers were competing for New Zealand at the two-day ACT International Judo Tournament in Tuggeranong, on the outskirts of Canberra.</p>
<p>Father Ross Watson said the international meet was Australia's second biggest judo championships behind their nationals, which were not open to Kiwi fighters.</p>
<p><strong>WHS student Keightley Watson, 14, now competing in the cadet boys 90+kg division, came up against some strong opposition in his weight group, but went through the competition unbeaten to take gold.</strong></p>
<p>Ten-year-old Callaghan Watson, who won silver at the Sydney International last September, backed that up with another silver in the junior boys 50+kg division.</p>
<p>Both fighters were fortunate to have the coaching services of Mark Brewer, a current member of the New Zealand Oceania Judo Union (OJU) team who now lives in Sydney.</p>
<p>The brothers will now focus on the upcoming New Zealand area tournaments in preparation for the 2016 Sydney International, to be held at Olympic Park in September.</p>
<p>They will be joined by older cousin Casey Watson, who will fight in the cadet boys under 81kg grade.</p>
