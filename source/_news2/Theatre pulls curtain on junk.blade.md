<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Repertory Theatre performers are spending almost as much time cleaning up as they are rehearsing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Ringing Changes,</em>&nbsp;written and directed by Ted Charlton, starts in July and president Phil Hudson decided it was time to remove some clutter from the theatre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ex-president Phil Portland got on board, along with enthusiastic theatre youngsters Ella Chapman, Meynell Smith, Reid Tucker and Reuben Janes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've got wood for miles. When things have been collected for nearly a hundred years like this, you've got to decide what to keep and what to get rid of," Portland said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've got some real dedicated young people here coming in and doing the hard work. This is the unglamorous side of theatre, but it's stuff that has got to be done."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Most of what is being sorted through are old props and building materials that have been shoved into holes or under the stage, anywhere they can fit.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Perhaps the most interesting thing found during the clean-up of the Ridgway St building is a set of old doors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We pulled them out and we're definitely not throwing them away because we're looking at them thinking they might be the original doors of the building," Portland said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The outside of the theatre has changed over the years, it was a library before it was the theatre, it's over 100 years old. Hopefully we can do the doors up and use them for something at some point."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Portland said the young performers getting involved in the clean-up made him proud.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Young Reuben, we've watched him grow up, he has come through the theatre ranks and he is going to be on stage in this next performance.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We call ourselves the theatre family, it really does have that feel and it makes me really proud to know that as a theatre community, we have done enough to get these young people giving back."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The building has been a theatre since 1933 and Portland said that like many older buildings it has some issues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are the caretakers of the theatre, so really it's our duty to make sure we're keeping the place clean and tidy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We need to sort out some issues and we are in the process of raising funds to upgrade and keep ourselves current."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Ringing Changes</em>&nbsp;will run on July 5, 6, 7, 12, 13 and 14 in the Wanganui Repertory&nbsp;</p>
