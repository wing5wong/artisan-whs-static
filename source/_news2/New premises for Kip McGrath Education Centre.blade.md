<p>Owner, Caroline Burrows, former WHS teacher.</p>
<p><span><br />The Whanganui Kip McGrath Education Centre is now based in purpose-built new premises at 28 Somerset Road, Springvale and everyone including students, staff and parents is enjoying the advantages of the new location.</span></p>
<p><span>The old Centre was on the third floor of an old building in Guyton Street and leaks, drafts and other building related issues became too frustrating. Owner, Caroline Burrows, looked at othe</span><span class="text_exposed_show">r places to rent but decided to build a purpose-built Centre instead.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">She chose Springvale because the location is so convenient as it is close, not only to a variety of schools (St Johns, Carlton, Faith City, WIS, High School and Collegiate), but is also close to Springvale Park, the Garden Centre and Caf&eacute; as well as the Splash Centre, which parents and siblings can take advantage of if they wish to do so.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Access is good, there is plenty of free parking as well as bike stands. The training room is large enough to have seven groups working at the same time with ample computers throughout. The rooms are quiet, dry and warm.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Caroline has seen a significant increase in numbers since she took over the franchise in 2015. Starting with about 60 students, the Centre now caters for 170+. They have small groups of up to four students, each with a qualified teacher. Most study English and Maths from year 1 to 13 but they do offer senior science (years 11 to 13) and some adult education opportunities as well. All are on individual programmes tailored to the level and requirements of the student.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Lessons are for 80 minutes and are available from 3.40pm to 5pm and 5.20pm to 6.40pm, Mondays to Fridays and on Saturday mornings from 10.30 to 11.50am.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Caroline can be contacted on 348 0035.</span></p>
