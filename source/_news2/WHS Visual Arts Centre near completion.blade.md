<p>Whanganui High School's new Visual Arts Centre blends in with the rest of the school buildings and classrooms on site.&nbsp; It is expected to be completed next Thursday.</p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Work on the redesigned, visual arts centre at Whanganui High School is scheduled to be completed on 14 December. Of course the students will have left by then but they will return next year to experience the purpose-built classrooms and even a gallery space to display their works. </span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Construction was delayed a bit because the centre is right next to the hall where NCEA exams have been taking place. During the renovations the original staff room was uncovered including the 60 year old wallpaper. </span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The rooms will have lots of light and have been redesigned to recognize changes in the art curriculum with the use of computers. There are five teachers working in the Visual Arts including teachers focusing on photography or technology. Principal, Martin McEllen says, &ldquo;they are all practising artists in their own right.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">The Visual Arts play an important role at High School. Martin says, &ldquo;I am keen and passionate about providing students with wide educational choices. To me and the school, the visual arts are really important. They help to enrich learning and are great subjects to study.&rdquo; While the visual arts might not necessarily lead to a job they show the student has been involved in the creative process, which is important for many jobs in the future.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Martin says, &ldquo;we have really good teachers in this field and top class students. We had two entries in the prestigious nationwide Wallace Art Awards for Secondary school studies with the one from Toka Poa winning it.&rdquo; Toka Poa also won The Principal&rsquo;s Cup for Excellence in Arts.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
