<p class="element element-paragraph">The 2018 edition of the Bush Riders' Motorcycle Club's Central Cross-country Series is up and running and it was Whanganui's Seth Reardon (former WHS student) who was the fastest man out of the blocks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The annual five-round off-road motorcycle series kicked off near Waipukurau on Sunday with a huge assembly of New Zealand's leading motocross, cross-country and enduro racers on the 79-rider start line, but it was Reardon and his 2019-model Yamaha YZ250FX bike who stole the show, winning the two-hour senior race by 40 seconds from Glen Murray's Sam Brown (KTM 450XC-F), with Taupo's Nathan Tesselaar (KTM 350 XC-F), Pahiatua's Charles Alabaster (Suzuki RM-Z450) and Eketahuna's Charlie Richardson (Husqvarna FE250) rounding out the top five.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Masterton man Allan Gannon (Honda CRF450) , who was outright winner of the series last season, had to settle for 11th overall on Sunday, behind Dannevirke's Ben Paterson (Yamaha WRF250) and just ahead of Palmerston North's James Galpin (KTM 250XC-F).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Feilding's Hugh Lintott (Yamaha YZ450FX), entered as an "over-45 years mega veteran" class rider, was best of the intermediate grade contestants, finishing the day a creditable eighth overall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really gelled with the track. It was fast but I liked it," said race winner Reardon, a 20-year-old apprentice engineer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't get a great start ... I was about eighth into the first corner. But I was up to second position during that opening lap, just behind the leader, Charles Alabaster.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I passed Charles on lap two and then opened up a bit of a gap over him, which I maintained until the finish. My dad was acting as my pit crew and he told me I could ease up a bit near the end and just cruise to the finish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It really looked like a track that would favour the bigger 350cc and 450cc bike riders, but I had my bike screaming and that was obviously fast enough.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have been getting better and better each time I ride and I think that's because of all the training I have been doing. I go to the gym three or four times a week and ride as much as I can at the Whanganui club's motocross track."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Winner of the 90-minute junior race that was held earlier in the day was Eltham's Adam Loveridge (Husqvarna TC125), finishing ahead of Napier's Bryn Codd (Yamaha YZ125) and Masterton's Joe Falloon (Yamaha YZ144).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The riders now rest up and prepare for round two of the series, at Woodville on December 16.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was an extremely busy and productive weekend for Reardon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Saturday he raced his way to fifth overall (and second in class) at the fifth round of six in the Yamaha NZXC Series in the Riverhead Forest, west of Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That wasn't a bad day for me either," he said. "I always want to win, but I can't complain with that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had a few crashes in the mud, but nothing major. I guess if you don't crash now and again you're just not trying hard enough eh?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Also, a big lump of mud was knocked into the tank when I pitted for fuel and I thought it was all over for me. I crossed my fingers and decided just to press on. The bike lasted the whole race and I cleaned out the fuel tank before Sunday's race."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The next round of the NZXC Series is set for Waimiha, in the King Country, on December 8.</p>
