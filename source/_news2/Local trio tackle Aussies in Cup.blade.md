<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Three Whanganui skaters are in the New Zealand line-up to help even the score in the biennial Trans-Tasman Cup test series with Australia later this week.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The three test series is being played in Gympie, Queensland this year with four grades competing - under-17, senior men, masters and veterans.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Under17 national coach Carlin Barry, who also plays for the senior men, is joined by fellow Whanganui skaters <strong>Jimi Blinkhorne and Brodie Hurndell, both Whanganui High School students.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Blinkhorne</strong> <strong>is the under-17 captain, but has also gained selection to the senior men's team,</strong> while <strong>Hurndell</strong> is sporting a possible fractured wrist and unlikely to see game time with the under-17 side.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Brodie is unlikely to play, but had already booked and paid for his tickets, so he'll probably be the orange boy," Barry said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jimi is an old hand having played in the under-17 team since the Trans-Tasman Cup began a couple of years ago. The test series used to be an annual event, but has just changed to biennial because of the world championships next year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"Jimi's form and performances at our trails in New Plymouth were good enough for him to be selected for the senior men's team too.</strong> He probably doesn't think he's going to get much game time with the men, but I think he will get far more than he thinks."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Barry said there was fortunately several hours between the different grade match-ups allowing Blinkhorne recovery time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It will also be good for me and give me time to get my head around coaching the kids, while also playing for the seniors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Aussies are probably one ahead of us in the under-17, men and veteran grades, although we are very evenly matched, while our masters have a clean winning record over them," Barry said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealand teams flew out of Wellington early this morning with games scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>
