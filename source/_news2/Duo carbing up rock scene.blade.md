<p class="element element-paragraph">A fledgling music career is taking former Whanganui man James Stuteley off on a tour of Australia this week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Stuteley, one half of the band Carb on Carb, got interested in music when his sister Stephanie played in bands around Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>At Whanganui High School there were musical friends and supportive teachers and he entered the annual Smokefree Rockquest four times.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His first instrument was the guitar, but he now plays drums in Carb on Carb while partner Nicole Gaffney plays guitar and sings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been good changing and learning a new instrument. It means that I get to let loose behind the drums a bit," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He and Gaffney formed Carb on Carb in Wellington in 2012. Stuteley is a vegetarian and the name relates to food they like to eat &mdash; "like potatoes on pasta".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The two soon moved to Auckland and they have released two albums &mdash; Carb on Carb, with their second album For Ages released in May. Both are on the Australian Black Wire Records label.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band has reached number 11 on the New Zealand artists music chart and toured New Zealand, Australia, the United States, China and southeast Asia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This week they head for shows in Brisbane, Sydney and Canberra, and after that they play at The Others Way festival in Auckland.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Australia is one of their favourite countries to perform in &mdash; "Australia has been really good to us; we get good audiences and do really well," Stuteley said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their most popular single is It's Been A Rough Year, which relates to what they and their friends went through in 2016.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Stuteley is the band's manager, searching out performance opportunities, getting recommendations and responding to invitations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their musical style was first labelled indie rock, but they call it emo &mdash; emotional rock music. It comes naturally to Stuteley.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I used to play less emotional music, but I have found emotional music is more satisfying. It's more than nice background and a happy-sounding song. There's more to connect to."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He and Gaffney write their songs together, and Gaffney also leads Girls Rock Aotearoa, a week-long musical camp for young people.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The pair make enough money from their music for a part-time income but have to find work between tours. They would like to make a fulltime living from their music, but Stuteley said "only on our own terms".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're pretty happy doing it as a part-time thing."</p>
