<p><span>IT ADDS UP: Jo Redpath, Connor Cresswell and Alan Wong are the top regional team.</span></p>
<p>The key number for three Wanganui High School maths whizkids is ONE - as they took away the first place in the regional Massey Manawatu Maths and Stats (M3S) competition last week.</p>
<p>Jo Redpath, Connor Cresswell and Alan Wong beat 20 other teams from the region by correctly answering 23 out of 35 increasingly difficult questions.</p>
<p>The competition was organised by the mathematics and statistics group in the Institute of Fundamental Sciences, as a way to engage students with mathematics and statistics through fun and challenging problems.</p>
<p>Winning team member Connor Cresswell said the hardest part of the competition was timing.</p>
<p>"Knowing when to pass was really important because we only had an hour, so we had to time it right."</p>
<p>Tutor in statistics Anne Lawrence says she is delighted to see the event grow from 16 schools last year to 21 this year.</p>
<p>"Last year the students and their teachers clearly enjoyed the challenge of solving our problems.</p>
<p>"There is quite a bit for them to get their heads around in terms of working as a team, deciding how long to struggle with a particular question and, of course, applying their mathematical and statistical thinking to tackle the problems."</p>
<p>Director of the mathematics in industry group at Massey University, Professor Emeritus Graeme Wake, said mathematical skills are applicable now, more than ever.</p>
<p>"Many industry and community problems can benefit from a mathematical or statistical approach.</p>
<p>"Worldwide, countries have discovered that mathematics is a high-tech thing that can add value to their enterprise. Mathematics is everywhere and can underpin everything - this is something not everyone appreciates."</p>
