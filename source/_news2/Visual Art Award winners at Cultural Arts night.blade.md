<p><span><span><strong>The Head Family Trophy for Dedication to Photography</strong>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>&ldquo;To me, photography is an art of observation. It&rsquo;s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place&hellip; I&rsquo;ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.&rdquo;</span><br /><span>&mdash; Elliott Erwitt</span><br /><span>This student seems to look through the viewfinder and, time after time, has proven themselves to be a naturally gift</span><span class="text_exposed_show">ed photographer. They have a clear vision for development of their ideas, consistently achieved top results and have independently created a sophisticated series of work over the past two years.&nbsp;<br />They demonstrate a high level of creativity, commitment and perseverance in all aspects of photography.<br />This student is a passionate learner, who challenges themselves to pursue their own excellence.<br /><strong>This is a well-deserved accolade for Meghan Price.</strong></span></span></p>
