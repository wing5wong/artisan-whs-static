<p data-bind="text: $data">Wanganui has provided some fine loose forwards over the past half century and the union has lost one of them with the sudden death of 68-year-old Ray Stafford in Waipukurau last week.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Ray Stafford, the tall sideranker, again captained the side and set a good example to his pack with his driving play&rdquo; was the way the NZ Rugby Almanac summed up his play in 1978 when Wanganui was third in the North Island Div 2 championship.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The following season he was described as &ldquo;a tireless loose forward and energetic chaser of the ball&rdquo; and in 1980 he was &ldquo;always energetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ray played 80 times for Wanganui in 1971 and between 1976 and 1981. He played in the Waikato between 1972-1975. From Marton he went farming in Wangamomona and then to Hawke&rsquo;s Bay.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He played in two Wanganui Ranfurly Shield challenges &mdash; against Auckland in 1976 (lost 9-16) and Manawatu (beaten 26-9) the following season.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ray was one of nine local players in the Wanganui-King Country combined team beaten 60-9 by the 1977 British Lions at Taumarunui and repped for Wanganui in a 9-45 loss to the 1981 Springboks at Spriggens Park.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">He scored 14 tries for Wanganui and kicked four penalty goals and two conversions and was in the local teams that beat the touring 1980 Fijians 16-11 and NZ Colts 19-13 in 1978.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">There were also local matches against New South Wales (lost 0-17) and Australia (lost 3-8) in 1978, NZ Juniors (lost 9-28) in 1979 and New South Wales again (lost 6-25) in 1980.</p>
