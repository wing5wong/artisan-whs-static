<p class="element element-paragraph">A $34,446 grant from the New Zealand Community Trust (NZCT) will help lay foundations for the future of athletes at Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The funding will be used to help students pay for travel and accommodation when they go away during summer tournament week at the end of March.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It will also be used to pay sports performance pathways coach Greg Fromont, who has been in the role since it was created at Whanganui High School in 2016.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fromont got on board after receiving a phone call from director of sport at WHS Lisa Murphy, who described to him her vision for a new programme at the school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Murphy said when she arrived at the Purnell St school in 2015, she identified many great athletes and wanted to ensure they were always fit and conditioned.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're trying to get the fundamentals in our kids from Year 9, making sure their movement skills are all good and they know what to do.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Greg's a professional coach so he knew exactly what we needed for the kids and we put the programme together. It wouldn't be where it is today without Greg."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fromont is employed part-time and spends most of that time training the students after school to prepare them for competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Two students who were there at the beginning of the programme are Rebecca Baker and Travis Bayler.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Murphy said they are proof of the programme's success.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our head girl Rebecca Baker is a very good hockey player, she does athletics, she does cross country and she's our very first sports performance pathway kid.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Her and Travis Bayler started it with Greg when they were young and you can see how they've developed. Travis won a national title last year at athletics."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Baker won the women's section of the Manawatu/Whanganui Centre Championships on Tuesday running 3000m in 10:07.43.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS were also able to secure funding from KiwiSport to pay Baker's mum Elaine who also helps with after-school training as an assistant coach.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During tournament week students will travel to Karapiro to row at the Maadi Cup, boys and girls will travel to Gisborne for softball and Palmerston North for volleyball.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The next big sports event for Whanganui High School is the house athletics at Cooks Gardens on Thursday, February 21.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is the second year of house competition since house groups were re-established at the school and will be good preparation for the North Island Secondary Schools Championships in Tauranga in April.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other organisations to receive NZCT funding were Whanganui Collegiate School ($6000 for accommodation) and Wanganui Pirates Rugby Football Club ($3000 for medical supplies and mouthguards).</p>
