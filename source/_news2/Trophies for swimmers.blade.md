<p>It was another busy year for the Toyota Wanganui Swimming Club members to take stock of when they met for the 2015-16 prizegiving at the Wanganui Squash Club on Sunday.</p>
<p>As well as recognising the club's handful of top stars who are medal contenders at national championships, the awards also recognised some strong attendance numbers for what is now Wanganui's sole swimming club - with the big events being the Spring Meet last August, the Signature Meet in February and the club championships in May and June.</p>
<p>In highlights on the national scene, standouts <strong>Elena Forlong</strong>, Shannon Schimanski and <strong>Sarya Lower</strong> qualified for the NZ Short Course championships in August 2015.</p>
<p>In age group competition, Schimanski won in the 100m and 200m breaststroke gold while <strong>Forlong</strong> gained the 200m fly bronze, before coming sixth in the open finals where Schimanski also placed in the Top 10 for her events.</p>
<p>Twenty club swimmers went to the Wellington Long Course championships in January, winning medals and gaining personal best times.</p>
<p>Georgia Abraham, Cayden Earles and Nikki Furlong flew the club flag at the NZ Junior championships in February, with Abraham winning 50m butterfly bronze.</p>
<p>Four swimmers qualified for the NZ Division II competition in Invercargill in March, with <strong>Alex Forlong</strong> and <strong>Grace Hogan</strong> able to go.</p>
<p><strong>Forlong</strong> won the 200m butterfly bronze, while <strong>Hogan</strong> came fourth in the 200m backstroke and was selected in the Wellington Regional Swim Team.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Elena Forlong, Lower</strong> and Schimanski qualified for April's NZ Open Championships and along with <strong>Niamh Hogan</strong> they also went to the NZ Age Group Champs that same month.</span></p>
<p><strong>Lower</strong> won silver in 100m and 200m freestyle, Schimanski took silver in the 50m breaststroke and was fourth in 100m breaststroke, while <strong>Forlong</strong> came fourth in 200m fly and fifth in the 100m version.</p>
<p>Swimming teams run on the strength of their volunteers and the club recognised Brenda O'Shaughnessy and Neil Forlong for their hard work and service, while the occasion was also marked by the granting of life membership to Steve Ross.</p>
