<p><br />Artists Open Studios 2019 may be over but the feeling lingers at Space Gallery this Saturday.</p>
<p>Fleur Wickes&rsquo; Tenderness and Glen Hutchins&rsquo; Risk Fate may seem poles apart but both exhibitions explore human responses to the unpredictability of life.</p>
<p>Space Gallery owner and curator Sarah Williams says Wickes has made great use of photography overlaid with pencil drawing to express vulnerability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fleur has achieved some amazing 3D effects and the works express how we open ourselves up to pain but the rewards can be tenderness and kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchins has used spray paint and polyurethane on canvas to express the way orderliness and structure are affected by risk, chance and chaos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are two very different exhibitions that somehow work really well together,&rdquo; Williams says.</p>
<p>She is also showing a retrospective of her own work, The Path of Things, in the third pop-up gallery at Space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It represents almost a decade of my work and includes pieces that I have sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams says Space has previously held exhibitions that started the week before Open Studios but she has decided to extend to the week after this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed to work well because we&rsquo;ve had a lot of people coming through during the past week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today is the last chance to catch the three exhibitions at 66 Taupo Quay on the corner of St Hill St. Gallery hours are from 10am until 2pm.</p>
