<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Fifteen-year-old Heath McKenzie, a year 10 student at Whanganui High School, is a busy lad, playing football, cricket and athletics when he's not rehearsing for his lead role in&nbsp;<em>Dick Whittington and His Cat</em>.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He's been in a few shows &mdash;&nbsp;<em>The Wind in the Willows</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. &mdash; where he's been singing and dancing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I did dance a bit in the other shows but this is the first time I've had to sing on my own.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Everyone is so lovely and supportive that I've overcome my fears and Kieran's a great singing coach so that helps. It also helps that the director is my uncle so I feel comfortable about asking him things if I have any questions." Does he have any pets?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yes, just one, a cat," he told me.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Silly question really wasn't it?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Dick Whittington and His Cat</em>&nbsp;plays at Repertory Theatre from December 13-23 with evening performances on December 13,14, 20 and 21 at 6.30pm and matinees on December 15, 16, 22 and 23 at 2pm.</strong></p>
