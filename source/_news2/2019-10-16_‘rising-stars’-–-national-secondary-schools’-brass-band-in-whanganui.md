The National Secondary Schools’ Brass Band will be playing a public concert in Whanganui at 3pm on Friday, October 4 at Christ Church, 243 Wicksteed Street. The concert will feature a range of popular pieces plus one “more demanding test piece” says Musical Director, Leigh Martin. It will also have guest soloist, Mike Ford play his horn. Leigh describes Mike as “world class, a winner of the New Zealand Masters and Open competition for his tenor horn. Plus he is an all-round nice guy.”

Each year applications for the Secondary Schools Brass Band are invited. After listening to about 70 recorded auditions, Leigh, who has been the director for two years, selected 43. In the first week of the October school holidays, those selected will meet in New Plymouth for individual and group tuition. Leigh says, “We have some top brass musicians coming in including four from the NZ Army Band.

It is important to give all the students an opportunity to perform especially ‘on tour.’ So they will be travelling to Whanganui on the Friday to perform at 3pm. It should be a great concert given the good acoustics in the church – a wonderful setting for any concert. The group will then return to New Plymouth to give a public concert there on the Saturday before the prize giving in an evening ceremony.

Entry to the concert is only $10 for adults and $5 for students, seniors and the unwaged. There is no charge for children under 12. The concert will last about two hours.
