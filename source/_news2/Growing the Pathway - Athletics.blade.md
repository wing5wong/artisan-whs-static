<p>A huge team of 94 athletes has recently been selected to represent Whanganui High school at the 2017 Whanganui secondary school athletics champs being held this Wednesday at Cooks Gardens starting at 12.45 with finals scheduled to go at 5.15.</p>
<p>All these athletes qualified to compete through their strong performances at the High school athletics champs held last week at Cooks, the numbers qualifying being a strong indication of the success of the development<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;pathway currently being put in place at the school.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>It&rsquo;s a great finish to the first full year of this athlete pathway which is designed to give all students at the school the opportunity to develop their fundamental athletic and movement skills. It&rsquo;s designed to allow them to both participate in athletics but also support their development in a wide range of other sports across the school and community. The programme started in November 2015 with just 3 athletes and its success sees it in the process of expanding to support other key sports within the school.</p>
<p>The majority of these athletes will finish their summer season with the interschool&rsquo;s while a selected group will head on to compete at the North Island Secondary school&rsquo;s athletics champs being held in Inglewood on the 8th / 9th April.</p>
<p>For the remainder the opportunity to train and compete will set them up for a great winter season and future sporting success.</p>
