<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui rock band Kessel<span>&nbsp;(ex WHS students) h</span>ope to turn two and half years of graft into a successful 2019.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The four-piece kick of the new year with two hometown gigs and frontman Jason Lane hopes to end it with a record and good line-up of summer shows.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lane, Tim Archer, Simon Grant and Alex Marsh came together over Easter in 2016 to form Kessel after stints in various Whanganui covers bands.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Tim and I were a bit over doing the covers thing and decided to form a band," Lane says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since then Kessel have played various Whanganui shows and hit the road to Hamilton, Auckland and New Plymouth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It really came out of nowhere. It was all original, all new and we've been going great guns ever since trying to play more in town and get a bit of a support base," Lane says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"After getting a bit more comfortable the songs are getting more complex in places and there's more ideas being thrown into the ring to make sure there's more diversity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The cool thing is now we've got enough songs that we can select what kind of gig we're playing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kessel play at the Caboodle as part of Vintage Weekend from 3pm to 4pm on January 19 and are also planning a fundraising gig for Chronicle Records at Lucky Bar + Kitchen on February 1.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were in the process of recording four new tracks at Chronicle Records when it was broken into late last year with equipment stolen and damaged, including a hard drive with the band's recordings.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're confident that our stuff's still on it but we need to pay to get it fixed," Lane said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He hoped to invite other bands which had recorded at Chronicle Records to join the gig with money raised going to cover the costs of what they've lost or to get gear repaired.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I guess what people don't realise is the knock-on effect of something like that," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People might break in somewhere, take a couple of microphones, a guitar, mess stuff up, but it's not just that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"How many people were booked in there to record? How many Whanganui musicians have been affected? How many other people's work was on that computer?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Years and years of hard work goes into the point where you can get into the studio to be ready to have something recorded professionally and for now that is gone."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kessel plan to finish the recording of four songs they have almost completed to go with two others already available to stream online - and then work towards having enough for an album.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lane says it's been "refreshing" to be writing and recording original music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Because you don't know what's going to happen.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Every single song has been all four of us contributing to make the song completely different to what it was at the start.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You can hear how and song started and how it finished up and we want to keep doing that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a pretty cool thing to be doing and that just comes with same guys in the same room doing the same thing all the time and listening to everyone's ideas.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We try every idea."</p>
