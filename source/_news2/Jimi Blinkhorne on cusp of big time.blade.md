<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Teenage Whanganui roller hockey talent Jimi Blinkhorne is on the cusp of something big.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The 16-year-old has just returned from back-to-back gold in Melbourne at the Australia Day Cup national club championships after reuniting with the Mordialloc under-17 side.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The same side, with Blinkhorne again at the wheel, won last year's title after an unbeaten run and repeated the dose again in Dandenong in Melbourne last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During the same tournament Blinkhorne also rolled out for the Melbourne-based Mordialloc club's number three senior team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Playing in blistering hot conditions, Blinkhorne didn't miss a beat scoring in every under-<br />17 division match to win gold.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, the icing on the cake when he was named MVP (Most Valuable Player) in the senior division.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was great to win back-to-back under-17 national titles, but it was a real buzz to get named MVP of all the senior sides from around Australia - I didn't expect that, especially after finishing about eighth in that division," Blinkhorne said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Paul "Blink" Blinkhorne accompanied his son to Melbourne this year where both enjoyed the hospitality of Australian roller hockey mate Ash Clee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Blinkhornes had met the Clee family on previous trips to Melbourne and in fact, Ash and Jimi had travelled to Spain together last year for a month-long training camp.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This trip would've been a whole harder without the friendship and hospitality of the Australians, especially the Clee family who put us up," Blinkhorne senior said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was some magnificent roller hockey played at the Australia Day Cup tournament by all teams, but especially Mordialloc. When they announced the under-17 MVP I was a little bit disappointed it wasn't Jimi or Ash to be fair, but then they announced the senior men MVP and it was Jimi I couldn't contain myself - that was huge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The heat was really oppressive. The temperature was around 42 degrees outside, but inside it must have got up around the 50s despite the fans. I just kept pouring water into Jimi."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The youngster returns for his final year at <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> in a few weeks, although his mind will be firmly on how to make the New Zealand team to play in the annual trans-Tasman series 160km north of Brisbane in Gympie on May 10-12.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hopefully I can make the New Zealand junior team, but I'd really like to play for the senior side. That would be awesome to make the senior team," young Blinkhorne said.</p>
