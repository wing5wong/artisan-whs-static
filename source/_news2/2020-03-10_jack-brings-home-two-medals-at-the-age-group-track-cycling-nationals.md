Well done to Jack Overweel who competed at the Age Group Track Cycling Nationals in the weekend.  

He was in a field of 36 riders in the U17 boys.  

Jack won a silver medal in the match sprinting and obtained a gold medal in the 500TT with a result of less than a second off a NZ record.  

Fantastic riding by a first year U17 rider. Congrats Jack 💚🚴‍♂️💛
