<p><strong></strong><strong>Jubilee Stadium packed as Whanganui High School revives tradition.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>All of Whanganui High School was under one roof on Friday afternoon, for a special assembly to start its new house system.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The school has about 1500 students and more than 100 teachers. Together they filled Whanganui's Jubilee Stadium to capacity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The students made up more than 60 per cent of Whanganui's teenagers, principal Martin McAllen said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's certainly the first time we have all been together since the 1970s. The school is too big to fit into the school hall. We can all assemble on the field, but then there's no sound system."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The stadium was a sea of grey, white and green as the students arrived in their form classes in an endless stream and sat together in their four houses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School had a house system in the 1970s, but no one could remember when it lapsed. Mr McAllen expected reviving it would be make for an exciting change.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think a school this size really needs a house system for house spirit, school spirit, collaboration, competition and a sense of identity," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The students were put into houses before the school year began, with efforts made to keep parents, children, siblings and cousins in the same house as each other. The teachers and support staff are in houses too.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are only three people in the school who are not in houses - myself, the assistant principal and the MƒÅori dean," Mr McAllen said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The community was consulted about house names and identities. The four chosen are Awa, Maunga, Moana and Whenua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Those names were gifted to the school, along with the iwi story of the origin of the Whanganui River. It was welcomed into the school by its Kia Whaiora kapa haka group, with the story carried on a covered board by a group including Pipiana and Tamahau Rowe.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were to explain the significance of the house names, and students were to read the story aloud.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ceremony gives the school a strong and genuine connection to its community, Mr McAllen said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since the year began students have begun their school day in form classes with others of mixed age who are in the same house, adding "a real whanau atmosphere".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Year 9s have really appreciated the vertical form classes. Often students don't know students outside their year level unless they're involved in the performing arts," Mr McAllen said.</p>
