<p>Tim Easton &ndash; Returns to Whanganui via Army postings at Afghanistan and Egypt</p>
<p>Tim Easton went to Durie Hill School, Intermediate and High School before going to Victoria University to study law and politics. However, he joined the Territorial&rsquo;s while at university and before he had completed his degree in Public Policy and Commercial Law, he was offered a job as a civilian policy advisor for the Army General Staff.</p>
<p>This led to a seven months deployment in Afghanistan in 2011 a<span class="text_exposed_show">s an &lsquo;infantry platoon commander,&rsquo; although his main role was as a finance controller. He explains &ldquo;we used cash for everything &ndash; wages, food, and rent &ndash; so every week we would get new supplies.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">His experience in Bamiyan Province where the New Zealand military were stationed was &ldquo;an eye opener into real poverty and the absence of relief and support structures to help.&rdquo; Part of his responsibility was to work with NZ Aid, which with US Aid, was introducing the growing of potatoes into the area.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Returning to Wellington he was able to combine his interest in politics with a position as Executive Advisor for the then Labour Party spokesperson for State Owned Enterprises and Small Businesses, Clayton Cosgrove. However, he admits &ldquo;the 2014 election was not the best experience,&rdquo; and so he moved onto the Ministry of Health as a Principal Advisor, while also completing his degree.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Two years later the NZ Military came back to him with an offer to be part of the New Zealand Peace Keeping Mission on the border of Israel and Gaza. He says, &ldquo;it was fascinating talking about the relationship between the Israelis and Palestinians. There is no second opinion there.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">On his return to New Zealand he got the position of second in command of the West Coast 5/7 Battalion based in Whanganui. &ldquo;Coming back to Whanganui was a real draw card&rdquo; he says. As it is a part time position he also has a &rsquo;Community Outreach Advisor for Manawatu and Whanganui&rsquo; with Parliamentary Services, based in the Hon Iain Lees Galloway&rsquo;s office in Palmerston North. Tim&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;e, Rebecca Hay, is a family lawyer with Armstrong Barton.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Tim has also accepted the role of Chair of the local Labour Party saying, &ldquo;I hate sitting on the side lines. I want to put my energy into positive change.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;We believe Whanganui to be a winnable seat and we plan to push to win it back.&rdquo; He is encouraged by the enthusiasm of local party members saying &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t relax in the off years between elections.&rdquo;</span></p>
