<p class="element element-paragraph">Looking out from the club house over a patchy green and brown course, three golf carts zoom off in different directions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Inside them are keen golfers participating in NZME's second Whanganui Charity Golf Tournament sponsored by Mitre 10 Mega Wanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One of the white carts stops on the Belmont Links course offered for the 18-hole Ambrose tournament by the Wanganui Golf Club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A man gets out wearing a polo shirt, shorts, a black cap and white gloves. He grabs his club, positions himself, lines up the shot and swings into the stiff breeze.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ball rolls to a stop about half a metre from the hole and the man moves forward to tap it in.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Among the play in a cart of their own are John Broad of Broad Roofing and Graham McLay from Rainaway Spouting on the Spot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The mates met in 2006 and have attended a host of golf tournaments in Whanganui, but Broad likes the fact that this one is for charity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People used to ring me asking for donations for kids with disability problems. I did, but one time I discovered it was an absolute sham. That destroyed phone donations for me.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This here is credible because you can see the people who are involved in person. The likes of Harcourts and Mitre 10 wouldn't put their name to it unless it was legit."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Naming sponsor Mitre 10 Mega Wanganui chose Wanganui Riding for the Disabled (NZRDA) as the recipient of the funds raised at the charity event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui NZRDA have raised $140,000 of $445,000 they need by June next year to purchase their Purnell St land that the owners sold while they were leasing it in 2016.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The funds will be raised through a full compliment of 20 teams of five and an auction following competition featuring a host of prizes donated by Whanganui businesses.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People don't mind spending money at charity events, if there's a raffle or something, everybody will buy a ticket," Broad says.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">He looks over barren land towards some houses in the distance as he awaits his next shot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Just checking if my guys are working. There are meant to be three guys on that roof there, but I can't see them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Joining Broad and McLay are <strong>Tyler Lock</strong> and Pro Powder Coating's <strong>Brooke Lock</strong> and Kalvin Field.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pro Powder Coating and Rainaway Spouting on the Spot operate out of the same location on Cooks St and despite what McLay called a "balls up" in which they both entered separate teams, they worked things out and combined in the end.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"As for Tyler, he used to be a professional golfer, he has a six handicap," Broad says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For me, it's not playing pal, it's an act of aggression."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Broad laughs, then says he began playing golf when he was about 15 while working on fishing boats.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"A mate and I used to have a set of golf clubs down the back hatch of the boat so whenever we'd come into any port, we could go and play golf.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then we'd go to the pub. Every town had a pub and a golf course, it was perfect. Then you get a partner and that becomes a bit buggered," he says and laughs again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Further down the course on the 12th hole - "French Pass" - Brooke Lock lines up her shot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You got this Brookey," her cousin Field says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She lifts her club into position, gets her stance right, swings forward and connects with a nice thud.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The ball skirts away to the right, up a rise and into the rough.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Oh, I've lost it," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's up the hill, you'll find it," Field replies.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"No, I've lost the touch," she says and more laughter ensues.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The two friends Broad and McLay approach in their cart and beverages in hand, they exit to take their shots.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jesus, this ain't good guys," Field says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"John, you need to land it," McLay follows up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is where I thrive," Broad says, lining up his shot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A crack rings out through the air as the club strikes the ball sweetly, sending it flying through the air.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's better," McLay says. "You might be in the beach though."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All competitors enjoyed drinks and a meal in the clubhouse after play, followed by the auction and prize presentations to the winning teams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The aim was to raise more money than last year's tournament which was just over $13,000 and that information will be included in the&nbsp;<em>Whanganui Chronicle</em>when it is available.</p>
