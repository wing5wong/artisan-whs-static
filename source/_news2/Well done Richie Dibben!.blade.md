<p><strong>Well done Richie Dibben winning both the Super Motard races on Boxing Day, his first racing of the series!</strong></p>
<p>The crowds at Whanganui on Boxing Day were also thrilled to get right behind local hero Richie Dibben, the Kiwi international making his comeback from recent injury.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He delighted with his Super Motard bike prowess on the tight and twisty circuit, taking his Suzuki RM-Z450 to win both Super Motard outings.</p>
