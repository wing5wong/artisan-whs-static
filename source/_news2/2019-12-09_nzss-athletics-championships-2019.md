**WHS Results** 💚💛💚💛

The WHS athletics team of 22 athletes plus coaches returned home Sunday from a very difficult N.Z secondary school Athletics champs with 7 medals, 3 gold, 2 Silver and 2 Bronze. The weather was atrocious for the 3 days, but the team rose to the occasion and performed superbly. This was another step up from last year’s 6 medal haul and moved us to **No.2 in the N.Z secondary school rankings**, a massive lift from not being ranked in the top 100 4 years ago when our pathway programme started.

A real highlight of the meet was the performances of our hurdling group who really put the school on the N.Z athletics map for this discipline. We came home with three Gold and two bronze medals in this area alone and were by far the most successful school.

We also won two silver medals in relays along with 5 other top 8 finishes and set 5 new school records.

Maggie Jones returned home with 2 Gold and 2 Silver medals to make her one of the most successful athletes at the meet along with Paris Munro’s 4 medals and Charlotte Baker and Casie Glentworth with 2 each. Nat Kirk also put in an outstanding performance in his 300mtr hurdles taking the Gold in only his 3rd ever race over this event. In fact, the No. of great performances on the last day had the meet commentator asking, “Where has this WHS team come from?”
