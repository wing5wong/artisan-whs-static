<h4><span>Brad Mancer's proud moment - ANZAC Dawn service is held at Anzac Cove in commemoration on Gallipoli Peninsula.&nbsp;</span></h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Former Whanganui High School student Brad Mancer never imagined having the opportunity to play the&nbsp;<em>Last Post</em>&nbsp;at Gallipoli.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>So being asked to play it at the official Anzac Day commemorations on the peninsula this year was an honour, he said.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mancer is part of the Royal New Zealand Air Force Band based in Wellington. He was selected as a member of a tri-service brass quintet to play at the dawn service and the New Zealand service at Chunuk Bair on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Through that role he was asked to play the&nbsp;<em>Last Post</em>&nbsp;at the dawn service.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is something I never thought I would have the opportunity to do but I am so thankful I was asked to play and honour our fallen through the&nbsp;<em>Last Post</em>," he told the&nbsp;<em>Chronicle&nbsp;</em>from Turkey.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mancer said it was an emotional service at Gallipoli.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Through the night it got extremely cold and thousands turned out to sleep under the stars while people from the NZ Defence Force and the Australian Defence Force entertained the crowd with a reflective service throughout the night," Mancer said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If anyone was unclear of what took place at Gallipoli, this really set the scene and gave everyone a clear understanding of what went on 103 years ago."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mancer was selected for the RNZAF Band, which he has been in for five years, as a bugler.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has played in the Wanganui Senior Brass Band and was selected along with his brother <strong>Jacob</strong> for the New Zealand Secondary Schools Brass Band in 2012 while at high school.</p>
