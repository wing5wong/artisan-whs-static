<p><strong>23/09 Xiamen</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we flied from Guangzhou to Xiamen at 1:30 pm. Everyone is excited but tired. The we went on bus arrived in this big, huge, giant campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accommodation is cool, everyone has a big, individual room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Food is Yummy, Ginny started licking fingers because of not enough trained chopstick skills&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facility such as sports field, is awesome, after Karan scored the&nbsp;last goal, I have to confess that Mr Ding is not young anymore üòä&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, students are quite excited about their first Chinese style breakfast, GOOD LUCK ! Then a full and busy day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possible time to night check every one 's room now with Ms Su'a...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beck&nbsp;<br />(WHS Chinese teacher)</p>
