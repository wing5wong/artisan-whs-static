<p><span>AT WORK: Cleaning graves for posterity are (from left) Mitchell Brett-Atkins, Anastasia O'Leary and Leon Harnett with local cadets.</span></p>
<p><span>Aramoho Cemetery's true war graves from World War 1 received a spruce up on Sunday when cadets from 9 Squadron ATC, TS Calliope Sea Cadets, Wanganui Cadet Corps and prefects from Wanganui High School took to the headstones with water and elbow grease.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">True war graves hold the remains of men who died in New Zealand from injuries sustained in the war.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">"Obviously, most of New Zealand's true war graves are overseas," says Squadron Leader Charles Quirk, who organised the working bee."<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The team were at work last year giving the graves a clean up and they intend doing it again next year.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">"We'll do it before Anzac Day every year and lock it into the training programmes.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">"That way they'll continue to look good," says Charles.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">He came armed with a map of the graves and deployed the cadets around the cemetery to work.<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Some of the inscriptions are worn or faded so it is hoped Veterans' Affairs will redo the lettering and graphics before they're lost.</span></p>
