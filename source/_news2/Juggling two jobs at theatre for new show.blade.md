<p data-bind="text: $data">Brie Parkinson is busy juggling two important roles at the moment &mdash; mother to her adorable two-month-old baby boy Jaxson, and production manager for Repertory Theatre&rsquo;s latest production, Ugly Customers. How does she manage both roles?</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;[Jaxson&rsquo;s] the assistant production manager,&rdquo; Brie says. &ldquo;I was working at the theatre right up until he was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Brie has been involved in theatre for most of her life. She learnt dance from her pre-school years and her first on-stage appearance was in a junior production at school when she was only five.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Last year Brie enjoyed taking drama lessons with the year six children at her old primary school, St John&rsquo;s Hill, and is considering volunteering to contribute to their drama programme again this year. How extensive is her own theatre experience?</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been acting, singing and dancing on stage. Behind the scenes I&rsquo;ve been stage managing, doing props, lighting, sound, front of house . . . well, everything really,&rdquo; Brie says.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">What exactly is involved in production management?</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;It can be quite stressful,&rdquo; Brie says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make sure the director&rsquo;s happy, that everything is running smoothly. I&rsquo;ve got to make sure the stage manager knows what to do, that front of house is up to speed, that they know all the safety procedures, that lighting and sound are all good to go. Oh yes</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">. . . advertising has to be on track too. I&rsquo;ve got to oversee all of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I really like it [the play] because the characters are all relatable. If you walked into a bank (Ugly Customers is set in a bank) you&rsquo;d recognise the characters. The play&rsquo;s really funny too. The humour will appeal to all different age groups.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ugly Customers is a hilarious take on banking experiences, good and bad. Go along and see if your experience matches that of Laura and Harold. Either way you will be really entertained.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">[Brie was a hoot as snooty gold-digger Paris Stilton in Roger Hall&rsquo;s pantomime, Jack and the Beanstalk, in 2017. She returned last year as Heather in Ted Charlton&rsquo;s Ringing in the Changes .&mdash;Ed]</p>
