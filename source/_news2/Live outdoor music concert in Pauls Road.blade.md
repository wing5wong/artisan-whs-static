<p>The annual concert at 42 Pauls Road in Whanganui East has become a feature of Whanganui&rsquo;s musical calendar. It is at 42 Pauls Road where there is plenty of space not only for folding chairs and blankets as well as a chilly bin of food and drinks but also for parking. Gates open at 11am with the music starting at noon.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Starting the concert this year will be &lsquo;In Business&rsquo; (photo) &ndash; a year 10 group of students from Whanganui High School, who have alrea</strong><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>dy shared the stage with Fred Loveridge and his group &lsquo;Whiskey Mama&rsquo; at Caroline&rsquo;s. Fred, who tutors the students at High School, says &ldquo;they play their own compositions as well as cover songs.&rdquo;</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">A highlight of the concert will be the Auckland band &lsquo;Burn the Bridges,&rsquo; who recently played at Rhythm and Vines. Fred describes them as &ldquo;an up and coming band to watch, playing really good songs.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;They play an original mixed bag ranging from Blues and Rock through Funk to Folk Country to keep you guessing.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Palmerston North band, Bullfrog, are returning this year and will feature Janine Knap. Also returning is &lsquo;Re&mdash;Set.&rsquo; Local osteopath, Richard Littlejohn is &ldquo;one of my favourites,&rdquo; says Fred. He plays acoustic and will soon be releasing an EP. Fred&rsquo;s band &lsquo;Whiskey Mama&rsquo; have been very busy over summer performing from New Plymouth through to Palmerston North.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Finishing the show will be The Replicants and Fred says &ldquo;everyone will be up and dancing by then. They&rsquo;re a great party band playing popular cover songs.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Pauls Road Live raises funds for the Starlet Hope Charity Trust. Last year it raised enough to support three families whose children had to spend time in Auckland with travel and household expenses.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Tickets to the show cost $20 and are available from Gatshack Music in Ridgway Street. Those under 12 get in free. BYO picnic and drinks with some BBQ food available.</span></p>
