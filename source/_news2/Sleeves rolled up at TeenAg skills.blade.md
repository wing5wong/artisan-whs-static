<p><em><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/wanganui-chronicle/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503426&amp;objectid=12132093">Watch the VIDEO by Stuart Munro</a></em></p>
<p>On one side of Whanganui Racecourse, students are frantically stepping standards into the ground and erecting a temporary fence - complete with a battery unit to make it hot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Surrounding them, others are connecting a mobile trough, working with chainsaws or even partaking in a good old-fashioned gumboot toss.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>It is the first ever TeenAg skills day in Whanganui and Whanganui High School students were keen to make the most of the opportunity, with over 20 signing up to take part.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Territory manager for Taranaki and Whanganui Megan Bates says NZ Young Farmers have been focusing on Whanganui for the last 12 months.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These events are not just for practical people, they're for those that are high achieving as well and that's the big message that we're struggling to get across in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're working more closely with the technology aspect heading forward and that will hopefully attract those students that might not be so practical."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bates has been visiting school's all over the city and when she went to Whanganui High School she found a keen teacher in Nick Staples who helped to organise the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">TeenAg is being scrapped and replaced with the FMG Junior Young Farmer of the Year and the Taranaki/Manawatū regional final will be held in Whanganui next April.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That's a huge day, there will be 40 or 50 teams and those spaces sell out really quickly," Bates said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to promote it in Whanganui so that they can get some teams in there first."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Schools need to become a TeenAg club to participate and can easily do so by visiting the TeenAg website.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Participants will travel to Whanganui from schools between Wellington and New Plymouth for the event.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bates said that there would be 50,000 jobs coming up in the agriculture industry in the next five years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The primary industries are really important and it would be good for schools to encourage students to participate in these initiatives.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We need students coming into our industry in all aspects, whether it's practical or working with machinery, technology and those kinds of things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bates has been in her role for four years and in that time, the number of TeenAg clubs has risen from a dire two, to a whopping 18.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She encouraged as many people to get involved with the junior farmer competition as possible.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There has been some good learning here today, we have the team that came second in our Manawatū competition here and they're like little sponges which is fantastic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to see more of those students that are interested and passionate. Come along with a friend, have a go, you'll surprise yourself and have a lot of fun."</p>
