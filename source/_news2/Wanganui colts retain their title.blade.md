<p><span>Champions again: The Wanganui Under 20's following winning the Hurricanes Regional title in Palmerston North on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>The NZCT Wanganui Under 20 team continues to dominant regional youth rugby as they again retained the Hurricanes Regional Under 20 title with a 27-21 win over Wairarapa-Bush on Saturday.</p>
<p>Both teams had accounted for Poverty Bay and Horowhenua-Kapiti in their other matches to set up the decider on the IRANZ Academy grounds at Massey University in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>The <strong>tryscorers</strong> were forward <strong>Corbin Warren</strong>, midfielder <strong>Ethan Robinson</strong>, winger <strong>Jesse Kemp</strong> and halfback Kahl Elers-Green, while first-five <strong>Hererangi Meihana</strong> added two conversions and a penalty. (Highlighted players all WHS students last year).</p>
<p>Coach Denis Edwards said the Ruapehu halfback Elers-Green was easily the player of the day - directing the traffic and setting up a couple of tries including his own.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, when the MVP points for all the teams were added up, Meihana was named the joint Player of the Tournament.</strong></p>
<p>"That's four years we've been undefeated, and quite convincingly, I think," said Edwards.</p>
<p>"The boys throughout the years have been showing how great they are at this level."</p>
<p>It was a shame that while the Under 20's won their four games this season, including one pre-tournament match, all of them were held away from home.</p>
<p>While the Hurricanes tournament must be played at IRANZ as it is centrally located for all unions to attend, Edwards would like to see a match arranged regularly following tournaments so the Under 20's could have a chance to show what they can do in a Cooks Gardens curtain raiser game.</p>
<p>"That's the type of thing they need to have, and to be seen against their own age group."</p>
<p>Eight of his team currently play Premier club rugby, but it is when playing against others at Under 20 level that they truly shine, Edwards said.</p>
