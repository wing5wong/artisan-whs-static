<p>That they are finalists is almost a formality these days. But who will be this year's Premier 1 netball champions is anything but.</p>
<p>Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School and Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau will once again play off for the title at Springvale Stadium tonight.</p>
<p>The two sides have met in every final since 2011 and Kaierau will be keen to add to their sole title in that time, which came in 2012.</p>
<p>Kaierau will encouraged by their efforts in the last round-robin match a fortnight ago where they matched High School until the final seconds, going down 51-50.</p>
<p>For Wanganui High School to pull off a three-peat, coach Lisa Murphy said focus throughout the entire match was key.</p>
<p>Murphy said her team knew how to win and if the players did things right, she was confident.</p>
<p>"If they can play that consistent netball I think they can win," she said.</p>
<p>But High School would have to go up another gear from their last outing against Kaierau.</p>
<p>"There's always improvement.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">You can't just go out and rely on how you played last time. A few of my girls haven't played finals before. It's new to them. But our juniors are stepping up beautifully, they're not scared."</span></p>
<p>Four of the High School squad have been to a final before and will be the ones looked upon to lead.</p>
<p>"I suppose it's just about being focused," Murphy said.</p>
<p>The grand final starts at 7.45pm at Springvale Stadium. EC Sports play Mint Cafe Marist for third place, starting at 6pm.</p>
