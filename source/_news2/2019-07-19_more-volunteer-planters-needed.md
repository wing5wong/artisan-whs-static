Castlecliff Coast Care is in action this Saturday at Castlecliff Beach.

Volunteers will be planting mainly ngaio, flax, cabbage trees and taupata on a section of the rear dunes opposite Manuka St. Since Ted Frost started the project 10 years ago, volunteers have contributed almost 10,000 hours and early plantings are now well established. A major contribution has been by a group from IDEA Services who come out regularly and are close now to contributing 1000 hours.

So far this winter the IDEA Services group, students from Castlecliff School and **Whanganui High School** have contributed, and Aranui School has booked a planting day next term.

Volunteers are required this Saturday — bring a space, sturdy shoes and gloves, and meet at Duncan Pavilion before 1pm.
