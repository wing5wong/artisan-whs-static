Rebekah Phillips recently represented New Zealand in the NZ U16 Junior Polocrosse team who played the Australian Junior team in Narrabri, NSW last weekend. 

Australia won all 3 games, with the New Zealand girls competing well against the Aussie side. The games were live streamed online. 

Rebekah is staying with a NSW polocrosse family for 4 weeks as part of her scholarship and playing in a club side at weekend carnivals.

Well done Rebekah and enjoy the rest of your stay in Australia.
