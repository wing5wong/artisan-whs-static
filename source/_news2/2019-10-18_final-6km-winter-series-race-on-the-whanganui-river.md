The final of the 6km Blinkhorne and Carroll Winter series on the Whanganui River was raced on Sunday 13 October.

Congratulations to our students who were part of a composite crew of younger male and female rowers who were **3rd** home, and simply out for the fun of it and not eligible for the Tonks Trophy. 

The crew featured **WHS students Niamh Monk, Jaimee Bridger, Ella Dudley, two ex students Cameron Lawrence and Levi Carroll;** plus Luke Watts, Thomas Monaghan, Jack Pringle and cox Jenny Monk, with all of them being in the senior category except for Bridger, who was club.

They had line honours for the day with the quickest finish of 20m 7.72s, which was enough for a prognostic score of 91.91 per cent.
