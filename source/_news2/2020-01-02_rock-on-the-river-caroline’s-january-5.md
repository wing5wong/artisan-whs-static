‘Rock on the River’ returns to Caroline’s Boat Shed, 181 Somme Parade, on Sunday, January 5. This year’s event was a great success and next year’s concert from 2pm till around 6pm, looks just as promising.

The stage is on the back of a large truck/trailer, set up parallel to the river, allowing patrons in the Boat Shed and the car park area, a full viewing and listening spot. Entrance is free.

**Three bands will be performing. ‘Rhythm Vision,’ a Prog Rock band from Whanganui High School, will start.** Well known musician and music teacher, Fred Loveridge, says “They were hugely appealing last year. They have an ability to draw people into their music, with it totally original.

**‘In Business’, also from High School, will be next.** Fred says, “They are doing great things around town including opening for other bands. Considering that they are only year 10 students, this is amazing. “They also write their own music which is also Prog Rock.” Fred adds, “In Business has some interesting guitar tunes. Quite hard and heavy but very musical.”

**The third band is 'Whiskey Mama'** of which Fred is a key member. He says, “We play more classic rock – the hits and songs which weren’t hits and perhaps didn’t receive enough radio time. People comment on our song choices saying, I kind of remember the songs and asking who played them originally.”

Rhythm Vision will play for about 45 minutes followed by In Business for one hour and 20. Whiskey Mama will take it through to around 6pm.

Fred says, “The last event at Caroline’s was over labour weekend and it was packed. People enjoyed themselves, dancing to the music. It is a great venue for concerts.”

Caroline’s will be serving lunch and dinner as well as drinks.
