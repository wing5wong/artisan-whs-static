<p><br />The NCEA Level 3 Geography and Tourism students had a fantastic visit to the Gold Coast of Australia to have a behind the scenes look at the tourism industry.</p>
<p>After navigating a bus break down on the way to Wellington airport we thankfully made our flight on time!</p>
<p>We checked out Surfers Paradise and took a cruise to look at the multimillion dollar homes on the canals.</p>
<p>Our first theme park was Movieworld and we had a talk to find out the various roles required to make the park run, as well as the contribution tourism makes to the Queensland economy and beyond. A few roller coasters later we saw the Outback Spectacular show. We were again given a behind the scenes look at how the show was run, from the chefs and waitresses, to the horses and stables, to the actors and actresses.</p>
<p>The Currumbin Wildlife Park enabled our students to get up close and personal with koalas, kangaroos, snakes and stick insects amongst other Aussie creatures.</p>
<p>The Q1 building gave us great views of the linear pattern of development along the coast from the 77th floor.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Dreamworld and the chance to see another theme park in action.</p>
<p>An early start the next day to brave the swells on a whale watching cruise. We were lucky enough to see humpback whales in their natural environment.</p>
<p>Seaworld provided dolphins, penguins, stingrays, sharks, stunt shows and another roller coaster for good measure.</p>
<p>The following day we ventured into the hinterland, known as the &lsquo;green behind the gold&rsquo; for a look at a waterfall and the glow worm caves.</p>
<p>Time for a bit more shopping before heading home after a fun packed full on trip.</p>
