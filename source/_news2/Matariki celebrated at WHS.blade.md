<p><br />A hāngī pit was dug, food was cooked and a meal was shared at Whanganui High School to celebrate Matariki.</p>
<p>The school's four whānau classes that involved just over 100 students, planned and prepared for the day's celebrations.</p>
<p>Māori Dean Sean Brown said those students were responsible for koha and bring food and a lot of families have contributed the gift of food for Friday's meal.</p>
<p>Pork, venison, beef and eel that was gifted had been hunted and brought down from up the Whanganui river.</p>
<p>"We've celebrated Matariki, Māori new year, in the past but we wanted to make an effort this year to do it a traditional way," Brown said.</p>

<p><br />A small working party of 15, including staff and students, dug the hāngī on Thursday evening, stayed overnight and then prepared it for Friday's lunch.</p>
<p>Brown said he assumes this is the first time they have dug a hāngī on school grounds.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, students played traditional Māori games such as tītī tōrea before all school staff, international students and whānau students gathered for the lunch.</p>
<p>As Matariki is a cluster of stars, Whanganui celebrates its own regal star, Puanga that appears mid-June.</p>
