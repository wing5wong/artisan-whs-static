Crystal Dickinson had been Executive Assistant to John Bartley, owner of Bayleys Real Estate Whanganui and after gaining knowledge about the industry from the inside, with John’s support she has moved into selling Real Estate and brings a fresh, creative and committed approach.

Crystal’s immense capabilities are obvious when talking to her and asking her about her other interests prior to becoming a Real Estate Salesperson. She is also a Spin Instructor, Artist, mother and landlord.

When asking her how she manages so many different roles, she simply said “the key is I have a genuine passion for everything I do - be it teaching and motivating through my Spin Studio, Real Estate both on a professional and personal level, my art or being a mother. I love and enjoy every aspect, but more than that I love achieving goals and have found if I set my mind to something I’ll work as hard as possible until it is done.” Crystal wants to harness that hardworking ethic and focus on setting and achieving goals directly for her clients, in order to allow them to move onto that next chapter. 

One of Crystal’s passions is teaching and motivating spin classes, of which she has been doing on the side for the past 7 years. When she returned to Whanganui she learnt that no one was teaching in that space, so got the word out and started her own studio named Studio Spin. For the past two years she has been motivating, encouraging and guiding her members through her energetic, electric and highly addictive classes based at Club Fitness on Wicksteed Street.

Another interest is her art. She mixes a two part epoxy resin with coloured pigments to create striking works of art, (see picture), which hangs proudly at Bayleys reception in the distinctive Bayleys colours.

Crystal is a multi-talented woman that’s for sure and the newest face of real estate. She definitely does bring a fresh approach, likely to appeal to all ages as she is genuine, friendly and relatable be it through any of her many varied roles. You can contact Crystal on 027-8283180.
