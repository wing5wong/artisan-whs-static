<p><br />Singers in a Whanganui concert came back on stage after an interval in wigs and 70s clothing, waving their arms and making peace signs.</p>
<p>It was the Wanganui Community Choir's&nbsp;<em>Musicals and Movies Through the Decades</em>&nbsp;concert, on June 8 at the Central Baptist Church. They were about to launch into a selection of songs from the musical&nbsp;<em>Hair</em>, and the capacity audience loved it.</p>
<p>Musical director Lynn Whiteside likes musical theatre, and the concert focused on the genre. It began in the 1930s with songs from&nbsp;<em>42nd Street</em>, and included songs from&nbsp;<em>The Sound of Music</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Phantom of the Opera</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Mama Mia</em>.</p>
<p>It was an inclusive concert, Whiteside said, which is what the 50-strong choir aims for.</p>
<p>After the excitement of&nbsp;<em>Hair</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Mama Mia</em>, the choir calmed everybody down with a beautiful four-part harmony from the Bond film&nbsp;<em>Skyfall</em>.</p>
<p>Shelley Walls and members of Brass Whanganui were guest artists, and the accompanist was former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Abigail Livesay</strong>. The church was the fullest Whiteside had ever seen it.</p>
<p>"It was just chocker. I couldn't believe it."</p>
