<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>A difficult rescue at Kai Iwi Beach last month has seen Whanganui Surf Lifesavers win a national prize.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui has won the BP Rescue of the Month award for rescuing a father and daughter in February.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When chief lifeguard <strong>James Newell</strong>&nbsp;received a call from police to say two swimmers were missing off Kai Iwi Beach, he dispatched lifeguards <strong>Laura O'Keeffe and Alex Forlong in an Inflatable Rescue Boat (IRB) to assess the situation.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lifeguards Kaya Dobbie and Matthew Newell were stationed in the newly built watch tower, acting as the base of operations between lifeguards, police and coastguard.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Laura O'Keeffe attempted to get in close and dropped Alex Forlong into the water to collect the patients.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She got close enough to identify and check that they were okay but the storm surf was too powerful against the cliff.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They identified the patients as an adult male with his teenaged daughter who had an injured foot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The IRB then sat off the cliffs and kept watch while<strong> James Newell</strong> reassessed the situation from the watch tower.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The rescue helicopter was called but it was deemed too risky to try winch the patients out due to the storm surf and wind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A second IRB was deployed with lifeguards Phil Gilmore, <strong>Sophie Couper and Clarissa Nowak</strong> aboard.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The crews waited for a slight lull when <strong>Ms Nowak</strong> was able to swim to the stranded pair and rescue the girl who was taken to Whanganui Hospital.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lifeguards then used the same procedure to rescue the girl's father who was unharmed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">BP New Zealand managing director Debi Boffa said the coordinated response and great skills demonstrated by the lifeguards involved was outstanding.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Since 1968 we have been proud to stand behind this amazing organisation who help save the lives of thousands of people every year as well as educate people about how to stay safe on our beaches," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Surf Life Saving Club will receive a $500 BP gift voucher to help with the costs of keeping their community safe in the water.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lisa Smith of Surf Life Saving New Zealand said there will be an award presentation in Whanganui next week.</p>
