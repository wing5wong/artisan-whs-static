<p>On Thursday 11 May our team of five riders attended the Whanganui Interschool Gymkhana. &nbsp;The event had been post-poned from term 1 due to inclement weather; and Thursday the weather was no better! It was showery in the morning, and became torrential. &nbsp;The girls and horses were soaked but their enthusiasm never waned! &nbsp;The students who attended were Emma Forrester on Herb, Ella Kingston on Eve, Sophie Barron on Mac, Basia Sosnowska on Sir Soloman and Rebecca Benge on Blitz.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started off with only 2 horses ready for presentation - plaited. &nbsp;But quick action by students and mothers, we soon had a team of 4 for the 1st event which was turn out and counted towards final points. &nbsp;We came 3rd in this, with our newly acquired forest green saddle pads with gold crest embroidered on the back quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is composed of 4 events - flat classes, games, show hunter and show jumper. &nbsp;We won the Red Group competition with <strong>Sophie Barron</strong> gaining the most points for the day from all competitors, and <strong>Emma Forrester</strong> won the Blue division. &nbsp;Red jumped 65cm and Blue jumped 80cm courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the team points were added up, we came 3rd from about 10-12 teams. Basia noticed that Emma's name wasn't on the team list (only the top 4 riders from each school are in the team points), even though she had won her division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trophy had been awarded, and when I asked Basia's question to the organisers, they realised they had missed adding up some points. &nbsp;They called everyone back, took back the sashes and in the end <strong>Whanganui High School was the winner.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We finished about 4.45pm. A very long, wet, but successful day.&nbsp;</p>
