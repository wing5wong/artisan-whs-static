<p class="element element-paragraph">The 2017-18 speedway season will end with a bang tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former WHS students Kyle Heibner, Scott McIntosh, Max Holloway &amp; Callum Sturzaker all part of the star-studded field at Oceanviews final meeting of the season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's the final meeting of what has been a very successful season at Supercheap Auto Oceanview Family Speedway, and the organisers are determined to go out with a flourish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not only is there a full speedway programme, but the Wanganui Stockcar and Speedway Club's annual Demolition Derby will take place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Later in the evening, the skies above Oceanview will light up with a Fireworks display.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Superstocks are the feature class of the night, with three Memorial races in memory of the late Noel Kensington, George Podjursky and Craig Heibner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A quality field of superstocks will descend on Oceanview, led by current New Zealand superstock champion and victorious Palmerston North Panther teams racer William Humphries.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Humphries has had a dream season, as he was also in the championship-winning Palmerston North Panthers team at the ENZED Teams Champs in February.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Keeping Humphries honest will be the 3NZ car of Jordan Dare from Foxton, one of his Panthers teammates.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dare was impressive in winning the West Coast Superstocks at Oceanview in November.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With superstock racing at Gisborne cancelled this weekend, driver and race-car builder Peter Rees will have multiple cars at the track along with his son Ethan &ndash; the current 1NZ in the stockcar class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ethan Rees also campaigns in superstock, and is fast developing a reputation as a very canny and skilled driver.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In keeping with the family theme, the Dykstra Racing team from Foxton will take family participation to new heights tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sons Rangi, Ricky and Zane will be joined by their father, Sjoerd Dykstra.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sjoerd Dykstra has not competed in his own car since 2007, and this will be the first time he has raced alongside his sons.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rebecca Barr placed third in the West Coast superstocks, and is regarded as a very promising driver.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She will be joined by a number of visitors including Jake Baker (Palmerston North), Darryl Roper (Stratford) and Alex Bright (Nelson).</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bright, who teams races for the Tigers, is coming up with crew chief <strong>Kyle Heibner</strong>, who will present the Craig Heibner Memorial Trophy on behalf of the Heibner family tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerry Podjursky will head the local contingent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Last season, the veteran won two of the Memorial races, but there is one which continues to evade him &ndash; the race in memory of his late father, George Podjursky.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The younger Podjursky has finished second in that race in each of the last two seasons, and will be determined to go one place better tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other locals to the fore will be Wanganui Warrior <strong>Scott "Scooter" McIntosh</strong>, the promising <strong>Max Holloway, the 65V</strong> and 66V Jurgens Motorsport cars and Brendon Sharland &ndash; who is getting the bugs sorted from his Rees-built Spank.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Big fields are expected in other classes as well, as local drivers and visitors chase the season points titles.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dion Mooney has a 10 point advantage over <strong>Callum Sturzaker</strong> in the stockcar points, after missing two meetings while racing in the South Island, while in the adult ministocks, Bradley Korff has a handy lead over fellow Stratford driver Kyle Wilson, and in the youth ministock class, Flynn Wild is the meat in the points sandwich between leader Cody Hodge and his third-placed brother Seth Hodge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Grant Loveridge has dominated the production saloon class this season, and holds an unassailable lead in the points heading into the final night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A big crowd is expected at Oceanview Family Speedway, so the gates at the airport end of the facility will be open as well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There is additional parking available near the airport, and marshalls will direct the public.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gates open at 3pm and racing will start at 7pm. It promises to be an explosive end to the season.</p>
