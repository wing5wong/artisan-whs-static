<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her new series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big world.</strong></p>
<p>Former Whanganui High School student Thomas Matthews is the ultimate go-getter.<br />An idea that started when he got the "machinery bug" has been transformed into Matthews Agriculture, of which he is the founder and owner.</p>
<p>He established his successful planting, cultivation and grain harvesting business in 2015, while continuing to work for his parents, Bob and Cath Matthews, on their family farm and long-standing rose nursery.</p>
<p>Prior to launching his business, and initially unsure on the direct career path he would take, Mr Matthews fled to the United States for two years to work for a harvesting company.</p>
<p>"I got to see the scale of the farming they were doing over there and how they were utilising machinery," he said.</p>
<p>"American machinery is on a much larger scale to New Zealand."</p>
<p>Last year Matthews Agriculture - based just outside Whanganui off State Highway 3 - boomed after he started using fodder beet, a green feed crop.</p>
<p>"It is a specialised crop I was able to grow with a leased tractor and using the old man's planter," Mr Matthews said.</p>
<p>The business continues to grow but Mr Matthews said it wasn't all smooth sailing and there were always challenges.</p>

<p>"In the next few years one of the biggest challenges will be getting trained staff with an up-to-date machinery tech knowledge.</p>
<p>"Every year machinery is getting more and more automatic and it can be tough finding guys that want to stick around."</p>
<p>The advice he would give current students contemplating a career in farming would be to advance in any computer skills.</p>
<p>"It is important to be able to work with the information, such as working a GPS and field map, plus it will help bring something extra to the table," he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Farming is becoming all about data and the way you use it."</p>
<p>For students considering a career in farming Mr Matthews recommends spending 10 minutes on Google to do a bit of research.</p>
<p>"Farming in recent years has been more advertised with dairy but there is so much more out there - start researching</p>
<p>"If you are seeking a fun and rewarding career - and if you like the outdoors - this may be the career for you."</p>
