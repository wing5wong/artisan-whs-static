<p class="element element-paragraph">A dozen sets of eyes stare attentively at 15-year-old Whanganui High School student Annushka Forrest, standing at the front of their classroom.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'll say a line and then you say it back to me," Annushka says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Tu as un animal chez toi?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The children repeat the line, meaning "Do you have an animal at home?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Oui, j'ai un chat chez moi," Annushka follows up. "Yes, I have a cat at home."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is the fourth and final French lesson for Durie Hill School students, who accepted an offer from Whanganui High School French teacher Diana Ghinda to take part.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Week by week, Annushka has been visiting the school on a Friday for a half-hour slot teaching the alphabet, numbers, greetings and finally, animals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been a lot of fun watching their faces light up when they learn something new and it's helping to build my confidence in speaking French," Annushka says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In order to teach something, you have to know the material completely, especially with little kids who get restless so easily."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Annushka studied a little French at Whanganui Intermediate School before picking it up again in year nine.</p>
