<p class="element element-paragraph"><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/good-news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503279&amp;objectid=12112032">Che<span>erful music begins to play, hands start clapping to the rhythm and voices begin to sing along softly in a rendition of&nbsp;</span><em>It's A Small World After All.</em></a></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In this version, the lyrics aren't sung entirely in English, some of the verses are sung in Japanese by the 15 students stood in formation inside the Whanganui District Council.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They have been in Whanganui since Saturday, visiting from sister city Nagaizumi-cho in Japan to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the partnership between the two cities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Deputy mayor Jenny Duncan, chief executive Kym Fell, group co-ordinator Natasha McKee and sister city association members Emiko Tsuchiya and Shogo Hizawa watch on.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>McKee says that the 12 and 13-year-old students were hosted by</strong> Whanganui Girls' College and <strong>Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"On Monday and Tuesday they were hosted by the schools. They were in lessons with Kiwi students, they were involved in sport, cooking and MƒÅori cultural lessons," McKee said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a reciprocal learning opportunity. It was really good for the Kiwi students to engage with students from Japan and learn about Japanese customs."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Thursday the students went on a full day excursion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We went to Bushy Park, the Canaan Honey House on Mosston Rd and the Sarjeant Gallery where they had an art workshop and made their own souvenir bags," McKee said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They really enjoyed the honey farm because they got a demonstration and that was the first time they ever saw a beekeeper in all of his safety gear."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Last night the students had a farewell party at Whanganui High School</strong> and spent some time at the New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy before flying out today.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When the singing finishes, some upbeat music begins to play and traditional Japanese dress flies in all directions as the students begin performing a well-rehearsed routine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They receive a round of applause at conclusion. Duncan welcomes them all and explains the pictures of mayors along the walls and what the glass art inside represents.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In response, retired teacher Hizawa thanked the speakers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Thank you very much, I am very happy to have the opportunity to give my best to the people who have just spoken," Hizawa said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yesterday we went to Bushy Park and in the van, the students talked about their host families.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They talked about the food and the hosts and they were very happy with the friendly and kind atmosphere."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A group of adults from Nagaizumi-cho will visit Whanganui next. They are planning to travel over in January next year and to compete in the 2019 New Zealand Masters Games.</p>
