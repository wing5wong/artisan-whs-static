<p><strong>UP UP AND AWAY:&nbsp; Whanganui waterskier Lily Meade's leap last month at the annual Gold Star tournament at Lake Wiritoa has been confirmed to have altered the world rankings.</strong><br /><em>PHOTO / SABINA EAST</em></p>
<p>Former WHS student Meade, who won the overall under-17 competition, set a personal best 35.6m on the jump section, immediately recognised as a Central Region record.</p>
<p>Father Simon Meade was able to confirm that based on the 2017 ranking list, his daughter's <strong>jump was now in the</strong> <strong>top 20 of the world's under-17 females.</strong></p>
<p>"She's been working pretty hard to get there".</p>
