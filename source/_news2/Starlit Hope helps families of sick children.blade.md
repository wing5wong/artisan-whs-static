<p class="element element-paragraph "><br />One of Gabby Devine's wishes was to put a smile of the faces of children and families going through adversity, and it's safe to say a donation from her charity has done just that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Starlit Hope has donated $4000 worth of food and petrol vouchers to Whanganui Hospital, with the vouchers to go to families with children in hospital.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">The charity was started by Gabby in 2013 who was going through intensive chemotherapy, radiation, and major surgeries to fight a rare type of bone cancer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Gabby Devine died in 2015 age 13, but her vision has continued to grow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">The donation was part of the $10,000 raised at the annual Paul's Road music festival last month.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">The rest of the money raised has also been donated, going to three families with sick children.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">More than 500 people went along to the festival that had local bands playing alongside acts that travelled from Auckland and Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">Festival organiser and musician Kerry O'Sullivan said attendees had a great day and knew their proceeds were going to a good place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph ">"Gabby was my niece's child and she always talked about the importance of sharing a smile and showing kindness. It means a lot to help continue the work she started."</p>
