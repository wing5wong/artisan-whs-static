<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Winning gold has transcended the impact of energy-sapping jetlag on 17-year-old Whanganui heavyweight judoka Keightley Watson.</h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui High School teenager tasted success again at the Auckland International Competition winning three gold medals. Gold in both the cadet and junior men's grade are commonplace for Watson, but this time he recorded a first claiming gold in the senior men's division.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His weekend exploits came hard on the heels of arriving back in the country on Tuesday, July 24, after winning four medals in both the Hong Kong Asian Cup (cadets and junior men's) then the following week in the Macau Asian Cup, again in the cadets and juniors divisions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Ross Watson said the winning roll and subsequent medals countered any effects of jetlag.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson flew back to the Netherlands yesterday (August 1) for seven weeks of conditioning and training prior to competing at the Sydney International on September 23, then the New Zealand Championships along with possibly three other international overseas competitions prior to end of the year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Keightley will then return to the Netherlands at the end of the year, this time for training prior to competing in the Dutch Open Espoir held at Eindhoven where he won gold earlier in the year," Ross Watson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Keightley enjoys the training on offer in the Netherlands with his heavyweight mentor Grim Vuijsters and the intensity that it brings. His progress and results over the last 12 months are showing that it is paying off."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile younger sibling Callaghan Watson also had a successful weekend at the Auckland competition, but in the senior boys 66kg+ grade taking the bronze medal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He is now looking to build on this for North Island champs in August, then the Sydney International in September and New Zealand champs in October, which he will be competing at with his older brother," Ross Watson said.</p>
