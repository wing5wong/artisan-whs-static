<p><span><span>Allyssa Pram who will be singing along with Leigh-ana Hale in &lsquo;<em>The Tempest</em>&rsquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Year 12 students at <strong>Whanganui High School, Leigh-ana Hale and Allyssa Pram</strong>, will be dressed as Greek Goddesses singing a duet and solos in the production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play, <em>The Tempest</em>, which will be performed in the open air at the Bason Botanical Garden.</span></p>
<p><span>Both are taught singing by Lynn Whiteside, who recommended they accept the challenge</span><span class="text_exposed_show">. Both solos are performed early on in the play. Allyssa will sing, &ldquo;Where the bee sucks&rsquo; and Leigh-ana will sing &lsquo;Full Fathom Five.&rsquo; Their duet will be about advice given to two lovers soon to be married, to keep their distance from each other before the wedding.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">While this will be the first time the girls will have sung Shakespeare songs, both have had plenty of singing experience. Leigh-ana started singing in church and has had lessons for two years. Allyssa has been getting singing lessons for four to five years. Both are studying for the Advanced Concert Certificate which requires them to sing 30 minutes from memory in three different languages including English. Otherwise it has been singing at Amdram evenings and for senior citizen concerts. They have also been involved in High School productions including &lsquo;Rock of Ages&rsquo; performed in 2017.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Leigh-ana wants to get her ABRSM &ndash; an English Music qualification and then become a primary school teacher, with a focus on drama and music. Allyssa wants to continue with her music studies while at school but aims to get a job in the police force &ndash; the ultimate &lsquo;singing detective.&rsquo;</span></p>
