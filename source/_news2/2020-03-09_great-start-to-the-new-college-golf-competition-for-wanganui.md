Great start to the new College Golf Competition for Wanganui.  

We had 8 teams representing Cullinane, Whanganui Girls, Whanganui City College, Whanganui Highschool and Collegiate.  

Playing in Ambrose format the teams played six holes on our bottom course.  

Thank you to the teachers for your support of the coaching and new competition.  

The next rounds are on the 11th at Tawhero, 25th at Castlecliff, and then the final is back at Wanganui Golf Club on the 1st April.

Great work to our up and coming golfers at WHS. Thanks Mr Rivers for taking them! 💛🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♀️💚
