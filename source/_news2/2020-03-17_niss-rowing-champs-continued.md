Outstanding day on the water from our WHS Rowing Crew again today.  

Tomorrow is a huge day with 6 B Finals and 8 A Finals. 💚💛💚💛  

All the best for the final day at NISS at Lake Karapiro!!  

Great to see ex AWRC /Nga Tawa Rower Georgia Nugent-OLeary at the lake today who recently got selected for the NZ World Cup Women’s Quad.  ❤️💛❤️💛
