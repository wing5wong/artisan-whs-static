**Year 10 student, Amelia Neale played in the New Zealand Women’s Roller Hockey team at the Champions Cup 2019 Ladies Roller Hockey Tournament held in Brisbane, Australia on 2-5 October.**

Unfortunately, they did not come home with a medal, but were placed a tidy 4th against hard competition.

Amelia is the youngest on the team at only 14 years of age.

Prior to this tournament Amelia played for Wanganui in the Women’s team and the Mixed Youth Age team (of which she was the only female) at the New Zealand Nationals held in Whanganui at the end of September.

Her teams came 1st and 3rd respectively.

Great going Amelia, well done!
