<p>O&rsquo;Durkins Irish Band Playing at the Rosies Grand Irish Bar this weekend for St Patricks, including WHS staff member Carol Molan.</p>
<p>The O&rsquo;Durkins Irish Band has been playing Irish music for the past five years and as vocalist Pam says, &ldquo;Everybody can find a bit of Irish in themselves, especially on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; which falls on this Sunday, March 17. The band will be playing on Saturday from 6 to 8pm and on Sunday from 12 noon to 1.30pm.</p>
<p>The Grand is making it even more attractive to pop in on the weekend by offeri<span class="text_exposed_show">ng three beer and wine fridges to some lucky drinker on each of the days March 15 to 17. There will also be free giveaways such as T-shirts.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">At least four of the five members of the band can claim Irish ancestry and the fifth, Henry who plays the electric guitar and banjo, is from Canada. They are the only Irish band in the town and have developed a &ldquo;lovely loyal following,&rdquo; to their shows at the Grand Hotel, every second Sunday of the month from noon to 1.30pm.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The band consists of Pam on vocals, Chris on guitar and vocals, Bruce on penny whistle, <strong>Carol on her bodhran drum</strong> and Harry.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Pam says, &ldquo;We have a wide range of Irish songs from the traditional ballads to dance, gigs and reels, to the sad slow ones which you can cry to through to some not-quite-so traditional &ndash; in short something for everyone.</span></p>
