<p>The team was met with beautiful weather on day 1 then freezing, wet conditions on day two, however all skiing were completed.</p>
<p>With a young team and only two senior racers this was very much a rebuilding year for WHS. All students raced in both an Individual Giant Slalom and Dual Giant Slalom and gained valuable experience and tight racing. &nbsp;The team skied very well with standout performances by, Ali Gammeter, Vitek Sosnoski, Liam Lace and Josephine Verhaaren.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Winner &ndash; (female Skier) Josephine Verhaaren &ndash; Winning individual Giant Slalom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Winner &ndash; (male Skier) Liam Lace &ndash; Winning individual Giant Slalom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well done!&nbsp;</strong></p>
