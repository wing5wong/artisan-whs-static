<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Lily Claypole of WHS is the recipient of the Wanganui District Council Youth Committee Youth Recognition Award with her MP4 file on flash drive entry <em>Through a Glass Darkly.<br /></em><strong><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/166439157186971/videos/350118042152414/">Lily Claypole's winning moving image&nbsp;<em>"Through a Glass Darkly"</em></a></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The names of the 2018 Sarjeant Gallery Te Whare o Rehua Whanganui Arts Review Award winners have been announced.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Winners' names were made public at a function at the Whanganui War Memorial on Friday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A Whanganui selection panel chose 117 out of 149 entries to become part of the exhibition now showing at Sarjeant on the Quay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winning entries were then chosen by 2018 judge Karl Chitham - director of Tauranga Art Gallery.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is not too difficult to decide the winner of each category," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I look for the piece that keeps drawing me back."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winner of the $2000 Open Award 2018 is Kathryn Wightman for&nbsp;<em>Breathe</em>&nbsp;made from kiln formed glass using sintered glass powder.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I think of Whanganui, I think glass," said Mr Chitham.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But I didn't know the work was glass until I got really close to it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was the pattern that attracted me - it's like old wallpaper or carpet and I think we all get nostalgic about patterns."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Central City Pharmacy $1000 Excellence Award went to Lee Morgan for&nbsp;<em>les demoiselles; if only for one night</em>, made with tea bags, acrylic paint and ink.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Renata's Art &amp; Framing Merit Award went to 12-year-old Oscar Toy, for his pen on paper drawing&nbsp;<em>042</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was really surprised to discover the artist's age," said the judge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It looked to me as if it was done by someone with art school training and I liked that it is a drawing because drawings are becoming quite rare.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kay Benseman, was awarded the Friends of the Sarjeant Gallery Merit Award for her photographic print on archival paper&nbsp;<em>Speak up small red thing</em>&nbsp;(from Jenny Bornholdt's&nbsp;<em>Weighing up the Heart)</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Rivercity Picture Framers Merit Award went to Margaret Silverwood for her pencil, coloured pencil and watercolour on paper work&nbsp;<em>Hover</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Matt Dutton's acrylic on canvas work&nbsp;<em>Plymouth</em>&nbsp;earned him the Recaffeinate Merit Award and the Ceramic Lounge Merit Award went to Jonathon Cuff for his untitled mixed media entry.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHMilbank Gallery Merit Award went to Prakash Patel for his acrylic on canvas work&nbsp;<em>Immigrant</em>&nbsp;and Andre Br&ouml;nnimann received the Whanganui River Traders Merit Award for the oil on linen work&nbsp;<em>Wikitoria</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tracy Byatt's&nbsp;<em>Beauty is a Fading Flower</em>&nbsp;received the Wanganui Garden Services Ltd Merit Award.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I thought someone had made a mistake when I read that the flowers are made from sugar," said Mr Chitham.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They really are made from sugar and they are incredible."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>A video entry was chosen as the winner of this year's Wanganui District Council Youth Committee Youth Recognition Award.</strong></p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Lily Claypole is the recipient of that award with her MP4 file on flash drive entry&nbsp;<em>Through a Glass Darkly</em>.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 2018 Whanganui Arts Review is now in its 30th year, making it the longest running event of its type in the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui Arts Review Award finalists' work is open for viewing at Sarjeant on the Quay and the exhibition will run until May 13.</p>
