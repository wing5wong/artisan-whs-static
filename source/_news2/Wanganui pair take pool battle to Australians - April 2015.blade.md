<p>Wanganui Swimming Club prospects Elena Forlong (above<span>)</span>&nbsp;and <span>Shannon Schmanski&nbsp;</span>have touched down in Sydney with the Swimming NZ team for the start of the Australian Age Group Championships today.</p>
<p>Schmanski, 14, and Forlong, 16, qualified for the breaststroke and butterfly respectively, racing for New Zealand in the 100m and 200m events. They are part of the 12-strong crew, aged 13 to 16, who are mostly all attending their first significant international competition.</p>
<p>"I am very excited about the prospects and opportunities for this future crop of age group swimmers that are coming from all over New Zealand," head coach Gary Hurring said.</p>
<p>"We believe that we can set a pathway and culture within the squad, while racing against the Australians is always an exciting opportunity, and we are expecting this team to compete with confidence and desire."</p>
<p>The team should gain valuable experience ahead of the New Zealand Age Group Championships next month.</p>
<p>The championships run from today through to Saturday, at Sydney Olympic Park Aquatic Centre.</p>
