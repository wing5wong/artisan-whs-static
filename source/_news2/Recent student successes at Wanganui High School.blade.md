<p class="Body"><strong>Recent student successes at Wanganui High School, by Principal Mr Garry Olver.</strong></p>
<p class="Body">Dear Parents, Caregivers and Friends of the School,</p>
<p class="Body">Term three is rapidly passing by in our very busy school calendar.&nbsp; Many students are currently attending Winter Tournament Week at a number of venues located across the country representing the School at the highest level in their chosen sport.&nbsp; Thank you to all the volunteers who are accompanying them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Body"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Next week our senior students will be sitting their WHS examinations which are important in that they form the basis of students&rsquo; preparation for their final NCEA external exams in Term four.&nbsp; &nbsp;In all cases the results will be used to determine students&rsquo; provisional entry into their selected course for 2016.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="Body">&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It is once again a great pleasure to report on a few of the recent successes of our students in a wide array of co-curricular activities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>During the last School break our choir competed in the International Choral Festival in Sydney.&nbsp; This talented group of students were awarded a silver medal, just five points short of gold.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The 1<sup>st</sup> XV Rugby team completed their season playing in the Manawatu U21 Colts Division and were second only to Massey University, which is an admirable achievement.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The A1 Netball team competed in two competitions this season.&nbsp; On a Monday night they competed against adults in the Wanganui Premier League, making the final, but unfortunately coming second to Kaierau, a team they had beaten earlier in the season.&nbsp; In Manawatu they competed in the Secondary Open A Grade where they came fourth overall.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kia Waiora, our kapahaka group competed at both Manu Korero (Waimarama Matena placed third) and Paerangatahi.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jessica Watkin has been selected for the U18 NZ Indoor Cricket team.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Mathematics Department took a couple of teams to the Manawatu Mathex competition and achieved fourth equal.&nbsp; Three of our Year 13 students have been doing papers in Mathematics through Auckland University with Amaan Merchant topping the class.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Jeanne-Marie Bonnet achieved 90% in DELF Scholaire B1 (French) examinations, which is the penultimate stage of gaining entry to any French University.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is an exceptional achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">Student BoT election to find a Student Trustee for the following year, is currently underway.</p>
<p class="Body"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Over the last couple of weeks we had a large number of visiting students from China and Japan attend our School to improve their English Language skills.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Education Review Office (ERO) have just completed their review of the School, now awaiting their final report.</span></p>
<p class="Body">In all this is again a highly successful term for the students of WHS across all spheres of endeavour.</p>
<p class="Body">Best wishes,<br /> <br /> Garry Olver<br /> Principal&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
