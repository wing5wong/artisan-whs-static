<p>Whanganui father and son Peter and Liam Jones set a notable milestone in the 33rd Gazley Volkswagen Wellington Marathon at the weekend. They both lead the way for Whanganui runners in wet Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Several notable milestones were set by Whanganui runners and walkers at the 33rd running of the Gazley Volkswagen Wellington Marathon last week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For many of the more than 30 Whanganui, Rangitikei and South Taranaki competitors it was their debut at the annual event, but it was especially notable for the Jones family.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In atrocious conditions, father and son Peter and Liam Jones not only ran their first marathon at the same event, but<strong> Liam won the U19 men's race clocking 3.08.24</strong>. Peter contested the 50-59 men's age group event clocking 4.45.01, a handy time for a marathon debutante.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Liam Jones</strong> is now at Victoria University and running for Scottish Harriers. <strong>He won the Senior Boys Whanganui Secondary Schools Cross Country Championships and Senior Boys 3000m and 1500m in 2017 running for Whanganui High School.</strong> He has been a dedicated Wanganui Harrier Club member for almost a decade now.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mother Mandy Jones said her husband Peter had always wanted to make his marathon debut with her, but ill-health for many years prevented that.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I used to run half marathons and Peter and I had planned to run our first full marathon together but I have suffered ill-health for the past 30 or more years, so he decided to finally run his first at the weekend with Liam," Mandy Jones said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"His time was pretty good for a 57-year-old and especially in those conditions. There were 100kmh wind gust and rain, especially around Evans Bay. I don't know how Liam found the energy to sprint like he did at the end to win his race."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Evergreen harrier club runner (and WHS teacher)&nbsp;<strong>Mignon Stevenson&nbsp;</strong> <strong>won the 60-69 women's marathon run in 4.25.55.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui also had the Neva Beans team compete, a group of runners and walkers keen on the sport.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Neva Beans Leanne Allan, who is also a Wanganui Harrier Club athlete, won the 40-49 women's half marathon walk, cocking 2.25.18. Team mate (and former WHS student)&nbsp;<strong>Liam Brown</strong> <strong>was runner-up in the U20 men's 10km walk in 1.15.33</strong>, while Tina Redpath was third in the40-49 women's 10km walk in 1.20.34.</p>
