<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Secondary Schools are in the thick of Tournament Week competing in multiple sporting codes with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, few have been more successful than the Whanganui High School 1st XI boys' and girls' hockey teams in their respective competitions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHS girls were unbeaten in the first two days of play at the Chica Gilmer Trophy tournament at Rosa Birch Park in Pukekohe beating Auckland schools Rosehill College 3-1, Botany Downs 11-1 and Avondale 3-0 to make the Top 8. They were to play Rangitoto College late yesterday aiming to make the semifinals today and hopefully the final tomorrow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coached by Melissa Goff, the girls' 1st XI features a number of class players, including Rebecca Baker who has just been selected to attend the New Zealand under-18 women's development camp to be held December 15-21. Captained by Jacinta Manville, the side also includes Baker's younger sister Charlotte, who is also getting noticed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHS boys' 1st XI also made the Top 8 quarter-finals after two days of unbeaten play at the Founders Cup tournament in Palmerston North.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This team is captained by Jordan Cohen who was also selected for the New Zealand under-18 men's development camp and subsequently for NHL duty. The side also features Cohen's Central under-18 teammate Patrick Madder.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The lads are seeking to return to Rankin Cup/India Shield level after being demoted for finishing in the bottom six of that competition last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Manager Darrell Hoskin said they were making a great fist of things with two wins and a draw after day two.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We beat Wanganui Collegiate 3-0, then drew 1-all with Hutt International before beating Te Kura Kaupapa Maori o Ruamata from Auckland 3-0. We drew a tough pool, but still aiming to make the finals and ultimately return to Rankin Cup level," Hoskin said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The WHS A1 netball girls have had mixed fortunes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tackling Tournament Week competition in Palmerston North after finishing third in both the Netball Whanganui Premier A1 competition and the Manawatu secondary schools championships, was always going to be a tough effort.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, they began on Monday with a 46-23 win over Tawa College, followed by a 30-20 loss to New Plymouth Girls High on Tuesday morning before bouncing back for a close 31-27 victory over Queen Margaret College from Wellington in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Collegiate girls 1st XI hockey team have fared well, winning three from four encounters after day two on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They began with a whopping 7-1 win over Mt Albert Grammar in the Jenny Hair Trophy competition at the Trust House Hockey Complex in Carterton, followed by a 3-0 win over Pakuranga College. They only loss by the end of day two was a close 2-1 encounter with Marsden.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Play in these and other sporting codes during Tournament Week continue through until the weekend.</p>
