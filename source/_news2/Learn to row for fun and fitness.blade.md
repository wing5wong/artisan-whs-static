<p class="element element-paragraph">Aramoho Wanganui Rowing Club is starting a new programme to teach adults to row.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pedro Figueira is the head coach and the man in charge of the initiative.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to at least give the opportunity to people to [try] the sport in a way that is not as the majority of people see it, which is total commitment. I think commitment is important for the performance side of things, because that's the nature of the sport. But if you want to at least have the experience in the rowing boat, and just try it, you don't have to commit that much. We want people to have a go, then after that they can decide."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The programme is for adults aged 18 and over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What we're doing is completely new here, which is trying to give an opportunity to people to have a go."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pedro says social rowing, as it is called, is big in other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wanted to do this and I had a lot of support from the committee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The focus is not so much on the rowing but on the social side of things. It's a way to build a social life around a team sport."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a rowing boat the team has to move as one and every random movement by a rower has an instant effect on the rest of the crew. Pedro says that working that way builds a strong bond and encourages crew members to form friendships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You have to be synchronised and work together and that transfers to other skills in life, so for the kids that's very important, as it is for adults as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pedro wants to see crews made up of people from different backgrounds and professions, reaching circles seldom touched. He hopes they can influence their colleagues and friends to give rowing a try.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There is a fitness component to the programme.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If you are fitter you will enjoy the rowing itself," says Pedro. Mondays will focus on fitness while Saturdays will be spent on the water.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He says Whanganui is perfect for rowing because of its size &mdash; commuting times are minimal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're also trying to create awareness that there is a river out there and you can do things on the river.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I spend a lot of time on the river and it gives you a different perspective of the town. For me it's normal, but for other people it's a completely different experience."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pedro has worked in a lot of places but says Whanganui is the best place he has ever coached.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was Portuguese Rowing Federation national coach before coming to Whanganui in search of a lifestyle change and a better life for his children. His wife is English and the couple lived in the UK for seven years before returning to Portugal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The AWRC Adult Learn to Row Programme runs twice a week over six weeks, starting on Monday, May 21 6pm-7pm, and Saturday 9.30am-11.30am. Cost is $60. For enrolments and information email Pedro at figueirapedro@hotmail.com</strong></p>
