<p>Photo: Harvey Burke, 10, is all smiles as he hangs out with officer Joel Martin at the open day.</p>
<p>So this is how you bash a door down...</p>
<p>Ten-year-old Harvey Burke has been suited up for action at yesterday's open day at Whanganui's Bell St police station.</p>
<p>Officer and former WHS student Joel Martin is the one showing him the ropes.</p>
<p>Harvey was one of more that 1000 people who took advantage of the chance to look behind the scenes at police work.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Whanganui Police are thrilled with the huge response to their first-ever police station open day and hope they may have some new recruits lined up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Senior Constable Tanya Ross said they had expected about 1000 people would attend over the four hours the Bell St station was open to the public yesterday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But in the first hour-and-a-half we had 1000 people through," Ms Ross said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had over 2000 people through during the day. Obviously the good weather, heavy advertising and chance to see inside the station got people out. There were a lot of children with their families - it was a big family day."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The armed offenders squad and police dog displays were popular and people enjoyed the traffic section where they could get in a police car and turn on the siren.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They also liked being able to walk inside the Whanganui prison truck and see the compartments. The police cells were a huge interest and going through the police station."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Ross said there was "huge interest" in the recruitment display.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was really busy and we collected names and details on the recruitment list which we'll send off to our recruitment people in Wellington."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Neighbourhood Support Group and Victim Support talked to visitors about their services and Wanganui Community Patrol assisted police staff throughout the day and also cooked the sausage sizzle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was amazing - we had a really good day," Ms Ross said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Everything was positive and people were interested in seeing what it looks like inside the station. It's the first time we've had the doors open for this sort of thing and it's going to be an annual event."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All 24-hour police stations throughout New Zealand held open days yesterday.</p>
