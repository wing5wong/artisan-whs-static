<p><span>The Plumber Dan Raft Race on the Monday of Anniversary weekend raised nearly $2000 for Youth with Diabetes. The amount was boosted by the decision of all the prize winning teams to donate their money to the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>Linda Carter from Diabetes New Zealand, Wanganui Branch praised their generosity and says the money has/will be used to pay</span><span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;for local youth with diabetes to attend the Makahika Outdoors Pursuits Camp in Otaki and also for three families to go to a camp at El Rancho in Waikanae in March.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The winners were:<br />&bull; 1st place: Iron Ali Fitness<br />&bull; Best Costume: Thunderbirds are go<br />&bull; Best raft: Y raft ia and Root Brewery<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Organising the event and gaining support takes a lot of time and energy. Linda is grateful to the following companies who provided vouchers or product: Countdown, New World, Pak &lsquo;n Sav, H&amp;A, Flair 4 Hair, Nu Image Hair, Lazer Overload, Morrie Gibbons Signs, PGG Wrightsons, Springvale Garden Centre Caf&eacute;, Unichem Whanganui Pharmacy, Mainfreight Transport and Marine Services.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Clive Ward provided the sound services, Maori Wardens from Marton and Whanganui controlled the traffic, the Cancer Society arranged the sun screen stations and Volunteer Coastguard were there. The Lions Club collected donations, Miles Johnson took the photographs and the Rapid Relief Team did the BBQ, which raised $350 for the cause. Linda also thanks Sosoli Tawawadua, New Zealand Rugby Black Fern player, for participating.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">While disappointed that only 10 rafts entered compared with 24 last year, Linda says the switch to having it over Vintage Weekend, was probably the main reason. People were too busy. Plumber Dan is looking to running the event later next year.</span></p>
