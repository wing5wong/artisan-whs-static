<p><span>HUNGRY: WHS teacher, Colin Hedivan poses with Audrey II as it devours a fluffy-slippered <span>(former WHS student)&nbsp;</span>Shaila Hawkins. <br />PICTURE / Paul Brooks.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Strange things are happening at Amdram Theatre in Guyton St. There's a plant, and it's growing, taking over ... and eating people.</span><br /><em></em></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Little Shop of Horrors</em></strong><span>&nbsp;has come to town and it starts on stage at Amdram this Friday.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Colin Hedivan, who is also head of drama at Whanganui High School, is directing the musical.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"I directed Little Shop of Horrors 11 years ago at a high school I worked at in Canada, and it was the most fun I've ever had directing a show. So I've been waiting for the right opportunity to do it somewhere else. I've always wanted to do it in Whanganui but it was a matter of being available. I pitched it to Amdram and they said, let's do it."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The plant, Audrey II, is the star.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"She's ugly, but beautiful," says Colin.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"Progressively the plant gets bigger through the show," he says, so we looked at all four versions, number four being the one pictured.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>It starts as a pot plant, albeit an odd-looking one. Then it grows through three other versions on stage ... and it moves, seeking living human flesh.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yvonne Jones' craftsmanship is evident in the first two versions and husband Ian helped her with version three. The final, and most carnivorous version is the work of a team of designers and builders. Ian Jones, Terry Lobb, Geoff Campbell and Kirk Nicholls contributed to the chicken wire, mattress rubber and various ingredients that went into the monster plant.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>They were advised by Lee Williams who has worked for Weta Workshops (among many other arts and costume related things).</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Audrey II even has dialogue.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"The voice of the plant is spoken from off-stage and we have a puppeteer inside, so the two of them work in collaboration to create the effect of the plant."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>Dylan Peterson is the voice of the full-grown plant and Phil Portland is puppeteer.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The cast consists of <strong>Shaila Hawkins</strong> (Audrey - after whom the plant is named), Chris Pedley (Seymour), Dwight Ballard (Mr Mushnik) and Richard Leith (six characters, including the sadistic dentist).</span><br /><em></em></span></p>
<p><span><em>Little Shop of Horrors</em><span>&nbsp;is Shaila's last show in Whanganui before leaving to study for a BA in Music and Theatre Studies at Waikato University.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>"Our three narrators, the Doo-Wop girls are played by three high school students - Cypress Kani-Hurinui, Ali Gammeter and Abby Squire</strong> - a Year 10, a Year 11 and a Year 12 student. It was written for a small cast and a small orchestra. Although there are 16 characters in the show, all 16 are played by only eight actors on stage."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The music, written by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, will be played by an orchestra consisting of Lynn Whiteside, Errol Christiansen and Abby Livesay.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"It's been an incredible team that's put this entire show together, it really has."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>And it's a musical.</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>"The music is 1950s rock and roll doo-wop influenced," says Colin. "It's odd material for a musical, if you think about it. A plant comes down from outer space and feeds on human flesh. But it's so catchy and so funny. It's this weird combination of science fiction, melodrama and realism."</span><br /></span></p>
<p><strong>The show is running from September 15 to 30, weekends only, Friday to Sunday. <br />Tickets from Royal Whanganui Opera House.</strong></p>
