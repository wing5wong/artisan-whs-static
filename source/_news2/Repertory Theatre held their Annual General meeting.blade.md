<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />Wanganui Repertory Theatre recently held their Annual General Meeting in which Phil Hudson was returned as President. It was a wellattended meeting and these officers were elected: Justin Mulligan treasurer, Cathy Gribble secretary while the committee is comprised of Jessica Alder, Beverley Pearce, Nadine Rayner, April Pearson, Bridget Hurley, <strong>Brie Parkinson and Reid Tucker</strong>&nbsp;(both former WHS students).</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Following the meeting an afternoon tea was enjoyed by all, which our patron Thelma Good attended.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">A cast and crew are rehearsing Ugly Customers, written by Wellington playwright Joe Musaphia, a name that will be very familiar to many, particularly the older generation as Joe was a columnist for Wellington&rsquo;s Evening Post for many years.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ugly Customers is a very witty play but we&rsquo;ll have to wait a little longer to see it as due to unforeseen circumstances production dates have been put back three weeks. The new dates are: opening night is Friday, May 31, followed by June 1, 6, 7 and 8, starting at 7.30pm. A matinee performance will be presented on Sunday, June 2.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Do go and see it. As well as being very funny it has a lot to say about the way people regard banks and how some banks treat their customers, which makes for very entertaining theatre.</p>
