<p class="element element-paragraph">Many have the ability take their skills out to the wide world, but it takes real talent to be recognised as 'world famous in Whanganui'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was a lot of emotion in the voice of proud mother Maureen Johnson when she stood on the dais at the Wanganui Function Centre to accept the platitudes for son Earl Bamber at the 2018 Ray White Whanganui Sports Awards on Friday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bamber had sent a grainy cellphone video from the streets of Macau, where he is competing at the 2018 FIA GT World Cup for Porsche, to thank the audience for his International Sportspeson of the Year award.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 28-year-old singled out those who had been members of the Wheels Trust and Club 500 that gave financial backing to the-then teenager Bamber to go out on the world stage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was people there that helped me as a young person to achieve my dream," said Bamber, who is well respected throughout both Northern and Southern Hemisphere motor racing circles, but had yet to receive an award in his home town.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whanganui has good talented sportspeople and Earl identifies [with that]," said Johnson after the video played</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He is truly indebted to Club 500."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But mum had only just got back to her seat when she had to stand up again as Bamber then received the biggest prize of the night &ndash; the Supreme Award &ndash; which is decided from all the category winners.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Wow," she exclaimed, in a voice beginning to shake.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We, his family, are really proud of his racing career, but Whanganui can be just as proud of celebrating his success."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Johnson said her on all of her son's social media platforms, which are extensive, he uses the handle of being proudly from New Zealand and Whanganui, wherever he goes in the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He lives on a farm above Jerusalem on the Whanganui River."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was similar pride expressed at the start of the night with the newest inductees to the Whanganui Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The wife and grandson of the late Charlie Phillips, who passed away in 2003, were honoured to accept his induction for an outstanding softball career as a player, administrator and referee, who has a lasting legacy as it was Phillips who introduced the game to teeball to New Zealand, which hundreds of Whanganui children were playing less than 12 hours later in Gonville.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He left his mark locally, nationally and internationally," said Mrs Phillips.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He went about everything he did quietly and thoroughly, without looking for reward."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Phillips was also remembered by fellow inductee Robin Hood, who was only a year older than him, who said they both shared a "closeness to sport".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Having travelled back from his home in Albany, Hood was delighted to accept his induction for a lifetime in high board diving administration &ndash; like Bamber, it is a sport not so well known in his home town despite the fact Hood has received many national and international awards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has been said, quite correctly, there is no such thing as a self-made person," said Hood, who thanked his wife, his late coach Merv Campbell and everyone who had ever given him encouragement.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hood told the story about joining the Wanganui Swimming Centre in 1959, and then because of the actions of an official, he was robbed of a bronze medal at the national championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was muddled thinking, but it was sincere &ndash; they were sincerely wrong."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That memory no doubt played a part in Hood's determination to become a competent official, referee and diving judge, a role he performed a dozens of Olympics, Commonwealth Games, and world championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A special memory was when he was referee at the 3m Board Men's Final at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, with his mentor Campbell acting as a judge &ndash; two men from Whanganui and Hamilton out on the world stage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"And it all began here, in this city, for which I have a deep, profound love," Hood said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Thank you all for this honour, I shall never forget it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It shall remain with me, for my remaining days of life."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Like Bamber, there was a video acceptance for the<strong> International Junior Sportsperson of the Year and it came all the way from the West Indies where White Fern Jessica Watkin was attending the ICC Women's Twenty20 World Cup.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watkin, who finally broke into the national side this year and earned a professional NZC contract, thanked long-time coach Dilan Raj and personal trainer Ebony Kerr, who received the award on her behalf.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The spin bowler and attacking batswomen also gave warm thanks to her family.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They've been there this whole time, so thank you and miss you from the Caribbean.</p>
<p>"In the Caribbean, so [audience] have a rum to celebrate, congrats to all the winners."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">United's veteran spin bowler Martin Pennefather also had words of wisdom for young sportspeople and that's to stick at their chosen code, given he earned his first 'Black Cap' with the New Zealand Over 50's team this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You get to a certain age and you don't expect to be called up to a national side, or expect an award like this," said the Masters Award winner.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I knew if I kept playing cricket, something good would happen."</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><span><strong>Hockey's Andrew Spence had his thoughts on his players who "make him look good" after he went up to accept the Coach of the Year award after his team finally won the Under 15 Boys national championship.</strong></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"It's really important for me to understand is that it's quality around you that makes the difference."</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although many in the room may have misheard the citation for Wanganui Bowling Club's Dianne Patterson, Lesley Bourke and Karen Hunt, they were deserving winners of the Senior Team of the Year award after claiming the Bowls NZ Club Championship National triples title.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a long process that including winning the local qualifiers against the other Whanganui clubs, and then the regional competition and ultimately the nationals in Brown's Bay against the other champion teams over two days and five rounds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That the veteran Patterson-skipped team was also able to claim the title against the best given Bourke and especially Hunt were academy-level players is a very unique achievement.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Patterson and Bourke also finish fourth in the pairs at the same nationals and some members of the audience may have only heard that specific number announced on the night, without realising the national triples title was the high water mark.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To achieve this award is absolutely wonderful," Patterson said as the Wanganui BC team accepted the prize.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was less rancour in the choice of Junior Team of the Year, which was the dominant Collegiate sprint relay team of Jenna Maples, Tayla Brunger, Emma Osborne, Ana Brabyn and Georgia Matson.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Collegiate sprinting captain Grace Godfrey accepted the award and thanked their coach Alec McNab for all his efforts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It develops a team sport and it develops us as sprinters.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The hours you put in is something I haven't seen anywhere in sport."</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">The National Junior Sportsperson of the Year Rebecca Baker kept her remarks on point, as the senior national-championship winning hockey player thanked her parents, siblings, conditioning coach Greg Fromont and all her Whanganui High School coaches.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As repeat National Senior Sportsperson of the Year, rower Luke Watts thanked departed Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club coach Pedro Figueira and his AWRC team mates, who won gold with him at NZ Rowing Championships in double sculls and coxless quad sculls, while Watts also got the single scull gold.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"We had quite a good season and won when it counts," he said.<br /><br /></span></p>
