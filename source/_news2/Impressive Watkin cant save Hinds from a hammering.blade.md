<p>Whanganui's White Fern Jessica Watkin impressed with the ball against the touring Indian Women's team, but it wasn't enough to prevent a 138 run hammering for her Central Districts Hinds in Napier on Friday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Playing at Nelson Park, India won the toss and chose to bat, and put on 217-9 from their 50 overs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With her spinners, Watkin was the pick of the bowlers, taking 4-34 with two maidens from her 10 over spell.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Two of those wickets came in the 44th over, with another in the 46th, to reduce India to 191-9 before the final pair had a late flourish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rosemary Mair was the other strong bowler of the eight used at the crease, taking 3-28 from her ten overs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, in reply, the Hinds were bundled out for just 79 in the 32nd over.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coming in at No3, Watkin started well, making 17 from 19 balls including hitting two boundaries over the top, but was then caught behind to trigger a collapse where the Hinds lost their last eight wickets for 45 runs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">India's Poonam Yadav took 4-6 from her 5.4 overs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Former Wanganui women's captain Esther Lanser made 16 as she tried to bat with the tail, before becoming one of Yadav's victims.</p>
