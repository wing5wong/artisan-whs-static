<p data-bind="text: $data">Jayne Fields and WHS student, Tori Whibley play Geraldine and Alice &mdash; the vicar and the verger &mdash; in Amdram&rsquo;s production of the Vicar of Dibley.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><br />&lsquo;I&rsquo;m enjoying working with Jayne. I couldn&rsquo;t have found anyone better to work with,&rdquo; says Tori.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the same,&rdquo; says Jane. &ldquo;Even from when we went to the auditions . . . it&rsquo;s pretty perfect we ended up together.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The characters &mdash; and, it seems, the actors &mdash; share a special relationship, a focus for the rest of the action.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no lead in this show: every character is pivotal and strong,&rdquo; says Jayne.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Tori and Jayne are no strangers to the local stage.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;The first time I did something was Grease at the Opera House,&rdquo; says Jayne.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Her next role was in I Love You, You&rsquo;re Perfect, Now Change; then Blithe Spirit at Repertory.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;But I tend to do things at Amdram, because I love it. My eldest daughter grew up within Amdram and did a lot of singing, so we&rsquo;ve always been quite connected to the theatre. I&rsquo;ve just been lucky enough to do more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She says Whanganui allows people the opportunity to do such things.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Jayne&rsquo;s father was a huge fan of the TV show, Vicar of Dibley, and the roles of Geraldine and Alice were close to her heart. &ldquo;In my late teens, French and Saunders was a huge thing for me, so I thought, this is right: give it a go. And I was really lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">For Tori, this is her first real involvement in theatre, although she has performed at school and has been seen on local stages as a sun zipping across the sky and as a comedic stage hand.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;This is my first role with lines, so this is a big step for me and it&rsquo;s quite nerve-racking.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Tori says she&rsquo;s comfortable with the cast, who are all supportive, and in such an environment she feels able to show what she has to give as an actor. &ldquo;Everyone is so nice, and all they give is constructive criticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She is trying to keep Alice as much like the TV character as possible.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;These characters sit really close to people&rsquo;s hearts,&rdquo; says Jayne. &ldquo;And Chris [McKenzie, director] is really cool. He&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;You go for it, and if I like it, you won&rsquo;t hear me&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s very good to work with.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I like that he gets genuinely excited when he&rsquo;s directing, to the point where he&rsquo;s laughing and clapping. He gives you energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;And he gives lots of reactions, as well,&rdquo; says Tori.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">As in the TV show, Geraldine tells jokes that Alice doesn&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;Some of them go over my head anyway,&rdquo; says Tori, &ldquo;So I feel like the character sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;The comedy just flows with gags and interactions all the time,&rdquo; says Jayne.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Both agree that while some of the jokes could be considered &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s directed smoothly, sensitively and respectfully.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for Whanganui to see it: it&rsquo;s going to be so much fun,&rdquo; says Jayne. &ldquo;I just wish I could watch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">This is Tori&rsquo;s last year at secondary school and there are stressful months to come, so while a show later in the year might be too hard, she would like to do something over Christmas. She leaves Whanganui next year to pursue tourism studies in New Plymouth.</p>
