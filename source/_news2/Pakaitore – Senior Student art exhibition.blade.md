<p><br /><span>Senior students from Whanganui Girls College, Rangitikei College, Whanganui High School and the UCOL Certificate of Art and Design are participating in an exhibition called &lsquo;Pakaitore&rsquo; at the Whanganui Community Art Centre on Taupo Quay. It opened on May 17 and continues through to May 26.</span></p>
<p><span>There are close to 70 art works on display ranging from acrylic, paintings, photography and a variety of print forms. For the secondary school stud</span><span class="text_exposed_show">ents it was a chance of passing level 2 and 3 NCEA achievement standards which requires them to produce a finished work and have it displayed in an exhibition. <strong>Glen Hutchings, Art Teacher at Whanganui High School, said that the work was of exceptional quality.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The theme was Pakaitore, following on from the 2018 theme of Parihaka. Over term one, the students were required to study the background to Pakaitore and to prepare a preliminary compositional study before completing their final art work.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The student work is of a high standard and very different approaches have been taken. There is a selection of Greek vase inspired works which might indicate an overlap with Classical Studies. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The RCP recommends the following:<br /><strong>&bull; Jacob Ruscoe&nbsp;</strong>- Broken Contract, wood cut.<br /><strong>&bull; Grace Swanston</strong> &ndash; The Crown Takes All, acrylic on board.<br /><strong>&bull; Jared Ball</strong> &ndash; Photographic Collage.<br />&bull; Vicki Palmer &ndash; Stumped, Rangitikei College, woodcut.</span></p>
