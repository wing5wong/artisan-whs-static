<p><span>This year WHS just took the boys team to National tournament in Palmerston North as the girls team is rebuilding after losing a lot of senior&nbsp;players&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The boys were placed in a higher division than 2017, reflecting their good performance the previous year.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>On the first day they had two loses; against Hillcrest High School and Marlborough Boys College,&nbsp;but picked up the next day to have a good win against Onehunga High School and then had&nbsp;a narrow loss to Scotts College.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>On the third day of the tournament they had two good wins against Rosmini College and Te Puke College.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The Thursday saw them suffer a loss to Elim Christain School and then they came away with a win against Burnside High School.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>On the last day they played off for 5th and 6th out of the 16 teams in their division, winning over Waimea College in 4 sets.</span></p>
<p><span>It was a huge event to be involved in with over 170 teams.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The boys improved their seeding by 11 placings from last year.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The boys were great ambassadors for the school and ended up with a lot of support from other teams, due to their friendliness and good sportsmanship.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to Pac &amp; Save for their help with food, it was&nbsp;greatly appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you also to their coach Iliesa Tamaniyaga and his family for all their support.&nbsp; Unfortunately there was a gastroenteritis virus going around the tournament which affected most of the teams and one of our players and&nbsp;Iliesa ended up in hospital.&nbsp; We send our best wishes to Iliesa and his family and hope he is home soon.</span></p>
