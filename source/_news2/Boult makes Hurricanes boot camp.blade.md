<p>Adam Boult who played for Whanganui High School last year has made the 2017 Hurricanes U18 camp in Masterton this month.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Out of 293 nominations from schools around the catchment, there were 58 players selected to attend the training camp at Rathkeale College from July 9-13.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Manawatu's traditional powerhouse Feilding Ag High School had their usual strong selection with six players chosen, which includes former WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Griffin Culver </strong>and Kody Edwards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Halfback<strong> Culver </strong>was an Under 18 rep last year and a standout at Whanganui High School as part of their Mixed Touch national title-winning team and the WHS 1st XV which narrowly lost the Manawatu Colts final to regular winners Massey White.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Also going to the camp, Wanganui U18 fullback Adam Boult played alongside both Edwards and Culver, being a Cullinane player who was lent to WHS 1st XV last year in a special arrangement between the schools.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He is now at the Te Kawau club while he attends Massey University.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Edwards, Culver and Boult have been to the Hurricanes camps in previous years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The five day camp will see the players coached by current Hurricanes Investec Super Rugby coaching staff and professional players, as well as receiving guidance off the field in terms of nutrition, mental skills, physical preparation, media and leadership training.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The week will culminate in a training match between a "Coles XV" and the "Perenara XV", who will be coached by former All Black captain Rodney So'oialo and former NZ Sevens star Tafai Ioasa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A squad of 23 will then play a one-off match with the Crusaders Under 18's in the curtain raiser to the Super Rugby game between the franchises at Westpac Stadium on July 15.</p>
