<p class="element element-paragraph">Former WHS student Chris Harris is one of the four Aramoho Rowers named in NZ team for world champs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Four Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club (AWRC) rowers have been named in seats for New Zealand crews.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While all the media attention has centered around superstars like Mahe Drysdale, the hard-working Whanganui rowers have thoroughly earned their spots for teams to compete at the September 9-16 world championships in Bulgaria.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Double Olympic single sculls champion Drysdale lost that spot, but earned a seat in the quad, taking the seat of Jordan Parry. Drysdale last raced a crew boat for New Zealand at the Athens Olympics, when he finished fifth in the coxless four.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">AWRC rowers <strong>Chris Harris</strong>, Martyn O'Leary and the Gowler sisters Kerri and Jackie have either retained their seats from previous world class competition, or moved into new spots.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Harris</strong> has again been named in the double sculls alongside John Storey under coach Calvin Ferguson, who also has Whanganui links. He spent the best part of his rowing and early coaching career in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Harris and Storey just missed out on the medals at the World Cup III regatta in Lucerne in July, finishing fourth in the men's double sculls final. The pair are the defending world champions having won in 2017.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerri Gowler has again been named in the coxless pair with regular partner Grace Prendergast under the watchful eye of coach Gary Hay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gowler and Prendergast took out the women's pair in Lucerne to retain the pair's unbeaten streak stretching back to last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Younger sister Jackie Gowler has a seat in the elite women's eight under coach Dan Kelly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jackie Gowler won gold with the women's eight in Lucerne, which was one better than the silver the team won at World Cup II.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">O'Leary joins the men's eight for the world championships in Bulgaria. O'Leary and his Kiwi crew won the coxed four at the 2016 under-23 world rowing championships in Rotterdam.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In recent years since moving from Whanganui, he has represented the Waikato RPC.</p>
