As a large diverse and fully inclusive school, there is student interest in setting up a LGBTQ+ (Rainbow) group at Whanganui High School - I am fully supportive of this happening. We will:

* Fly the Pride (Rainbow) flag on our flagpole tomorrow;
* Have a 'Wear a rainbow accessory day' tomorrow; students will still be in full school uniform but allowed to wear rainbow accessories for the day such as rainbow pins, badges, ribbons, bracelets.  

Thanks very much for supporting our community,

Martin McAllen  
Principal  
Whanganui High School
