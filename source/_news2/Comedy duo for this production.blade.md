<p class="element element-paragraph">Ethel and Cecil are sisters from a Taranaki dairy farming family who are responsible for the continuity throughout Repertory Theatre's upcoming production of&nbsp;<em>Dick Whittington and His Cat</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They sing, crack jokes and encourage audience participation. I thought Cecil, played by Maddi McKenzie should be "Cecilia", but I was told no, her farming family wanted a son so "Cecil" it is.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Maddi's been involved in theatre since she was six so has already acquired an impressive theatrical resume. As well as appearing in several Amdram and Repertory Theatre productions she's also directing an intermediate play for Amdram's Starlets group. Not only has she taken part in Wanganui Intermediate School plays (Queen of Hearts in&nbsp;<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>) and Wanganui High School plays, Maddi played parts in both of the recent Shakespeare in the Park productions. She was Banquo's son Fleance in&nbsp;<em>Macbeth</em>&nbsp;and Iris in&nbsp;<em>The Tempest</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As Cecil, Maddi plays the younger, but much smarter sister.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Cecil reads the situation accurately. Although Ethel tries to control her, Cecil's no pushover," Maddi said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ashlyn Morris plays the part of older sister Ethel.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She's quite funny," says Ashlyn. "Ethel aspires to be an opera singer but she's really a terrible singer, which is quite a hoot. She doesn't realise how bad she is. She cares for her younger sister and is quite protective of her, but at the same time is afraid of being overshadowed by her."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Theatre's been an important part of Ashlyn's life since she was four. She's 29 now so that's a quarter of a century spent treading the boards. She's kept busy gaining two degrees, one in social work and one in performing arts while continuing her involvement in community theatre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ashlyn and Maddi seem happy working together. They'll give the panto that upbeat vibe that all pantomimes thrive on.</p>
