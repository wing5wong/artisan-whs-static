<p><span><span><span><br />Bouquet of the week: Pharmacy 145 staff</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We got the following email from &lsquo;Impressed.&rsquo;</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;I came across a distressed citizen stuck in the middle of the footpath in Victoria Avenue. His mobility scooter had a flat battery and he wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere. What to do?&nbsp;</span><br /></span></p>
<p><span><span>The staff in the nearby pharmacy rose to the occasion. They were willing helpers. Communication was tricky, but they soon worked out who to contact. The scooter was pushed into the pharmacy where it was warm and the&nbsp;</span><span class="text_exposed_show">problem eventually resolved.<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">I wish to commend the staff of the Pharmacy 145 for their willingness to assist, their kindness and caring and helpfulness. It gladdened my heart.&nbsp;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">They are certainly deserving of a Bouquet of the Week.&rdquo;<br /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span class="text_exposed_show">The staff received a beautiful bouquet of flowers put together by Nichola and her team at the Flower Room, an Inter Flora Top 20 Club member. The flowers will remain at the pharmacy. They also received a voucher for lunch for two at the Grand Irish Pub.</span></span></p>
