<p>Whanganui High School Rowing Grocery Grab fundraiser was a great success on Sunday morning at New World. Winners, Kylie Tasker and Trevor Tutty, had four minutes to go around the shop to fill their trolleys up to the value of $500 each. They had won this by buying a $10 ticket to support Whanganui High School Rowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kylie and Trevor completed their Grocery Grabs individually and at separate times, one after the other. Organ<span class="text_exposed_show">iser, Kate Zander-Thomson said, &ldquo;The Grab took place at 9am on Sunday morning, so we had to warn a couple of regular shoppers there were to be a few minutes of madness!&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Kate adds, &ldquo;Both Kylie and Trevor had a bit of a plan, having each popped in for a wander down the aisles during the week, with some specific items in mind. However, they both agreed that the time went very quickly and it was a bit trickier than initially anticipated. Both winners were pleased with their grabs and thought it a great prize.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Neither winner amassed more than the $500. However, if they had, there was the choice of placing some items back, or paying the extra cost.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The committee made approximately $2,700 after outgoings from the raffle, with New World Wanganui sponsoring 1 trolley.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The High School rowers compete locally and nationally at regattas across the country during the rowing season which is currently under way. The money raised goes towards costly equipment that is required for this sport. The High School Rowing committee would like to thank everyone who participated in this fundraiser, particularly Wanganui New World, our major sponsor.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The fundraiser is likely to be repeated next year &ndash; so get prepared.</span></p>
