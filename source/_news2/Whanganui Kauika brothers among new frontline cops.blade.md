<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui woman Anne Kauika can be very proud of her two sons Riki and Josh.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Riki Kauika is a former national golfing representative and the other has spend 12 years in the navy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now their careers have stumbled on to the same pathway; they both just graduated from police college in Wellington last week. And they both took out awards as they did so.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Very [proud], yeah definitely," said Anne Kauika.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They're great boys and it was very cool to go down to their graduation on Thursday and they are very happy young men actually.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's really cool to see them really excited about going into the police force, it's awesome."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Constable Riki Kauika was given the Driver Training and Road Policing Practice Award, while Constable Joshua Kauika took the prize for Physical Training and Defensive Tactics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Kauika brothers also have an aunt who was in the police for a few years, based in Taumarunui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"I think they'll make really good policemen actually," Anne said.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Anne Kauika said Riki probably preferred to be on the beat and he'd want to get a good feel for the job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's probably a quieter man than what Josh is - but in saying that he will be a very good community policeman. Plus he's got a very technical head on his shoulders from all the golf he's played.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have no doubt he'll probably end up playing golf for the police as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said Josh's years in the navy meant he would be able to be called upon by the police dive squad if needed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has already worked with the police in search and rescue operations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But, like Riki, it was likely Josh would first do a few years on the beat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Josh will start his work in Northland while Riki will be deployed to the Central District.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Kauika brothers graduated alongside 77 other new constables at The Royal New Zealand Police College on Thursday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The new constables are aged between 18 and 50 and began their studies in September.</p>
