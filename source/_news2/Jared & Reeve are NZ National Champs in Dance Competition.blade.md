<p><strong>Jared Sim (16) and Reeve Watson (13) with their medals gained for the 14 National titles won (3 titles are from Adult gradings) from the New Zealand National Open One Dance Championships at Te Rauparaha Arena in Porirua held over Saturday 1 and Sunday 2 June 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>They won 14 NZ National Open One Dance Titles over the weekend against both youth and adult classes, in their level and in levels higher than their own. They also won numerous placings (19 x 2nds, 24 x 3rds) in various levels over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A highly successful weekend of dance for them both, considering they just started dancing Youth and Adult in March this year!</p>
