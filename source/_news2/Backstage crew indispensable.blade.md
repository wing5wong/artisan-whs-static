<p>An army of backstage crew members keeps any on stage production afloat.&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood's</em>&nbsp;backstage crew numbers more than the on-stage cast, which isn't an unusual situation.</p>
<p>Lizz and Phil Hudson, along with apprentice cabinet maker San Julian have spent hours set building, dressing the set and creating props. The set's looking great too.</p>
<p>Students Sam Wright, Kalib Matthews, Ronan Shaw, Rebecca James and Madison Portland-Cole have clocked up an impressive range of theatre experience between them, despite their youth.</p>
<p>Currently a student of Otago University, Sam Wright is helping with scene changes. He's stage managed Whanganui High School (WHS) productions, various Starlets productions and&nbsp;<em>Macbeth</em>&nbsp;in February of this year. When asked if he'd like to be on stage his response was, "No. I'm not an actor. I like to be running the show."</p>
<p>Sam's worked closely with Kalib Matthews in earlier productions where Kalib has been his assistant stage manager. They worked together in Annie and the stage challenges at the Regent Theatre in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>Ronan Shaw has stepped in to assist to assist backstage too. He enjoyed playing the Bandersnatch in a school production of&nbsp;<em>Jabberwocky</em>. "I'd have auditioned for a role in&nbsp;<em>Little Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;if I'd found out about it in time," he says.</p>
<p>Rebecca James is another crew member who's having fun backstage. Another former WHS student, Rebecca's also worked behind the scenes for their productions:&nbsp;<em>Crazy For You</em>,&nbsp;<em>Annie</em>&nbsp;and the independently produced&nbsp;<em>Macbeth</em>&nbsp;at Bason Botanical Gardens in February. "I used to perform music, playing piano, but it's more exciting backstage. I like watching everyone else go on stage but being back stage I can still be involved."</p>
<p>Daughter of well known local actor and director Phil Portland, Madison Portland-Cole is in charge of the sound effects for&nbsp;<em>Red Riding Hood</em>. Only 16 years old, this student has gained the respect of the theatre community for her capable management of front of house duties. She's also helped out backstage for previous productions like&nbsp;<em>The Rivals</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Doll's House</em>. "Just doing a bit of everything really, helping out. Doing sound is a new experience. Everything looks different from the sound/ lighting box and the sound effects make it a lot funnier," she says. The future? "I'd like to be on stage, definitely, eventually stage managing or directing. Really I just want to have fun."</p>
<p>Fun it is, and all made possible with the time commitment backstage crew so willingly give. Thank you team!<br /><em></em></p>
<p><em>Red Riding Hood</em>&nbsp;opens this Friday at 6.30pm. Check your local newspaper for more details.</p>
