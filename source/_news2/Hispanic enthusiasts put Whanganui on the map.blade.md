<p><strong>Whanganui's Hispanic enthusiasts Marilyn Wilkie (back row left), Antonio Salas, Beverley Stuart, Andrea Gardner (front left) and Queralt Scott.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Latin America &amp; Spain Film Festival opens in Whanganui on Thursday starting with&nbsp;<em>Son of the Bride (El Hijo de la Novia)</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>No Filter (Sin filtro)</em>&nbsp;will screen next Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The free festival has now been running in New Zealand for 15 years and while other towns of similar size miss out, Whanganui audiences get to host the festival thanks to a group of Hispanic enthusiasts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Queralt Scott from Barcelona moved here with her Whanganui-born husband and their children after living in Majorca and she teaches Spanish at Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Antonio Salas has lived in Whanganui for seven years with his wife and two children and is keen for people to know more about his homeland of Chile.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Andrea Gardner is well-known in the community as an artist and art educator and many of her works have been inspired by residencies in Mexico, Colombia and Bolivia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Beverly Stuart lived for 12 years in Peru and has run many trips to Peru for locals and students.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The final member of the group is Marilyn Wilkie, who, along with Queralt and Beverly, has been a Spanish teacher at Whanganui High School.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Wilkie and Ms Stuart are currently working on a South American recipe book.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This will be the fourth year the group has brought the film festival to Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Wilke says the group was delighted to see the All Blacks recently caught on Twitter ordering hot chocolate and green tea in Spanish at a caf&eacute; in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We organise the festival to encourage other New Zealanders to enjoy learning about the Hispanic world," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Feature films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Mexico, Cuba, Ecuador and Spain and will screen until November 11.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The free screenings will be at the Davis Theatre in Watt St at 7pm on Thursdays and 4pm on Saturdays and there will be a fiesta celebration attended by Chilean ambassador Rodrigo Espinosaat the Sarjeant Gallery next Saturday, October 21.<br /></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The festival schedule and movie details can be picked up from the Sarjeant Gallery, Whanganui District Library, i-Site and from local cafes, or by going to lasffnz.co.nz.</strong></p>
