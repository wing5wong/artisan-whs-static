<p><span>Former WHS student Kieran O'Donnell was the top goalscorer for the Wanganui Lightning in the Lower North Island Inline Hockey League at the weekend.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Lightning claimed two wins and a draw from their four home games in the Lower North Island Inline Hockey League at Jubilee Stadium at the weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On currently calculations, this will leave the Lightning tied for second with the Tawa Typhoons after three rounds of the five round series, however the club's secretary/manager Rhiannon Vale said this is unconfirmed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The statistician has not received all the score sheets and done the proper count.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There were lots of forfeited games from other teams which has made the process of working out were we sit on the table event harder."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Lightning had to play without two of their three Ashworth brothers &ndash; Matt and Joel &ndash; who were injured.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They started on Saturday morning with a 4-4 draw against the Levin Rebels, who beat them in the opening game of last year's Whanganui tournament.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next up in the afternoon was the big one, as the Lightning had their best win with a 7-2 victory over rivals the Rimutaka Renegades.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">However, opportunity slipped a little on Sunday morning as they lost to Tawa 3-2, while picking up a victory in the fourth game by forfeit against the Capital Penguins.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Penguins, who have a mixed team of men and women, still played the match, however they needed a goalkeeper from another club to make up the numbers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kieran O'Donnell was again the Lightning's best scorer with six goals and two assists, while brother James O'Donnell picked up four goals and four assists.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The club held a fundraising BBQ throughout the two days and raised $253 to support themselves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui Toyota, Flooring Xtra Wanganui and Masterbuilt sponsored the sizzle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The fourth round of the series is tentatively scheduled to be held in Kilbirnie in Wellington, followed by the final round in Levin.</p>
