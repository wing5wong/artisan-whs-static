<p>Crazy costumes, bright lights and rocking tunes made the Whanganui Smokefreerockquest finals the place to be on Saturday night.</p>
<p><strong>Fourteen musical acts from Whanganui High School (WHS)</strong>, Rangitikei College and Ruapehu College competed at the Royal Wanganui Opera House.</p>
<p>The top two bands and the two best solo/duo winners from the night will now each submit a 15-minute video of their best material to compete for a place at the national finals in September.</p>
<p><strong>WHS four-piece girl band Straight Lace won the band section. They placed first, followed by another WHS band, Brimstone, which came second.</strong></p>
<p>Straight Lace vocalist, Sasha Matthews, said the win may have been down to their confidence on stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We had strong energy on stage. We were really put together and clean and we put in a lot of effort. We were nervous at the start but got really excited as we got into it," Sasha said.</p>
<p><strong>Seventeen-year-old Madison Eades from WHS took out the solo/duo with her "jazzy soul" sound. She said she decided to do something different on stage this year.</strong></p>
<p>"I was really nervous, as I was using a looping pedal and I have never performed with one before. I was relieved when I came off stage that it all went well and I didn't muck up.</p>
<p>"It was a huge adrenaline rush and I was literally shaking," Madison said.</p>
<p>Xavia Steedman-Willis from Ruapehu College placed second in the solo/duo category.</p>
