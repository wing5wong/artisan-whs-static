<p class="element element-paragraph">It's a better time than ever to be entering the workforce, Whanganui's recent graduates of Limited Service Volunteer training have been told.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Five have taken part in the programme recently and graduates were welcomed to the Whanganui District Council chamber on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">LSV is a six-week course held at Burnham Military Camp for young people registered with Work and Income.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The course aims to increase the number of young people getting jobs or training by giving them the skills and attitude needed to succeed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mayor Hamish McDouall said in industries such as construction there was huge demand for labour on the way.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are so many jobs out there in the next couple of years. It's your world," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McDouall said he was on the unemployment benefit for three months when he returned from overseas 16 years ago "so I know how dispiriting it is".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Part time worked turned into fulltime work and he got on a roll.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sixteen years later I'm wearing a ridiculous robe like this, so who knows?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Graduate Angel Skelton said it was challenging but she adjusted well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It made me grow in ways I didn't know I could," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Hopefully I get to study film and pursue my dreams and desires working in media and entertainment."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jahzia Puohotaua had dreams of his name up in lights as a world great boxer but would join "the Navy for now".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said the LSV course was "pretty hard out" with activities like push-ups 30 seconds after waking up at 5.30am.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was flat out all the time and we never had a chance to have a break.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was hard out but it was the ability to stick with it that I learned. I'm used to just not liking stuff and boosting - that's my forte."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Graduate Brie Karena-Koro missed the ceremony because she had already started work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Work and Income says 70 per cent of trainees move from the jobseeker benefit into either full-time work or trade training courses within two months of completing the course.</p>
