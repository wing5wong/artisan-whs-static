The ever-popular high tea event at the Whanganui Literary Festival promises to be just as delicious as ever, but with a difference this year. Amber Rose who has just published a cookbook, ‘Wild Delicious’, will talk about her approach to tasty, nutritious food and what it was like cooking for stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, while people enjoy a scrumptious variety of sweet and savoury food.

Whanganui caterer, Judy Young, will make around five recipes from Amber Rose’s three cookbooks with the addition of some of her own little savoury tarts and sandwiches.

“People will get a taste of lots of lovely things,” Judy says. “I thought her smoked fish pate from ‘Wild Delicious’ sounded lovely and a roasted beetroot and chocolate cake with chocolate icing made with avocados will make a lovely combination.”

Judy has been trying out Amber’s recipes and making them in miniature for the occasion. The strawberry and pistachio cake baked with spelt flour and garnished with a honey rose cream is delectable and not too sweet.

“Amber has added some extra nutrition to sweet treats. The book has some excellent recipes and the ingredients are accessible. Some are more unusual. There are recipes I am really keen to try such as the Persian salad and the celeriac and beetroot remoulade. Celeriac is neat but you don’t see it a great deal. That is her twist on a classic French dish. She has travelled a lot and put her twist on dishes she has come across.”

Judy said she loved catering for the Jo Seagar high tea and talking with Jo at the Whanganui Literary Festival 2017.

“This one for Amber Rose is encouraging me to try different approaches too. Amber talks a lot about growing your own food and foraging and that is how she was brought up by her mother, Kay Miller of Koanga Gardens – so she uses fresh ingredients, perhaps with a modern twist, such as using raw cacao, raw cocoa nibs, raw honey and using vegetables in cakes.”

The high tea food will be free from refined sugar. Gluten free and vegetarian needs have been considered.

Numbers are limited. Wildly Delicious with Amber Rose – Sunday, 6 October, 3pm to 4pm at the Memorial Centre. Bookings at the Royal Wanganui Opera House.
