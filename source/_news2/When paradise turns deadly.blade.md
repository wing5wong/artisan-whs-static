<h4 class="element element-paragraph">The daring rescue of stranded swimmers from a Kai Iwi Beach cove in powerful king tide waves has won Wanganui Surf Lifeguard Service the rescue of the year awards from surf life saving's national body.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Two IRBs and swimmers were used to successfully extract a father and daughter from the cove over three hours on the afternoon of February 18 while the dramatic operation was coordinated from the club's new watch tower.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It means a massive amount to the club," lifeguard <strong>Matthew Newell</strong> said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was one of nine lifeguards along with<strong> James Newell</strong>, Phil Gilmore, <strong>Laura O'Keeffe, Clarissa Nowak, Sophie Couper,</strong> Laurie Gil, <strong>Alex Forlong and Kaya Dobbie were involved in the rescue and received the gong at the Surf Life Saving New Zealand's Awards of Excellence on Saturday.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The rescue began when police called Wanganui SLS chairman James Newell with reports of two swimmers missing off Kai Iwi Beach just after 12pm on the day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The sea was too rough for Coastguard to get out and with half an hour O'Keeffe and Forlong were out on the water in an IRB.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The king tide was 30 minutes from peaking and 2m storm waves were smashing along the cliffs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Dobbie and Matthew Newell were set up in the newly built watch tower, along with Police and Coastguard, communicating with the rescuers on the water.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The man and his daughter had sought refuge in a small cove trying to get out from the smashing waves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Matthew Newell said it was the way the lifeguards worked with other agencies which was a key factor in the win.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They respected our knowledge and expertise around the surf and respected the way we wanted to execute the operation," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was pretty horrible weather, it was pretty horrible surf. The girl had an injured foot and was becoming hypothermic."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But to pull it ofs perfectly showed the capability of the Whanganui crew, Newell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have an awesome bunch of lifeguards coming through showing lots of potential and all our guards are trained to a high standard."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Experienced IRB driver O'Keeffe dropped Forlong into the water to collect the patients but the surf was too powerful and she injured her hand against the rock before swimming back to the IRB.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was decided the cliff was too unstable for the rescue helicopter to winch the patients or for the fire service to abseil and lifeguards had decided to dispatch a second IRB from Castlecliff with Gilmore.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">James Newell decided the safest option was to extract the pair using the two IRBs and swimmers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The lifeguards had short intervals of between 30 seconds and two minutes between shore dumps to take an IRB into the cliffs and hide in the sets behind a slip which had formed a small island about 50m down from the patients.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After waiting for the next flat period, Nowak swam to rescue the young girl and take her back to the IRB, waiting for yet another calm patch before returning to shore.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The same procedure was used to rescue the girl's father, who was unharmed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The whole operation used nine lifeguards, two IRBs, an ambulance, eight police officers, two fire engines and a helicopter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">SLSNZ said all of the lifeguards involved performed extremely well using good radio communication from the watch tower base.</p>
