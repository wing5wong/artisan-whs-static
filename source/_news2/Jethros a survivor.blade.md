<p>The Cancer Society's Survivors' Lap on Saturday was an emotional one for Whanganui's Chiet family.</p>
<p>Jethro Chiet, now aged two, was diagnosed with leukaemia in January 2016. This time last year he was at Starship Hospital for seven months' treatment - which finished in August.</p>
<p>"We set the goal of walking in the Survivors' Lap this time last year, when he was really sick," his mum Jo Chiet said.</p>
<p>Her husband Phil was given two terms away from his work at Whanganui High School, which Mrs Chiet said made a massive difference.</p>
<p>The family was able to stay at Ronald McDonald House in Auckland while Jethro got all kinds of treatment at Starship Hospital. Big brother Micah liked being there and having both parents around so much that he's still asking to go back.</p>
<p>Jethro is now in remission, and having monthly checks. The Chiets joined about 50 others to walk a celebratory Survivors' Lap with him on Saturday.</p>
<p>It was part of this year's Relay for Life, the Cancer Society's biggest fundraiser. It went from 11am to 11pm on Saturday.</p>
<p>In it teams and individuals fundraise and also walk circuits of the athletics track at Cooks Gardens. Some teams get sponsorship for the laps they do.</p>
<p>About 400 people walked the track, which Cancer Society fundraising co-ordinator Annette Cox said was good, given there were a lot of other things on.</p>
<p>"We were just very proud of how many people came in from our community and helped us out this year."</p>
<p>The society needs "thousands" to support local people who have cancer. She won't know how much was raised this year until bills are paid and remaining sponsorship money comes in.</p>
<p>Her aim was to make the 12-hour event a family fun day, with the YMCA and others providing games and activities for children. Live music was broadcast from a stage, and More FM's Tyler McDonald was the MC.</p>
<p>Dozens of volunteers pitched in to make it all happen, and businesses and individuals donated products and time.</p>
<p>Survivors were treated to a lunch after their lap, and the candlelit Ceremony of Memories at 9.30pm had to move into the stand because rain was collapsing the candle bags. In those solemn moments a piper played on a hill, karakia were said and four glowing lanterns were set free to drift off into low cloud. The effect was eerie, Mrs Cox said.</p>
<p>She has yet to assess whether it's better to run the Relay for Life over 12 hours or the usual 24.</p>
<p>There were 29 teams this year, about half the number when Relay for Life, a United States franchise, was first brought to Whanganui. In recent years it's been harder to get teams to commit to staying and walking all night.</p>
<p>Mrs Cox said the day was fantastic, but at 11pm when it was raining she was glad to go home to her own bed.</p>
<p>Asked how the fundraiser will run next year, she said "Watch this space".</p>
