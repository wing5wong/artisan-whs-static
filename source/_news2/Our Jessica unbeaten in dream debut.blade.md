<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui's</strong> <strong>Jessica Watkin</strong> has hit the ground running in her White Ferns debut as she and captain Suzie Bates led the team to a commanding 10 wicket win over Ireland in the Twenty20 opening game of their United Kingdom tour overnight yesterday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Watkin</strong> and Bates shared in an unbeaten 142-run opening partnership off just 68 balls at the YMCA Cricket Club in Dublin &ndash; an all-wicket record for the White Ferns in T20 and the fifth highest in all women's T20 internationals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Watkin finished with 77 not out off 38 balls, striking 11 boundaries and three sixers</strong>, with Bates likewise unbeaten with 63 not out from 29 balls.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It went pretty well, bit of a batter's dream out there, really," Watkin said as she and fellow debutant Bernadine Bezuidenhout took turns interviewing each other in a video posted to the White Ferns Facebook page.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was pretty cool to bat with Suzie, that's always been something that I've looked forward too.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Pretty nervous to face that first ball, and then once I hit that I was set in. It was good batting out there."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Watkin reached her first 50 for New Zealand off 26 balls, having hit eight boundaries and two sixers.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She had been so zoned-in for the hunt to reach the Irish score of 136-8 that the personal milestone came as a surprise.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It kinda snuck up on me pretty quick, so I didn't really know, and then Suzie gave me a handshake and I was like, 'oh, I better raise my bat now then'."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wicketkeeper Bezuidenhout had a fine debut herself, getting five dismissals with the gloves &ndash; three catches and two stumpings &ndash; after Ireland won the toss and put themselves into bat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The success will greatly improve Watkin's chances of establishing herself in the regular White Ferns playing XI as the tour moves onto three 50-over internationals with Ireland, followed by the T20 tri-series with South Africa and England, then three ODIs with England, the world champions of the format.</p>
