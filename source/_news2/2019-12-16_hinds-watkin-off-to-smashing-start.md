The Central Hinds and their **Whanganui co-captain Jessica Watkin** got their Dream11 Super Smash campaign off to a winning start with a 19-run win over the Canterbury Magicians at Lincoln today.

Batting first, the Hinds raised 137-7 from their 20 overs, with Watkin scoring 17 from 12 balls at the top of the order

Opening partner Emily Cunningham went on to make 36 from 33 balls, while wicketkeeper Natalie Dodd came in at No 3 and top scored with 43 from 42, as they all anchored the run chase, with the middle order including Wanganui representative Kerry Tomlinson dismissed in single figures.

In reply, Canterbury were restricted to 118-9 at the end of their innings.

Watkin opened the bowling with her spin and picked up a wicket in the first over, finishing with a conservative 1-15 from her maximum four overs.

Rosemary Mair was even harder to get away, with 2-6 including one maiden from her four overs, while Watkin's fellow co-captain Hannah Rowe took 3-27.

The Hinds will now play the Northern Spirit at Bert Sutcliffe Oval tomorow morning.
