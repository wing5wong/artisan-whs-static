<p class="element element-paragraph">The countdown is on for the 24-Hour Art Jam beginning at Space Gallery from 10am on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Graham Hall will be there with his 1840s Seggy print-making press and a selection of plates.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's going to be fun - I haven't used it much myself yet and I'm looking forward to giving it a good run."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Art Jam organiser and Space owner Sarah Williams says Whanganui's newest art experience should be a blast and there should be something for everyone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The printing workshop is one of several that will be running from 10am on Saturday until 10am on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will be a mixture of live music and guest playlists playing throughout the event with activities split between the gallery downstairs and the upstairs studios.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Street artist Dan Mills is providing a blank canvas for everyone to paint and collage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He will then transform it and it will be sold at the post-event charity auction along with other works produced during the 24 hours," says Williams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui District Library staff will run a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;themed craft project and artist Brownyn Hughes will present her&nbsp;<em>Osadia of Barcelona</em>&nbsp;inspired steampunk fantasy and makeup workshop transforming willing participants of all ages into living works of art.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And&nbsp;<em>Lovelifelive</em>&nbsp;face painting hire will offer free face painting for children.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Sunday night there will be a charity auction of works completed during the 24-Hour Art Jam with proceeds going to support Women's Network Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>24-Hour Art Jam: Space Studio &amp; Gallery, 64 Taupo Quay. From 10am Saturday, October 13 to 10am Sunday, October 14. Doors open for charity auction at 5.30pm on Sunday. See more at&nbsp;<a href="https://spacestudiogallery.co.nz/coming-soon/24-hour-art-jam/" target="_blank">Space Jam</a></strong></p>
