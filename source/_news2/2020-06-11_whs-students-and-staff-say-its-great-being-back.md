The co-operation and support of Whanganui High School students, staff and whānau was greatly appreciated as we all wrestled with learning and teaching effectively in the remote world during the recent lockdown period. Important LIFE-long lessons were learnt by students and staff together.

During lockdown, two students were able to compete in a virtual forum with success. Hazel Chant and Harriet Buchan were winners of the Earth Guardians junior concept design competition run by CoCA Massey. Hazel won the Go Digital challenge with ‘Sanctuary’. Her inspirations for this character were sandstone cliffs that birds nest in with clinging pohutukawa trees. Harriet won the Go Costume challenge with ‘Hali the Deep Ocean Guardian’. Her inspiration for this character was an angler fish with sirens, Greek attire and a ‘Day at the beach’ theme.

Aidan Moon recently returned from an overseas exchange with his family. Living in Edmonton, Canada, proved to be an interesting educational experience with Aidan attending one of the most prestigious schools in Canada. Aidan also travelled to many other places during the one year exchange programme. Destinations included Cancun, Mexico, Ecuador, as well as several American states to learn about plenty of different ecologies, above water and under water. The plethora of opportunities provided by the exchange will assist Aidan with swift reintegration back into school life at Whanganui High School

We look forward to embracing an ever-increasing sense of normality over the coming weeks and months. I am always happy to meet with parents of our current students – or parents of students intending to enrol with us for 2021 – to discuss any aspect of education and life at Whanganui High School. Please ring the main office on 06-349-0178 to make an appointment to see me.
