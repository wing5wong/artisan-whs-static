<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Former WHS student Tim Easton, Whanganui Labour Party Chair and Spokesperson.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Sunday, November 4 saw an historic victory for the Whanganui Labour party, when Whanganui City was declared the host of the 2019 Labour Party Conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The vote, which took all of two minutes, was the end point of a campaign that began three months earlier with an email from head office looking for bids.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">That email sparked the interest of the Whanganui Labour Party Chair, Tim Easton and local Mayor, Hamish McDouall and together a plan was hatched to bring the 800 plus delegates, Prime Minister and national media here to our city &ndash; an event that would see more than an estimated $500,000 in economic benefits to the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">With broad support from neighbouring electorate teams, Whanganui and Partners and the Mayor, a comprehensive bid was submitted to the Labour Head Office in Wellington.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #1d2129; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">In October the team received word that the bid had been accepted, but it would be contested. Whanganui would need to prepare a pitch to the Dunedin conference and outperform Rotorua, in winning over the support from Labour Party members across the country. This would be no easy feat. Whanganui was up against an international tourist town, represented in Parliament by Rotorua MP, Tamati Coffey and a history of hosting previous conferences.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">Meetings were held, ideas brainstormed and presentations debated. Out of this emerged a plan. The plan would see Easton, McDouall and Te Tai Hauauru MP, Adrian Ruawahe, present the case with support from delegates, to conference 2018.</p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">Rotorua, with a history of winning conference bids, put on a star-studded performance led by ex-entertainer Tamati Coffey MP. Their pitch ran to 17 minutes and it was a clear feeling that Whanganui would have to seriously up the stakes if they were to have a chance to win. This truly was a moment to take a deep breath, step forward and hold nothing back.</p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened. Rurawhe started with a touching mihi dedicated to the people, the city and the awa, followed closely by a rousing yet poignant speech from McDouall. It struck a fine balance between not only why Whanganui should be first choice - our culture, our people and our renowned manaakitanga, but also why Whanganui needs to be the first choice &ndash; the Labour Party&rsquo;s and local party members&rsquo; commitment to the regions to ensure the representation of all New Zealanders.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">Easton then front footed potential questions from delegates, who may not have realised just how well connected Whanganui is, just how many caf&eacute;s or the quality of accommodation Whanganui offers.</p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">After several rounds of voting, 70% of hands reached for the conference ceiling. Whanganui had triumphed and was declared the hosts of Conference 2019.</p>
<p style="margin: 6px 0px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #1d2129;">This conference is so much more than the 800+ delegates and $500,000 economic boom to the city. The conference shows a Labour Party that is committed to the regions, is backing cities like Whanganui and is ready to turn blue seats red in 2020.</p>
