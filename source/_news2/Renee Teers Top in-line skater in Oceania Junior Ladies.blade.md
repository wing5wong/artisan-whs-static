<h3>Renee Teers named top in-line skater in Oceania competition for Junior Ladies.</h3>
<p>Renee Teers fell in love with in-line skating when she was only nine years old watching the River City Tour competition held every year in Whanganui. Now aged 16 she has been named the top competitor in the Junior Ladies division at the Oceania In-Line skating competitions held in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>It would have been hard for anyone else to compete for the title as Renee won golds in the 10km elimination a</strong><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>nd marathon races and silvers in the time trial 200 metres, one lap sprint and in the 1000 metres.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">There were four skaters from Whanganui competing at the Oceania Games. The others were <strong>Chase Morepeth</strong>, Drew Brennan and Joshua Vallentine.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Renee&rsquo;s next international competition will be at the worlds which her mother, Suz Ballard, told the RCP &ldquo;Will be held in Spain in July. &ldquo; Suz will accompany Renee to those competitions.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Suz says that &ldquo;Renee was also part of a small New Zealand team competing at the Asian Games in South Korea last year, where she reached the finals of the 1000 metres &ndash; which was huge.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Nationals are held every year either in Timaru or in Hamilton. They include racing on a flat track and on the road &ndash; held at Christmas time &ndash; and on a banked track, held in February.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Renee recently received a grant from the Future Champions Trust for which Renee and her family were grateful. Otherwise it is up to the competitors to meet all their own costs.</span></p>
