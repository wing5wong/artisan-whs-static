<p class="element element-paragraph">Springvale Cafe's baristas are used to being busy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But when their cafe decides to give away free coffees for a week, that's a whole new level.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had somebody comment on Facebook that our baristas must be ninjas, which is really nice, so we're calling them our ninja baristas now," Springvale Cafe owner Lyn Crawford said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The cafe at Springvale Garden Centre been running its annual Coffee for a Can where for five days the cafe gave away a free coffee to anyone who brought in a can of food, with the cans being donated to Women's Refuge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's the third year the cafe has run the collection and owner Lyn Crawford said while she hadn't counted the cans yet, it would well exceed last year's 420.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been beyond our expectations, it's just been crazy," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People think it's amazing and we think it's amazing. We're just blown away by how many cans come in."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Crawford said people were really supportive of campaigns that were about giving.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To us it's about giving back to the community, it's something we can do.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People of Whanganui get on board, our staff get on board with it and get excited about it.</p>
<p><span><span>"There's a huge amount of support out there for the Women's Refuge. A lot if people bring in more than one can some bring in money as well."</span></span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Crawford said the Coffee for Cans collection made for an "extremely busy week" at the cafe.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The baristas have worked really hard because you can imagine how many coffees on top of what we normally do," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The baristas have worked hard, the whole team have worked hard."</p>
