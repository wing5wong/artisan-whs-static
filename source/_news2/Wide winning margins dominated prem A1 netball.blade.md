<p class="element element-paragraph">All three Whanganui Premier 1 netball clashes were won by wide margins again as teams find their feet in the 2018 season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Monday night match-ups were the first since opening night on May 30 and obviously some found it challenging coming into game two of the season a fortnight later.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Defending champions Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau convincingly beat Mere Te Aroha 6-35, while Phillips Electrical Whanganui High School bounced back from a season opening loss to beat Cullinane 68-37. In the other Premier 1 clash Kaiwhaiki continued their winning ways dispatching Marist A1 65-38.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kaierau coach Walter Edmonds said early season fitness played a pivotal role in the victory over MTA.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Even though it was a wide winning margin we play okay and still have lots to work on," Edmonds said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"One of the biggest contributing factors in our win was our fitness. We had a big lead in to the season and we were fit. Coming into matches fit is a big thing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Edmonds singled out wing attack Karaihi Peina for special praise.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Karaihi played a huge role on court with her work rate and availability to get free," Edmonds said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS had a shaky start against Cullinane emerging from the first quarter four points ahead.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was quite close during that first quarter, but once we got into the game and warmed up we managed to draw away," coach Lisa Murphy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Seven of my 10-strong squad are rep players and some also play basketball, so have been busy in the lead up to Monday night. Most of my girls are U17 reps with one, goal keep Kara Adrole an U15 rep and they have just returned from tournaments, so there were a few tired legs out their on Monday."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Murphy singled out her defensive players, goal defence Kristin Thompson and Adrole for special mention.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They both had very consistent games."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, last season's runners-up Kaiwhaiki made it two from two when leaving Marist A1 in it wake after starting with a flurry to claim the first quarter 17-10. Kaiwhaiki were clinical leading throughout to win comfortably by 27 points.</p>
