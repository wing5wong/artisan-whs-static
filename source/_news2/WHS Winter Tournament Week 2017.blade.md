<p>Whanganui High School had 10 teams competing in the Winter Tournament Week all over New Zealand.</p>
<p>Our Boys Hockey 1<sup>st</sup> XI were in Hamilton at the Rankin Cup Division 1 Competition. Unfortunately, the boys did not qualify to stay in the Division for next year, but had some tight games against some very strong opposition. They finished the tournament with wins on the last day.</p>
<p>Our Girls 1<sup>st</sup> XI Hockey were in Palmerston Nth and had a very strong tournament making the final. They could not complete their winning streak and placed 2<sup>nd</sup> overall.</p>
<p>The Boys 1<sup>st</sup> XI Football team were also in Palmerston Nth. The playing conditions were not the best with field changes daily because of heavy rain overnight. The boys finished 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Our Phillips Electrical A1 Netball Team went to New Plymouth to the Lower North Island Secondary School Tournament and had a very good week away. Winning 6 out of their 9 games they placed 10<sup>th</sup> overall out of 32 teams in A Grade.</p>
<p>Our Girls 1<sup>st</sup> XI Football team was in Wellington with horrible weather conditions the whole week. The girls had some great games and competed to a high standard placing 10<sup>th</sup>. This is the highest our team has come at the tournament.</p>
<p>The U15 Rugby team were in Wellington also at the U15 Hurricanes tournament against some very prestigious rugby schools. Our boys learnt a lot from the tournament and managed a win on the last day against Mana College to finish 15<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>The Junior Boys Basketball team played in New Plymouth at the start of the week in their tournament. The team of 8 players worked tirelessly every game and sunk some great shots throughout the tournament. They finished 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Our 1<sup>st</sup> XV hosted the &lsquo;Central 6 &ndash; Mark Ranby Trophy&rsquo; at school, where there was some great rugby played over the 3 days. Our boys made the final against Tawa, but could not stop the Tawa boys from winning the tournament finishing runners-up. We are looking to host this again next year.</p>
<p>Our Boys Badminton team went to Napier where they struggled for the first few days, but came right towards the end of the week.</p>
<p>For the first time, we have had two boys qualify in the NZSS Pool 8 Ball tournament which was in Christchurch this year. The boys enjoyed their experience and learnt a lot from the tournament against some classy Pool players.</p>
<p>Whanganui High School would like to thank all our staff, parent coaches, managers and supporters that have helped get our students to these tournaments. As a school, we wouldn&rsquo;t of been able to get the students there without your support.&nbsp;</p>
