<p class="element element-paragraph">After 20 years away from Whanganui playing music professionally, Daniel Waho has returned to his hometown with plans to give back.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The singer and saxophonist is part of newly-formed Whanganui band Reset which is playing two gigs later this month as a fundraiser.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Proceeds will go to getting them to the Queenstown Jazzfest which they are on the lineup for.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We play everything. Jazz, contemporary music, top 40," Waho said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've got a lot of gigs coming up throughout the summer."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Waho has formed Reset with Matt Mareikura, Charlie Peina, Maynard Mason and <strong>Fred Loveridge</strong> and said it had all come together quickly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's a wealth of knowledge within the five of us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But beyond this summer Waho is planning to run a jazz and blues festival in Whanganui next November.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think Whanganui deserves to have an event like that," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's just about organisation and patience and the want to do it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ratana-born Waho has made a living playing music since he left town, based firstly out of Whangarei and then the Gold Coast for the past 15 years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has toured with Ardijah and House of Shem and shared a stage with James Brown in Auckland in 1996.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Music can take you places if you want it. I'm grateful to have had that opportunity."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now back home, Waho also wants to help mentor young Whanganui musicians.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's always one in a million that's going to stand out from the rest. They just need direction and the right resources," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was bought up on music since I was a kid playing in the big band at Ratana but I think understanding what I wanted to do with it was the hardest part."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>*<em>Reset play the Savage Club Hall on September 29 with The Replicants from 7pm. $20 on the door. On September 30 they play at Frank Bar from 8pm for a $10 door charge.</em></strong></p>
