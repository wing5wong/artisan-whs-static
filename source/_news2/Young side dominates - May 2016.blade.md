<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">THE Wanganui Under-18 girls hockey team had a good trip to Napier with wins over Wairarapa and Hawke's Bay on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>Coach Jan Dixon said the team will not be able to attend the week-long national tournament in Timaru this year, so it was pleasing to have success in the mini tournament.</p>
<p>"The first game was against Wairarapa. For a team put together two weeks ago and only having one training the girls played a really nice passing game and scored first through Grace Godfrey."</p>
<p>Wairarapa tied the match up before the halftime break, but Wanganui came back firing and scored twice more through Sophie Redmayne and the second goal to Godfrey for 3-1.</p>
<p>The team then had a 150-minute rest until facing Hawke's Bay, who had the bye in the morning after playing on Saturday evening against Wellington, winning 5-1.</p>
<p>"We knew it would be a hard game. The girls came out hard and fast and put Hawke's Bay under pressure," said Dixon.</p>
<p>The matchup went from end to end before <strong>Rebecca Baker</strong> slotted a nice field goal.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we let Hawke's Bay come back not long after," said Dixon.</p>
<p>"Credit to our great defence - we held out any further attacks and got some quick breakaways, one ending in our second goal by Sophie Redmayne."</p>
<p>After the 2-1 win, Dixon said the squad had played like a team that had been together for a long time.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>"Both Elaine Baker [manager] and myself are very proud of the girls and thank them all for coming together to show other associations in Central that Wanganui age group hockey is a force to be feared."</p>
<p>Standout players were Godfrey, Lily Kelt and Kate Tylee (Collegiate), along with Wanganui High School's <strong>Baker and Jess Watkin</strong>, and the side's Manawatu import Chloe Wright-Steer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the combined Whanganui team swept up into second spot on the Manawatu Division 2 women's ladder after hammering PN Marist 10-0 at the Gonville turf on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>With five wins and two losses, the team have now scored 49 goals in the division, the most of any team in the grade. Whanganui were leading 4-0 at halftime in the wet conditions and went on with it in the second stanza, although coach Colleen Baylis knew it wasn't a perfect performance.</p>
<p>"I counted at least 10 missed opportunities in the first half," she said.</p>
<p>"Just those little deflections. We made their goalie look good, we gave her a workout.</p>
<p>"There's still things to work on."</p>
<p>Nicky Skedgwell had missed out on scoring in previous games but got to make up for it with four goals.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Baker</strong> played well on what would be a big weekend for her with success in the Wanganui Under-18 team.</p>
<p>The big win meant Whanganui went ahead of HSHC B on goal differential, as well as HSHC Evergreens who lost 3-1 to the undefeated College Development.</p>
<p>"The formula was we need to win and needed College Development to win as well," said Baylis.</p>
<p>Still, the logic will be to try to hang on to second spot come the semifinals to avoid meeting College Development until the last game, as they will take some stopping with 48 goals scored and only ten conceded in seven victories so far.</p>
<p>In the Men's Division One competition, it was not a good day in the later afternoon game at Gonville with Tech College Old Boys losing 3-1 to PN Marist, who moved up to third on the table.</p>
<p>TCOB, with one win and a draw from their six games, are still in touching distance of College (2-1-3) in fourth spot, but will have work to do to get there.</p>
<p>Manawatu League hockey takes a break this weekend with Central Hockey representative games being held, and then returns on June 11.</p>
