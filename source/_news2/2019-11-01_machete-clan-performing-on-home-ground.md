Machete Clan, Drxnes and Mungbeanz (mixing for Machete Clan) had the packed crowd rocking at Frank last weekend.

The former WHS lads were playing the last gig of their 2 month NZ ‚ÄòHomeless Monsters‚Äô Tour on home soil and the crowd were loving every minute of it!

Awesome guys, Wangaz enjoyed having you!

Come again soon.  üëç
