<p><strong>A host of current and ex-pat Whanganui rugby schoolboys have been chosen for the Hurricanes Under 18 coaching camp in Masterton next month.</strong></p>
<p>Sixty players from around the Hurricanes catchment will take part in the four-day camp with a range of coaches, including the Hurricanes Super Rugby coaching staff of Chris Boyd and John Plumtree.</p>
<p><strong>From the Whanganui High School First XV comes Griffin Culver, Dylan Bowater and Adam Boult</strong> of Cullinane College - who plays for WHS in the McDonald's Manawatu Colts competition in a special agreement between the schools.</p>
<p>Also taking part will be Collegiate's Harry Unsworth, a previous Hurricanes camp attendee.</p>
<p>Joining them will be two ex-pats attending the dominant Feilding Ag High School - Jack Kinder and Vilimoni Koroi.</p>
<p>WHS's three player contribution from outside a major centre is impressive considering the most heavily represented school was Hastings Boys High School with 10 players, followed by Gisborne BHS (9), Palmerston North Boys (5) and Rongotai College (4).</p>
<p>WHS First XV will be missing those players for that weekend as they compete in the Top 6 grade of the Manawatu Colts competition, as will St Johns Club Wanganui Metro Colts.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
