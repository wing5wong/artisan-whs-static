<p>JUNIOR ACTION: Whanganui Junior Motocross Academy riders Ajah Sullivan (left), Jaxon Cooper, Campbell Tylee, Riki Wainhouse (WHS student), Tyler Edwards, Logan Smith <span>(WHS student)</span>, Troy England, Alex Luff-Scott <span>(WHS student)</span>, Matt Barron, Jet Ashworth, Troy Bullock and Leighton Mallinder, flanked but nationally ranked No 3 Cody Cooper (left) and No 1 Rhys Carter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The roles will be reversed when the Balance Chartered Accountants Whanganui Junior Motorcross Academy coaches head stateside next month.</p>
<p>The coaches, Rhys Carter and Cody Cooper, are normally barracking for the youngsters they have trained over the past two years when they go to war on regional and national stages.</p>
<p>But next month the youngsters will be backing their mentors as they tackle the first two rounds of the American National Motorcross Championships in California.</p>
<p>The 2017 Lucas Oil Pro Motocross Championship is a 12-round series, but Carter and Cooper are only competing in the first two beginning with the Hangtown Motorcross Classic in Sacramento on May 20 followed by the Glen Helen National on May 27 in San Bernardino.</p>
<p>The pair are in solid form for their tough upcoming assignment with Carter ranked the No1 rider in New Zealand and Cooper No3, split only by Australian Dean Kerris at the New Zealand Championships.</p>
<p>Cooper has some experience at the ultimate level in the United States when finishing 19th in round one last year. That is some achievement with many being eliminated during qualifying let alone finishing in a top 20 spot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mentors are ready to start their two day training camp with up-and-coming local junior riders who have been picked for the academy to improve there riding skills.</p>
