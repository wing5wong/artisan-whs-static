<p>WELL-EARNED: Co-coaches Luke Watts (left) and Ian Weenink applaud the gold-winning performance of Wanganui High School rowers Matthew Wright and Nathan Luff in Twizel at the weekend.</p>
<p>The pair claimed the Aon Maadi Cup boys' under-18 lightweight doubles title to go with their North Island gold earlier in the season.</p>
<p>WHS sport co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said the achievement was the pinnacle for the team competing at the national secondary schools regatta on Lake Ruataniwha and just reward for the long hours of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>WHS also returned home with bronze claimed by Luff in the boys under-18 single sculls.</p>
