During the last week of Term 3 our Junior Debaters were all geared up for their last confrontation of the Regional Junior Debating John Prestage Competition.  Preparation had been thorough and presentations were practiced and perfected until the last minute.  

Our Whero and Kowhai team had to negate the moot: “This House will ban the use of plastic packaging”. 

Our Kakariki team would be the affirmative side in their debate. Unfortunately for them, their opponents had to cancel and so we won by default, which is always a bit unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, congratulations go out to Hazel Chant, Ela Robbins and Charlotte Hardy. All three of them will continue next year and will be able to lead the new year 9 debaters to success.

**WHS Whero team went to Palmerston North Girls’ High School and came back with a solid win.** Negating the moot was not easy, because the general emotion around the issue of plastic packaging is that it is harmful for the environment. Our team acknowledged that, but then went on to state that plastic is a wonderful product with many advantages that cannot be replaced by other products, yet. They convincingly argued that it is the way we, people, discard of plastic that is the problem. **Congratulations, Olivia Bedwell, Ashlea Hale and Dominic Benfell.**

WHS Kowhai team also went to Palmerston North, but their debate was against ‘Boys’ High’. This was a nail-biter that eventually was ruled in the favour of the hosts. Our team was, however praised by the adjudicator for their strong presentation of their counter arguments and their ability to respond to the affirmative side’s interpretation of the moot. Well done Toni Adams, Calum Sinclair and Firooze Colaabavala. 

Coincidentally, our Kowhai team was in Palmerston North at the same time as the large climate change march, attended by numerous young people, including school students. It is heart-warming to see young people caring for, and debating about, the future of our planet.
