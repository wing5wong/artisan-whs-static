<p><strong>Whanganui High School student recipients; L&gt;R - Lucas Thompson, James Rountree, Jack Clifton, Liam Lace, Sophie Brooke and Rebecca Benge (front right).</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They are spreading their wings to Adelaide, Bulgaria, and Belgium in the coming months and eight young Whanganui athletes have received a helping hand as the latest recipients of the Mitre 10 Mega Futures Champions Trust funding grant.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The grants, given out biannually in two funding rounds, which close in March and September, have previously totalled around $1000-1500 for each recipient.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This latest round has a larger group, with eight recipients sharing a split of just over $7000 for their various international events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were acknowledged at a ceremony yesterday afternoon at Columbus Caf&eacute;.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's double Olympic medallist Rebecca Scown was able to attend in her role as the Future Champions Trust Ambassador.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The current group include canoeists Jack Clifton, Lucas Thompson, Liam Lace, and Sophie Brooke, who have just represented New Zealand at the Asia Pacific Regatta in Adelaide.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Clifton and Lace will be going on to the ICF Canoe Sprint Junior World Championships, being held in Bulgaria in July.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Also on the water, rower Nathan Luff has been selected for the New Zealand Under 21 squad who will travel to meet Australia in a series next month.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>From the world of equestrian, Rebecca Benge will be representing New Zealand at the World Championships in Belgium this August.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Motocross standout James Rountree is attending the Australian Championships in October</strong>, while speedskater Drew Brennan was at the Oceania championships, held in Timaru in April.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are very grateful to our naming rsponsors...and a number of other Whanganui businesses and individuals who continue to commit to supporting these hard working and talented young people, said trust chairwoman Philippa Baker-Hogan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These young people are some of our best role models to other youth in their schools and communities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"However the cost of these trips are high and we try and take the pressure off these young people and their families, to help them to concentrate on performing well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Sponsorship comes from Mitre 10, H&amp;A Print, Display Associates, Inferno Design, Sport Whanganui, Central City Pharmacy, Wanganui Lions Club, Doyle &amp; Associates Ltd, Hogan Osteo Plus, Kelly Associates, Richard Millward &amp; Associates, Markham &amp; Partners.</p>
