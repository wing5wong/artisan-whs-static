<p><span>In 2014, Adrian Campbell weighed just under 200 kilograms. Five years later, he weighs 99.6. <br /><em>Photo / Supplied</em></span></p>
<p><br />When he was 25 years old, Adrian Campbell weighed almost 200 kilograms.</p>
<p>His 199.6kg frame didn't stand out to him as much as it did to others.</p>
<p>Campbell referred to himself as a capable fatty who could exercise and who felt fine most of the time.</p>
<p>At that time in July 2014, Campbell was willing to admit the size of his belly affected his ability to do things, but he was about to get a reality check.</p>
<p>It came from his friend, Jo Giddens.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">"We sat down in her back yard and she just laid it out on the table.</span>&nbsp;<span>She was concerned about how big I'd gotten, especially over that year," Campbell says.</span></p>
<p>"It was almost like having the wind knocked out of me. I sat and listened. I was there for a while, we had little discussions and a bit of a tangi, a bit of a cry.</p>
<p>"After I left, I got mad. I got mad at her, I got mad at myself, I got mad at the situation. I didn't know what to do or how to figure this out."</p>
<p>Campbell was born in Whanganui, but moved to Morrinsville for a time, which is when he became less active.</p>
<p>He returned to the River City aged 15, attended <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> and then the Whanganui School of Design, which is when he "really started packing it on".<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />After what Giddens said to him, Campbell went away and thought about what it was that wasn't doing his size any favours.</p>
<p>The obvious answer was his diet, but more specifically sugar, so he went sugar free and began reading "I Quit Sugar" by Sarah Wilson.</p>
<p>In year one of his weight-loss journey, Campbell shed 15kg without exercising and a year later he joined Inspire Health and Fitness Centre on Wilson St.</p>
<p>"I went there because my friend Selina Kaipo worked there and she's someone that had known me for a long time.</p>
<p>"It was good to know I wasn't laying my soul bare to a stranger."</p>
<p>From there, Campbell continued to increase his training, this time with bodybuilder Kirsty Harvey, who helped him lose 30 more kilograms in his third year.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Campbell has been training at Awa Kings Muay Thai on Guyton St.</p>
<p>He has known operators Kat Hiroti and Lee Ashford for about 10 years and said they are like family to him now.</p>
<p>"Awa Kings was another safe place for me. I knew I wasn't going to get heckled there like I had in public," Campbell said.</p>
<p>"Going there was a good step and I built up a lot of confidence. It's a family environment, you're not there to be judged, people are just there to help."</p>
<p>Five years after he bought a book, writing down his goals and his feelings, Campbell has achieved his main objective.</p>
<p>He has lost 100kg and is doing things he never thought he would do in his life, including getting in the ring for two fights.</p>
<p>Campbell is also instructing others and having people approach him for advice, which he is more than willing to share.</p>
<p>He wanted to thank all of the people that helped him along the way, so he is hosting a fundraiser at Awa Kings as a way of giving back.</p>
<p>There will be raffles, a bake sale and Campbell will be sparring 100 rounds with other club members or anyone else who wants to give it a go, all they need is a mouthguard.</p>
<p>Participants will pay a set price or a koha and the money raised will go towards new equipment for Awa Kings because Campbell says what they have gets "thrashed".</p>
<p>Campbell will also be losing a little more weight in the big bushy beard he has been growing since his journey began.</p>
<p>It will be sectioned off and, for a koha, people can shave a portion of it off themselves.</p>
<p>The second part of Campbell's fundraising will go towards the Ngā Tai o te Awa Pink Ribbon Breakfast because that is where he works as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, Campbell will look at keeping what is left over for himself.</p>
<p>"Kat said we also have to make it about me and that she wanted to make sure I take some of it.</p>
<p>"I said to her I didn't really want to because that's weird to me, but I agreed as long as that's not the main focus."</p>
<p>Campbell said he could look at using the funds for things like new clothes or possibly skin surgery at some stage later on.</p>
<p>The fundraiser is on Sunday, May 19, with the doors opening at 10am. Further information can be found on the Awa Kings or Ngā Tai o te Awa Facebook pages.</p>
