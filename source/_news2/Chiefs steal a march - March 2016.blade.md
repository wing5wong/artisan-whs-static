<p>MARSHALLING: Former Wanganui High School player Sam Malcolm (left) tried valiantly to marshal the troops for the Hurricanes but was denied by the Chiefs development squad at City College yesterday.</p>
<p>THE 43-12 scoreline reflected the control the Chiefs had over the&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;in the pre-season development rugby clash at Wanganui City College yesterday.</p>
<p>To be fair, development rugby matches are not necessarily about the gel between teammates in each side and probably more about individual playmakers and how they are able to display their skill sets.</p>
<p>During the first half possession and territory were pretty even. The difference was the&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;had far too many handling errors and were found guilty of more penalty infringements.</p>
<p>Within minutes the Chiefs were in for a well-controlled pushover try involving the entire forward pack, making it almost impossible to tell who scored. It didn't matter it put the Chiefs five points up after fullback Codey Rei failed to convert.</p>
<p>The Canes were unlucky not to score minutes later from a scrum on halfway; handling errors again let them down. However, not too long after, flanker Namani Waka crossed for the Canes after an intercept and former Wanganui High School player Sam Malcolm made no mistake with the conversion. It gave the&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;a 7-5 lead until the Chiefs bounced back with replacement player Shahn Eru crashing over under the posts. Rei converted to bring the score to 12-7 the Chiefs' way.</p>
<p>While both sides looked dangerous in the first half, and with Malcolm and former Wanganui Heartland player Samu Kubunavanua both looking sharp enough without really threatening, the match looked as though it could swing either way.</p>
<p>A penalty right on half time gave the Chiefs a further edge going into the break 15-7 up.</p>
<p>Four converted tries in the second spell to the Chiefs described the remainder of the match with second-five Sam Vaega (two) and replacements Pete Cowley and Elijah Nicholas all dotting down for the Waikato-based side. The score was suddenly 43-7 and out of the Hurricanes' grasp.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;were simply not allowed to produce what game plan they may have formed after only getting together for the first time the afternoon before.</p>
<p>A late flurry saved the&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;some face when the team was spurred on following a tremendous solo try by former Wanganui sevens player Tyler Rogers-Holden, who scooped up a loose ball on his own side of halfway and sprinted down the sideline. Rogers-Holden had come on after half time to replace starting halfback Tony Lamborn.</p>
<p>The conversion was missed from out wide to end the match at 43-12 to the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Chiefs head coach Dave Dillan was happy enough with his side's performance, while his&nbsp;Hurricanes&nbsp;counterpart Darren Larsen said his side didn't execute their skills during the match and had little chance to once the opposition had stolen a march.</p>
