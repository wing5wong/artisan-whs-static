<p><strong>Snow Skiing 2017</strong></p>
<p>Whanganui High School took two team up to this year&rsquo;s North Island Ski Champs, held on Turoa Ski Field from 17&nbsp;to 20&nbsp;of September.</p>
<p>The team came 68<sup>th </sup>and 73 out of 124 teams which was a good effort for a young team, considering the standard of skiing. Beating schools such as Hamilton Boys, Napier Girls, Palmerston North Boys and Whanganui Collegiate.</p>
<p>Some very close racing within the team with Vitek Sosnowski beating Jack Brown by .40 of a seconds and Josephine Verharren skiing very smoothly for a place in the top 30 senior women as a year 12 student. Six out of 8 students then went on to win their head to head duel on day 2 which was very pleasing.</p>
<p>With 2 out of 3 days being beautiful weather the team had a great time and are looking forward to next year.&nbsp;</p>
