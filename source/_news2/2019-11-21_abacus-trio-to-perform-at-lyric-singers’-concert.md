Lyric Singers are delighted to have Abacus Trio and Denise McNeill perform as guest artists at the choir’s ‘Piece by Piece’ concert on November 23. 

Abacus Trio was formed in 2006, by jazz pianist, Angela Crawford, who saw a need for a small jazz trio in the town. After finishing 3 years studying jazz at Massey Conservatorium of Music, now the NZ School of Music, Angela put Abacus together. With the current line-up of Murray Loveridge (bass) and **Chester Neville (drums)**, this has been a very busy group, playing at various functions around the city for many years. They play a varied mix of jazz standards, blues and contemporary styles and have played several fundraising gigs for the Sarjeant Gallery for their Musicians at the Sarjeant Sunday fund raisers. Both Angela and Murray are part of the Iconic Jazz Connexion Combo and have played together for over 30 years. They add vocalist, Denise McNeill, to the mix which sets them up for many and varied gigs around the region. 

The choir items will be interpersed with three guest artist brackets. Other guest artists include teenage musicians, Hannah Boessenkool (soprano), Savannah Priest (with Marie Brooks, piano duet) and Hideki Yutoku (violin). This concert will raise funds for Jigsaw Whanganui. The choir is conducted by Joanna Love with Lisa Boessenkool as accompanist.

‘Piece by Piece’ Saturday, 23 November, 2pm, Christ Church, Wicksteed St.

Adults $15 Children free. Tickets at the door (Cash only).
