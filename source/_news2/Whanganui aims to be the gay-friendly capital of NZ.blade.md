<p class="element element-paragraph">But, 12 years on, things have changed and England was back in his home town to perform at Whanganui's first pride week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whanganui has changed," England said. "Especially in the gay community over the last five years, I've noticed a big change. I think that's more because people from out of town are moving in."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's not the first small town in New Zealand to have Pride celebrations but Whanganui planned to take it to the next level and this year's Pride Week initiative was part of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Paul Chaplow from Whanganui and Partners - the strategic lead for tourism to the town -wanted to make Whanganui the LGBTQI capital of New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Whanganui is quite unique. For being a provincial town, there is a lot of diversity," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The city has recently implemented initiatives including same sex education and safe places for the diverse community.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Pride Week organiser Christina Emery said claiming LGBTQI capital status was still some way off.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Unfortunately there's not a lot available for certain parts of the community, like trans-gender people," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I wanted to make sure that the very basics were covered before we even started shouting from the rooftops that we were accepting and a safe place to be."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With big businesses such as Countdown coming on board and buy-in from the wider community, diversity is becoming much more mainstream.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Countdown recently got a Rainbow Tick accreditation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For us it's huge," said Trafalger Square Countdown Manager, Kristen Pinnan. "We are one of the biggest employers in the country."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It may be the beginning of significant change for Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>After its first ever Pride festival, Whanganui is now looking to become the LGBTQI capital of NZ. Made with funding from NZ On Air.</span></p>
