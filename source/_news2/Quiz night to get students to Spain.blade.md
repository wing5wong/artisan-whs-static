<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />In July this year, a group of Whanganui High School Spanish language students are going to Spain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Between now and then, fundraising activities include a quiz night this Saturday at the Gonville Bowling Club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Senior students have been asking for this [trip] for the past couple of years," says Spanish teacher Queralt Scott. "It's going to be expensive. We need 20 to go [to make it cost effective] so we opened it to photography and art students because we're going to see museums and there's a lot of art in Spain.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are 34 travelling, including students, parents, teachers and Spanish teachers Beverley Stuart and Queralt, with Head of Photography Cat Sleyer. Also involved is Sarah Hird, whose daughter Rose is going on the trip.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've been organising the quiz. We wanted a Spanish theme and my husband Grant is doing the questions," she says. Rose is also helping with questions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is a quiz night, but in between rounds they're going to have art auctions," says Cat. The art has been executed and supplied by a large number of well-known Whanganui artists. "Some good local names."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are lots of spot prizes," says Queralt. "Lots of companies have been supporting us and giving us things. Locally owned businesses have been very helpful," says Sarah.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The trip to Spain will take in as much as possible says Queralt, who is from Barcelona.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're leaving the first weekend of the July school holidays which will be winter here, but hot summer in Spain," says Queralt. The group arrives in Barcelona on Monday. From there it's a fast train to Madrid for a couple of days, after which they go to Toledo, Cordoba, Seville, Granada, Murcia and the last four days in Barcelona. On the second-to-last day there is a day trip to Girona and the Dali Museum nearby at Figueres. They arrive home on the last Sunday of the school holidays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Teams for the quiz night number six to eight people and people are encouraged to come along dressed in Hispanic theme, although it's not compulsory. Prizes will be awarded for best dressed. A bar and snacks are available. Gonville Bowling Club people are helping out on the night.<br /><strong></strong></p>
