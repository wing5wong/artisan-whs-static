<p class="element element-paragraph">Fine weather and good conditions made for a successful weekend of fishing at the 29th annual Whanganui Manawatu fishing competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A total of 273 anglers across 81 boats dropped their rods in the hope of reeling in the big one over the long weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We had an awesome weekend and were able to get in two days of great fishing, with some big fish being weighed in over all the prize categories," Wanganui Manawatu Sea Fishing Club secretary Jane Laugesen said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The committee would really like to thank our sponsors for their support. Without them we wouldn't be able to put on such a great event. We really appreciate everything they do for us."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The weather was favourable for fishing both days. The competitors were out of bed early, as the competition had a new start time of 5.30am.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The new two day format was an "absolute success", Laugesen said, with an increase in the number of boats and competitors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Paul Laugesen, Jane's father, said he has been in every competition since it began 29 years ago.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He competed again this year and said it was an excellent weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We got away both days and it was run very well this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's gradually becoming more popular every year, I'll be back next year."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The total number of fish weighed in over the two days was 471.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Laugesen said the club would really like to put an emphasis on how much they appreciate their sponsors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Result for Trevally winner - <strong>Kane Waktin</strong> 4.085kg (another former WHS stduent).</p>
