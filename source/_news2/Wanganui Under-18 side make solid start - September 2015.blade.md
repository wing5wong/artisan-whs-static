<p>The Wanganui Under-18 team got their five-game campaign off to a good start by thwarting a late comeback from Horowhenua-Kapiti with a 25-17 win in Levin on Saturday. WHS student <strong>Daniel Kauika</strong> scored the opening try and <strong>Harerangi Meihana</strong> landed a penalty shortly before halftime for a 13-7 advantage.</p>
<p>In a close match with the momentum switching throughout, Wanganui's pack laid a good foundation for their backline, with fullback Daniel Kauika scoring the opening try after some slick passing out wide.</p>
<p>Horowhenua Kapiti replied quickly when they caught Wanganui's midfield off guard and scored close to the posts to lead 7-5.</p>
<p>Wanganui replied when Callum Joblin scored out wide after a build-up through the forwards, and then Harerangi Meihana landed a penalty shortly before halftime for a 13-7 advantage.</p>
<p>The home team struck early after the break to close the gap to one point, with a good try out wide from Quaid Ponga.</p>
<p>Horowhenua-Kapiti did not succumb and with five minutes remaining they went on attack and scored again, although missing the conversion that would have given them the lead.</p>
<p>Desperate to force another score, Horowhenua-Kapiti took a chance and Wanganui's Junior Ainea intercepted in the midfield and dashed away under the posts for the match winner.</p>
<p>Wanganui U-18 now move on to their two big games against Taranaki in Hawera this weekend and Wellington at Cooks Gardens on September 12.</p>
<p>HYRC Cup games against Wellington Samoans and Horowhenua-Kapiti are to follow.</p>
