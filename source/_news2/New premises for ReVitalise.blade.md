<p class="element element-paragraph">ReVitalise Health and Fitness has outgrown its Wilson St building and has now moved to new, bigger premises in Guyton St. The weekend was spent shifting everything into the new building.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a big step up for us," says Audrey O'Keefe, ReVitalise owner. Although the business moved in and opened on Monday, there is an official opening day this Saturday, September 9.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">ReVitalise opened in August 2009 in Victoria Ave, with the small space divided between a supplements shop and a small gym. The move to Wilson St five years ago meant Audrey could build a bigger gym while still retaining the supplements and nutrition side of the business.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Growing membership and the need for an enlarged gym space has necessitated the move to Guyton St.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The supplement shop will be twice as big," says Audrey.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Signwritten by Marty Esau from Gorilla Graphics, the building is testament to the success of ReVitalise.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is a good size and it will mean we'll probably get some more guys as well." Audrey says that with less of a 'boutique' look, more men might join, although core business is still women, weight loss and getting healthy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"About 90 per cent of our clientele have never been to a gym before. I'm really blessed that my clients are my advertising."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Audrey says it's not all about weight loss.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"For me, it's about getting healthy. I've got clients trying to put on weight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Most of my clients are sick and tired of being sick and tired."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Audrey's youngest client is 10 and the oldest is 78.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We don't do diets; we teach you how to eat."</p>
