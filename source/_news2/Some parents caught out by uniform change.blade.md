<p class="element element-paragraph">Parents of Whanganui High School seniors are being told not to fret over a uniform change many were concerned would force them into forking out for clothes that could be worn for as little as 16 weeks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">New uniform regulations say senior students, those in their final two years at school, should wear black shorts or black skirts costing $55 and $85 respectively.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The change followed a uniform review Whanganui High School carried out in 2017 and parents were notified of the change in an email at the end of that year, and again in a special newsletter in October.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The mother of a boy in Year 13 and a daughter in Year 12 said she had received the email outlining the changes, but it still came as a surprise to her.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Of course I read it and it said there would be a 15-month transition period and then I promptly forgot about it. As you do, because life happens.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I went to get the new uniform for my daughter, just a new top ... they said 'Oh right yes, the uniform is changing so if she wants a new skirt she'll have to get this black skirt', and I went 'Pardon?'"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She's buying her daughter, starting Year 12, the new skirt but she doesn't want to buy her son, who is in Year 13, a pair of shorts for one school year. All parents with Year 13 students had a right to be frustrated by the additional cost for clothes, she said, because the students might wear them for the only two summer terms, totalling 16 weeks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The mother said her understanding was the transition period was still going at the beginning of the 2019 school year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My son is in Year 13 and he needs the new black shorts. But I'm looking at it that we still have a few months of the transition period left so I'm not getting him the black shorts at the moment and then in term four he can wear his formal uniform.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a solution that will work for us rather than to spend money on an additional piece of clothing when he doesn't need it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The mother was also concerned the new uniforms would be uncomfortable, especially on hot summer days.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm concerned about black skirts and shorts for the seniors in the summer time because it's going to be hot ... I hadn't expected it to be black."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said a number of parents she had spoken to were also frustrated about the cost of buying clothes for such a short period of time,</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another parent of a Year 13 boy, Diana Jackson, said she was aware of many parents who were caught out by the change.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Apparently the school sent an email December 2017 ... that's a while ago!</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't understand the need for any changes ... why have seniors in one colour and juniors in another? Most parents I've spoken to on social media aren't purchasing new $55 shorts for their last year of school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'll probably get my son his ... but I'm really not happy. Surely more emails or notices in paper would have been beneficial, a lot of parents don't know. Even then I can't understand the need for black shorts and skirts ... grey's been fine for many years now. Why fix what isn't broken [especially] when money is tight for so many?"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School principal Martin McAllen has said the school would not be strict about the uniform change in 2019.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is always essential to have a period of flexibility in the first year any uniform items become compulsory," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I am also extremely aware of - and sensitive to - the great range of financial capacities and resources we have throughout our large school community of nearly 1500 students and whanau."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McAllen said a special newsletter outlining the 2019 uniform list was sent to parents in October 2018.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The uniform change was largely the result of a survey in 2017 that drew more than 800 responses from parents, students and staff.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The survey was compiled and assessed by a review team made of McAllen, as well as the chairman of the Board of Trustees, Randal Southee, board members, student representatives and teachers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Andersons, the store that sells the uniforms, met with the review team to discuss what options were available.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The owner of Andersons, Darrell Smith, said he had not had too many complaints from parents coming into the store.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think the school's been fairly upfront with what it's done and tried to communicate. There may be the odd parent that feels they haven't been informed," Smith said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said they were starting to get more parents coming in as the school year got closer. Term one starts on January 28.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's starting to pick up ... starting to get a bit of volume rolling in the door. It'll just keep increasing as the month goes through."</p>

<h3 class="element element-heading">Uniform chosen for its <em>versatility</em></h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The new black skirt that makes up the senior girls uniform at Whanganui High School was chosen for its versatility, according to the manager of the uniform shop, Andersons.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Robyn Voullaire said the skirt will be able to be used for more than just going to school in.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The reason that black skirt was chosen was because it's a simple plain, straight black skirt and it's a very, very nice quality skirt," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's ideal for a senior student to wear to a job interview or to wear to an after-school job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a very, very simple garment to slide into an adult wardrobe as a basic. And it's something that you could wear for corporate. It's something that you could wear to just any job you could think of. It's also suitable to wear to a tangi."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said the skirt was an A-line skirt that had a back vent allowing for mobility.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Andersons also buys old uniforms in relatively good condition, which helps parents transitioning their children to the senior uniform.</p>
