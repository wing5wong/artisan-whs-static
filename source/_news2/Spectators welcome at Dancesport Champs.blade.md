<p><span>WHS student Jared Sim (left) will be one of the competitors at the Dancesport Champs.</span></p>
<p><span>The annual River City Dancesport Champs will be held at the Wanganui War Memorial Centre on Saturday, May 5. Formerly known as Ballroom Dancing, the event still encompasses the styles of Standard, Latin American and New Vogue. Quickly becoming one of the most popular provincial Dancesport competitions in NZ, it attracts competitors from Whangarei in the north to as far south as Nelson. The Whanganui War Memorial Centre</span><span class="text_exposed_show">, having a sprung floor, is a big drawcard for dancers.The date for this years event has been brought forward to accommodate the WWMC closure for earthquake strengthening. Mark, from Glastonbury&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Dance Studio, would like to thank the strong support from sponsors enabling us to secure the venue again for 2018. Doors will open to the public at 11.30am with Eftpos available.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">A full programme promises to showcase talented couples in all age groups displaying Ballroom Dancing at it's best.</span></p>
