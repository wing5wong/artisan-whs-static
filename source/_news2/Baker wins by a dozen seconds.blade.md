<p><span><strong>Whanganui High School junior girls winner Rebecca Baker</strong> keeps ahead of senior girls winner Caitlyn Alabaster in their combined 3000m race on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>The young ones showed their seniors how its done at the Whanganui Secondary Schools Cross Country along the Collegiate golf course on Thursday.</p>
<p>Organisers chose to combine the junior and senior grades into one race, with seperate placings, in order to create more competition for overall finishes.</p>
<p>Alec McNab said the decision worked a treat as several contenders to do well at nationals on June 17 in Christchurch, who would not normally race each other, got to elevate their performances.</p>
<p>"By combining grades, we've got a good race, there's no doubt about that."</p>
<p>Whanganui High School's 15-year-old junior prospect <strong>Rebecca Baker</strong> proved it as she beat out Wanganui Collegiate's seniors Caitlyn Alabaster and Jane Lennox in the dash to the line.</p>
<p>Alabaster, who was coming back from a stress fracture and will race 4km in Christchurch, stayed with Baker until they headed down the undulating back stretch on the final lap of the course.</p>
<p>Baker then turned on the gas to open up the gap and held on to win by a comfortable 12s.</p>
<p>"It's good to run in a bigger field," she said.</p>
<p>"I just sort of kept running and just dragged away, [Alabaster] just kept falling off."</p>
<p>While the combined senior and junior boys race did not have as many standout competitors, Collegiate's Liam Back continued to mark himself as a name of the future by dominating proceedings with a winning margin of one and a half minutes.</p>
<p>"That's not saying the seniors were pathetic - we've just got two outstanding juniors," said McNab.</p>
<p>"Liam Back's performance was remarkable, he won by the biggest margin of the day."</p>
<p>Notably, Back's finish beat the winning time at last year's nationals for the junior boys by 15s.</p>
<p>"He could have had a cup of tea by the time the next runner came along," said McNab.</p>
<p><strong>WHS got to sweep the board in the senior version of the boys race with Liam Jones, Connor Munro and Travis Bayler taking the podium spots.</strong></p>
<p>Collegiate managed two clean sweeps through the senior girls (Alabaster, Lennox, Sarah Lambert) and Year 9 girls (Ashleigh Alabaster, Ana Brabyn, Jessica Johnstone).</p>
<p>Around 178 athletes entered this year's championships, which were held in much better weather conditions compared to the monsoon rain of 2016.</p>
<p>The top three finishers in each grade secured automatic spots for the Christchurch nationals, with a further two runners to be added to each.</p>
<p>Titles are also awarded to the competing schools through the 3-to-score and 6-to-score categories.</p>
<p>Last year Collegiate won 10 of those 12 events, but Thursday saw a swing back towards some of the running talent from the other schools as Collegiate won seven while WHS claimed three and City College and Nga Tawa got one each.</p>
<p><strong>WHS coach Greg Fromont was extremely pleased with the overall results for the day from his 42 runners.</strong></p>
