<p><span>CAPTAIN JESS: Whanganui's Jessica Watkin is leading her CD women's team by example at the national Under-21 tournament in Auckland.</span></p>
<p>Versatile Whanganui cricketer Jess Watkin is doing her bit to lead the Central Districts women to back-to-back national Under-21 titles in Auckland this week.</p>
<p>The 2015/16 winners, admittedly were a wee bit off the pace at the start of play yesterday morning against Northern Districts who co-led the table with Auckland with only one loss apiece as the tournament moved to the Twenty/20 format.</p>
<p>Earlier Central had wins against Wellington and Canterbury and losses to Otago and Auckland. Central began yesterday tied for third with Wellington and Otago with matches against Northern and Wellington again to come.</p>
<p>In an intense standoff against Northern yesterday morning Central won by one solitary run after setting a modest 150/6 in the twenty/20 encounter. Watkin second top scored with the bat when run out on 30, while she took one of the three Northern wickets.</p>
<p>Central manager Michelle Mitchell said the narrowest of wins came down to two crucial quick runsouts in the 16th over.</p>
<p>"We need to win our next two games and hope Auckland don't if we are to retain our title,' Mitchell said.</p>
<p>The Wellington match was scheduled to go well into last evening beyond Chronicle deadline and then Central are to shape up against Canterbury this morning.</p>
<p>Central started the tournament on a winning note beating Wellington despite a top showing by White Fern and the capital skipper Amelia Kerr's unbeaten 119 helping her side to a respectable 269.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chase was set up between openers Melissa Hansen and Tayla Brown, putting on 143 before Brown was bowled for 57. Captain Watkin and Hansen added 38 before Hansen was run out for 83. It could have gone downhill for Central, but Watkin led her team to victory with a 67 off 50 balls.</p>
<p>Central then stuttered when beaten by Otago. After sending the southern side in to bat Central would have been feeling pleased with the decision after three early wickets from Watkin.</p>
<p>The Otago women were all out off 46.1 overs for 191 runs. Central failed to reach the target however when all out for 141 off 40.1 overs falling 52 runs short.<br />Watkin was at her best again in the win over Canterbury scoring an unbeaten 127 to set up a chase of 302/3. Canterbury replied with 294/8.</p>
<p>In the rain-affected clash with Auckland the match was shortened to 40 overs after Central initially set a target of 145/9 from 34.2 overs.</p>
<p>Auckland came into bat with the slightlt shortened target of 132 off 40 overs and reached that figure with the loss of just two wickets.</p>
