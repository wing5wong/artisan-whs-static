A fantastic time was had by our students at the North Island Snowboard Champs at Turoa Ski Field from 23-25 September.

With over 220 competitors competing across three disciplines, including Banked Slalom, Boarder Cross and Slope Style. 

Whanganui High School entered with 3 competitors;
Max Verhaaren, Thomas Iliffe and Artem Kovalchuk.

Max finished 46th in Banked Slalom.
