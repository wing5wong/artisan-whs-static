<p class="element element-paragraph">Three of Whanganui's top speed skaters head to a training camp in Timaru this weekend for skaters eligible for selection for the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires where speed skating will be an official sport for the first time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Current/former WHS students Renee Teers and Monique Cleeve</strong>; and Chase Morpeth have been invited to attend the camp although Morpeth is not old enough to be eligible for this year's event but the selectors feel he is a prospect for the next Olympics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The skaters will be put through their paces by New Zealand World's coach Bill Begg and attend lectures on nutrition and sports psychology.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Teers and Cleeve were both at the top of their game at the National Banked Track championships in Hamilton a fortnight ago, despite rain causing cancellation of most races.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Teers was the standout</strong>, the 15-year-old winning the Open Women's 15km race from Timaru's Ariana Snook and Leah MacDonald, both New Zealand representatives at last year's world championships, powering away on the last lap.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Teers was also a strong second to MacDonald in the Youth Olympic 5km distance event for age eligible skaters. Cleeve came on strong at the end to pip Snook for third on the line in a closely contested race.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Most skaters did not get to race their age group events due to the weather, but one of those who did was Drew Brennan. The youngster continued his fine form from the Road and Track Nationals in Timaru to race to a comfortable win in the Juvenile Boys 3km race.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mickey Zhang picked up a silver in the Primary Boys 1500m and Deborah Smith a silver in the Masters Womens 5km points race behind Sarah Stack from Nelson.</p>
