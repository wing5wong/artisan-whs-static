<p class="element element-paragraph">Two diverse pottery exhibitions sit side by side at Rick Rudd's Quartz Museum of Studio Ceramics in Bates St.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In one room, an eclectic selection from the collection of Ann and Paul McNamara, chosen by Ann and therefore titled&nbsp;<em>Ann's Choice</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the exhibition space next door is a wild profusion of colour and design from Fiona Sibbald's collection of Crown Lynn pottery, an exhibition called&nbsp;<em>Fiona Has Designs on Crown Lynn</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">You could not get two more different displays.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Ann's Choice</em>&nbsp;features pieces chosen for different reasons, but, like the Crown Lynn collection, many of them are practical.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ann has chosen work by local potter Ross Mitchell-Anyon, including her favourite casserole dish.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What I like about his work is that you can see the hand of the potter."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She has also picked pieces of an entirely different kind.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've always had an interest in art &hellip; objects appeal to me, particularly objects that are of nature, so if you look at most of these objects you'll see something about plants or animals. I like the whole idea of natural forms, and then a lot of the pottery is utilitarian as well."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She likes the tactile nature of ceramics, whether in the shape or texture of the glaze.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Ross's work appeals because not only are they really good to look at but you can also use them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Ann's Choice</em>&nbsp;is work from different potters, some quirky, some serious, some unusual, some playful, all of it worth a look.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Some of the represented potters spent time working for Crown Lynn. There are works by Paul Maseyk, a former student of Ross Mitchell-Anyon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ann says lovers of ceramics owe a great deal to Rick Rudd and Quartz.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Responses to ceramics are always emotional," says Rick.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ann says she gets a lot of pleasure sharing beautiful and useful pieces of pottery with dinner guests.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They're an art form: they make you feel good," she says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>The art forms are very different in the Crown Lynn collection, but no less important.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Again, the response to the display is emotional &mdash; nostalgia. Fiona Sibbald has been collecting Crown Lynn since 2004 and runs a Facebook page called Crown Lynn Skite Site. She is no stranger to pottery, having spent 13 years in London as a retail manager for Royal Doulton.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her exhibition is a brave mix of traditional patterns, children's designs, animals and the ubiquitous squares, dots and abstract lines that once graced the kitchen tables of New Zealand.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are plates made especially for occasions like the 1970 Expo, plates made for Bellamy's at Parliament, pieces designed by celebrated potters and all very collectable. The exhibition also features hand-painted plates.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Crown Lynn operated for more than 50 years, closing the factory in 1989.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is part of New Zealand's history now," says Rick. "We need people like Fiona to do this."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Ann's Choice</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Fiona Has Designs on Crown Lynn</em>&nbsp;are on display at Quartz until September 24.</strong></p>
