<p>Former WHS student, Martin Atkinson, left, in action for Central during the Ford National Hockey League.</p>
<p>Whanganui hockey export Martin Atkinson has been in strong form for Central in the Ford National Hockey League this month.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old former NZ Futures Under 23 representative had connected with eight field goals in five matches so far - second on the overall list behind North Harbour's Robbie Capizzi with nine.</p>
<p>Atkinson's Central team was set to face Auckland at the ITM Hockey Centre in Whangarei yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>He scored a hat trick in Central's 4-1 win over Midlands in their opening match on September 3.</p>
<p>The following day, Atkinson scored again in the 2-2 draw with Capital, along with taking the winning shot at the end of the penalty shootout to give his team the duke 3-2.</p>
<p>He did not score on September 10 in Central's 3-1 loss to competition leaders Canterbury, but the following day got the crucial 60th minute score to tie the match with North Harbour 3-3, although they would go on to lose the penalty shootout 2-1.</p>
<p>Atkinson was back in form on Tuesday as Central thrashed Northland 10-0, with the Whanganui representative grabbing another hat trick.</p>
<p>He will be heading off to South Australia to play at the end of the national league.</p>
