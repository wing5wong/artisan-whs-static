<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Lightning hope this weekend is the chance to finally go all the way and win their home round of the Lower North Island Inline Hockey League at Jubilee Stadium.<br /><em>Photo / File</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the past two years, the Lightning have finished second when it's their turn to host the weekend of games, both times to the top side Rimutaka Renegades and despite last year drawing the matchup between them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In a change of format, this weekend is the third round of five, compared to four rounds in 2017.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The first two rounds were in Levin, where the Lightning had a loss and a draw in the first weekend, then a loss and a win at the second.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're hoping that this weekend at home we'll come away with a victory," said club secretary/manager Rhiannon Vale.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I said to them, 'we want to be on top of the table'."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lightning followed up last year's regional league by coming third at the nationals in New Plymouth, and hope to have a similar strong showing this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At the 2017 Whanganui round, the side did not have their specialist goalie available and had to rotate 3-4 players through the position.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This year, they have been joined by Canadian Liam Bissell, who is adjusting from his background as an ice hockey goaltender.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another team newcomer is Boris Kristofik, originally from Slovakia.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The rest are all returning players (and former WHS students) in the</strong> <strong>O'Donnell brothers; James and Kieran,&nbsp;</strong> <strong>while the</strong> <strong>Ashworth family provides a trio of siblings; Josh, Matthew and Joel.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The other team members are</strong> <strong>Brett Buckeridge,</strong> <strong>Josh Hamilton,</strong> Rob Marks, and Pita Marshall.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Kieran O'Donnell scored 14 goals at last year's Whanganui round, while James O'Donnell got nine and Matthew Ashworth five.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Lightning start at 9am on Saturday</strong> against the Levin Rebels, who beat them in the opening game last year, which is why they ultimately finished second.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The big one will be at 5.15pm against the Rimutaka Renegades.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>On Sunday, the Lightning meet the Tawa Typhoons at 9.55am, then wrap up their weekend against the Capital Penguins at 12.40pm.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There will be a sausage sizzle the team is running on both days, sponsored by Wanganui Toyota, Flooring Xtra Wanganui and Masterbuilt.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The fourth round is tentatively scheduled to be held in Kilbirnie in Wellington, before the fifth round is back in Levin.</p>
