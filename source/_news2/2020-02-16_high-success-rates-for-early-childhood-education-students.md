Whanganui training provider Training For You has produced another group of successful graduates from its Early Childhood Education (ECE) foundation programme. Three of the providerâ€™s most recent ECE graduates are now prepared to take their learning and practical training further into tertiary studies.

The 20-week ECE programme provides an introduction to the knowledge and skills involved in the education and care of infants, toddlers and children in New Zealand.  Graduates of the programme gain 60 credits, and are awarded the New Zealand Certificate in Early Childhood Education and Care, Level 3.

The course prepares learners to work at an entry level within a variety of early childhood settings. Students gain practical hands-on experience in a local ECE environment to develop their potential as early childhood educators.  

The course provides essential learning for those who want to move on to higher education and Training For You is now able to offer the on-campus programme with zero fees.

Recent Working With Children graduates **Jackie Mayson** (former WHS student), Shontae Stevenson, and Amelia Wylie all completed the Level 3 course with Training For You last year. They graduated at a special ceremony in December.  All three have enrolled with UCOL Whanganui for 2020, where they will study toward gaining the New Zealand Diploma in Early Childhood Education, Level 5.

Training For You is accepting enrolments now for the next ECE intake, with a start date of 10th February
