<p class="element element-paragraph">Women's Refuge Whanganui is better off to the tune of almost $900, thanks to an enterprising idea from&nbsp;<em>Wanganui Chronicle</em>&nbsp;advertising consultant Christina Forsyth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Forsyth first developed an advertising feature based on the Women's Refuge annual appeal in 2016 and 15 per cent of the revenue generated from the feature was gifted to the branch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 2018 feature which appeared in both the&nbsp;<em>Chronicle</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Midweek</em>&nbsp;last month generated an $872 donation this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There were 29 Whanganui businesses supporting it this year," said Forsyth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Women's Refuge Whanganui manager Heather said the donation will be a big help towards transport and accommodation costs for families in crisis.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We appreciate all the funding we get, of course, but this donation is especially helpful because we can use it where it is most needed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Donations like this are always appreciated and we welcome volunteers to answer the phone for our crisis line.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We will be running training sessions for volunteers soon."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Local children have also been supporting the charity with donations of artworks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Pupils at Keith St, Te Kura o Kokohuia, Aranui and James Cook School in Marton have been working on their ideas about what makes happy families.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Forsyth said the support from advertisers has been fantastic and the general response has been that local business is "proud" to support refuge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Thank you to all the Whanganui businesses that were involved in this successful feature, we couldn't have done it without you."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She began working with Women's Refuge Whanganui shortly after starting work at NZME more than two years ago and says it is "really satisfying" to give back to such a wonderful organisation.</p>
