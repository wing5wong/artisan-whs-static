<h4>Prefect Camp 2019</h4>
<p>With the 2019 School Year still just beginning the Whanganui High School Prefect team took to the streets of Wellington on the 20th-21st of March to participate in team bonding activities in order to grow closer as a prefect team.</p>
<p><span>The prefects were split into 6 groups with a 7th team (The teacher team) and were sent around Wellington completing many tasks in order to finish first in the "Whanganui High School Amazing Race" with the "Fire Breathing Rubber Duckies" taking out the title. </span></p>
<p><span>The race involve immense amounts of teamwork and a complete sense of unity as well as a lot of fun.&nbsp;</span></p>
