IAG offer trade scholarships in building and other trades to cover the cost of doing an apprenticeship. These scholarships cover the cost of books, paperwork and exams organised by the Building Construction Industry Training Organisation (BCITO), over the duration of the apprenticeship. Applicants have to apply and be interviewed.

Four staff at Wat’sOn Building have been accepted in recent years with former WHS student **Joshuwa Old** being the latest. He was presented with his scholarship as well as having his starter tools being supplied by Bunnings, at the recent IAG Trades Scholarship presentation in Wellington. At the same presentation, James Dowman was congratulated for completing his scholarship and apprenticeship and becoming a Tradesman Carpenter.
