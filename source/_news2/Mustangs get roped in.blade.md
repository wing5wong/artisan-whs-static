<p>WHS old boy <strong>Trent Hemi</strong> shared pitching duties with Danny Green in Mustangs&rsquo; 4-2 loss to Levin United on Saturday.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Whanganui sides playing in the Manawatu men&rsquo;s softball league had contrasting results on Palmerston North diamonds on Saturday. Castlecliff Club Mustangs suffered their third defeat of the season when going down 4-2 in a tense game of softball to Levin United.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Mustangs got off to a dream start in the Manawatu senior men&rsquo;s reserve grade match when lead-off batter Jefferson Yacap hit deep to centre field, scoring a home run. Levin replied with two runs after their batters put five hits together. No further runs were scored until Yacap stepped up and slammed his second homer of the day to tie the scores.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">In the next innings, Levin came out firing, hitting safely to have a runner on first. The next batter hit a deep low drive to right field, scoring himself and the runner. The Mustangs then put bat to ball with some big hits, only to be taken out with some spectacular catches in the outfield.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Mustangs had six batters left on base, but they could not score them.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data"><strong>Trent Hemi</strong> and Danny Green shared the pitching duties for the Mustangs collecting nine strikeouts between them.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Tewha Martini continues to improve, taking some fine outs in the outfield. Regan Calder had a solid game at third base. Yacap topped the batting with a 1000 average.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t switch on today and Levin made us pay &mdash; lesson learned,&rdquo; coach Ron Hollis said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The Castlecliff Club Black team had a good win over Linton Mustangs 8-4.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Devon Maihi pitched well for the Mustangs holding down a strong Linton batting lineup.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Bailey Kiwara continued his good batting, slamming a home run.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Ezi Finance Wanganui Braves also suffered a narrow loss, going down 2-0 to the army lads from Linton in the Manawatu senior men&rsquo;s premier grade match in Palmerston North at the weekend.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Braves have been low on numbers in recent weeks and was slammed 15-5 by Raiders last week after defaulting the previous weekend.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Player/coach Shane Foster said Brad Worsley again pitched well, although opposition batters were starting to shorten the bat and square up to move the ball, putting pressure on the Braves&rsquo; defence. &ldquo;Our batters just couldn&rsquo;t get going, although new player <strong>Eli Fleming</strong> (WHS old boy) got a hit.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;He normally plays slow pitch, but showed he has potential in the batters box and in the field at shortstop,&rdquo; Foster said.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Meanwhile, on Sunday, March 10 Mustangs take on Braves in a local Whanganui derby at Softball Ball Park in Puriri St.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">The friendly game starts at 1pm and is designed to promote the adult game in Whanganui.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Folk are welcome to get along and see some of Whanganui&rsquo;s finest show their wares.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">A public address system will provide running commentary and food and drinks will be on sale and giveaways will be handed out for the children attending.</p>
