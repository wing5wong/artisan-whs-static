<p>A Mini Teen Ag event was held at the Wanganui Racecourse on the morning of Wednesday 26 September 2018.</p>
<p>This was the culmination of my Integrated Studies class where we have been studying Agriculture.</p>
<p>There were local Whanganui organisations there running short modules on a variety of topics including tractor safety, weed identification and Dairy NZ.</p>
<p>We finished off with a sausage sizzle and prizegiving.</p>
