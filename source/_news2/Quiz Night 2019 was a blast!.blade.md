<h4>Quiz Night 2019 was a blast!</h4>
<p>We had a full hall of participants this year, all in creative costumes - including our Best Dressed, &lsquo;Rich Gang&rsquo; (Jesus and his disciples).</p>
<p>The night was full of delicious food, spot prizes, minigames such as a planking competition (which we had an amazing turn out for!) and 100 awesome quiz questions .</p>
<p>A special congratulations to our winning team, &lsquo;Patea Maori Club&rsquo;, and well done to everybody that participated on the night.</p>
<p>An amazing atmosphere and an amazing group of participants, congrats everyone!</p>
