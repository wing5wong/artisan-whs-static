<p><strong>Whanganui High School has welcomed its new principal.</strong></p>
<p>Martin McAllen started at the school about three weeks ago, replacing Garry Olver who resigned after a period of poor health.</p>
<p>Mr McAllen comes to the school from Manurewa High in South Auckland, where he spent four years as deputy principal.</p>
<p>With more than 2000 students, Manurewa is the largest decile one school in New Zealand. Students from more than 40 different countries are represented there.</p>
<p>"There were lots of good things happening at the school," Mr McAllen said.</p>
<p>However, he was attracted to Whanganui by the opportunity of being a principal.</p>
<p>"I was keen to lead a school, and to have the ability to shape the direction of a school. There are so many amazing students and great staff members at Whanganui High School."</p>
<p>Mr McAllen was also keen on the location because he has "always liked Whanganui".</p>
<p>"As a child I used to visit my aunt here during the holidays, so I have happy memories of the place. I love the history, the river, the artistic activities here - and I think Kai Iwi beach is beautiful."</p>
<p>Mr McAllen was born in Taupo and raised in Auckland. He studied at the University of Auckland and the Christchurch College of Education, where he trained to be an English teacher. He also has a masters degree in education leadership.</p>
<p>He taught in Taumarunui and Hamilton before moving back to Auckland. He has a particular interest in literacy and in special needs education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr McAllen and his wife, Sandy - also an English teacher - have two adult daughters. Jess is a freelance journalist, while Amy is an English student at Massey University in Palmerston North.</p>
<p>He's keen on sport - "I believe in a balance between academic and sporting pursuits" - and particularly enjoys athletics and football.</p>
<p>"At every school I've taught at I've coached athletics or football, or both," he said.</p>
<p>Mr McAllen's family has also been involved with the guide dog movement for several years. One of the family's three dogs was guide dog-trained but didn't quite make the grade; while another is a former guide dog who has now retired.</p>
<p>He was welcomed to Whanganui High School with a powhiri at the end of January, and last week took part in the powhiri to welcome 300 year 9 students and their families to the school.</p>
<p>He has also had dinner with the principals of other Whanganui secondary schools and hopes to develop good connections with them.</p>
<p>He believes the High School has the possibility for "a real bicultural approach to learning", with a school roll that is 67 per cent pakeha and 25 per cent Maori (with around eight per cent international students).</p>
<p>"I want to make sure that learning is kept relevant for all students, and that all students are given the best possible opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>"I'm excited to be here. It's a great school to be coming in to," Mr McAllen said.</p>
