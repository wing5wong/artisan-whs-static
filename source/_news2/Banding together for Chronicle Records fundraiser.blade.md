<p class="element element-paragraph">When the Chronicle Records studio was broken into late last year it was a major blow for Whanganui musicians.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Expensive microphones were stolen and equipment damaged or ruined.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The losses mean that local musicians will be unable to record until things are repaired or replaced.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui rock band Kessel had recently recorded at the studio and vocalist Jason Lane wanted to help the studio by organising a fundraiser.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The break-in is not only setting the studio back but the Whanganui muso community as a whole.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've decided to spearhead a bit of a fundraiser for the great team at Chronicle to recoup some of what can never really be replaced."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lucky Bar + Kitchen has agreed to host the fundraiser at its Wilson St venue tonight.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are suggesting a $10 door charge but we're hoping that people will just give a koha of whatever they can afford for a good cause," says owner Georgie Ormond.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ormond, her partner Matt Edmonds and Dave Muso will debut their band The Mean Owls playing half a dozen originals and local band Pull Down the Sun will join the show, playing their "groove-heavy music shaped and inspired by the curious history and scenic nature of Aotearoa."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It should be a good night and we hope it will make a decent contribution towards helping Chronicle Records get back to full capability."</p>
