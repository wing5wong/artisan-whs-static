Vintage Weekend treated us to a feast of music, and the Whanganui Musicians’ Club is one place where the music keeps coming all year long, featuring the monthly club night on the first Friday of every month.

Local musicians are invited to put their names on the board and play a few songs before the invited bands take to the stage. It’s a formula that stands the test of time.

February’s edition is shaping up to be a stormer, as we welcome home three young guns who are creating the music of today. Based in Wellington, Bad Hagrid is the band’s name. Here, in their own words, is a description of their adventure:

“Legends speak of a being so dastardly, so monstrous, that the mere mention of his name is enough to send even the most hardened souls into a cold sweat. The creature’s name — Bad Hagrid. No-one has ever met the beast and lived to tell the tale. That is, until today.

“Bad Hagrid are an ‘alternative-progressiveregressive-banana-brainedankle-sprained-hipster-sisterpsychedelic-synth-rock’ fourpiece comprising Whanganuians **Te Paerata Tichbon, Finn Mitchell-Anyon and Shay Wright** (all ex WHS students), alongside non-Whanganuian Hakopa Kuka-Larsen. This weekend, they return home to regale you with tales of their journeys through far-off lands — including their new single, Rose — a high-energy, riffcentric journey featuring complex rhythms and fierce vocals.”

Joining the party from the Ka¯ piti Coast are jazz maestro Geoff Culverwell and Robert Kingi, playing improvisations on modern grooves. Horns, voice, percussion and acoustic guitar are treated with electronic effects.

Friday, February 7 at the Musicians’ Club, 65 Drews Ave. Doors open at 7pm, with the music playing until 11pm. $15 General Admission, $10 for members. Memberships available at the door.
