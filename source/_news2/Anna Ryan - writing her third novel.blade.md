<p><span><strong>Anna Ryan is only 24, works full time but has been able to publish two books on Amazon in the last three months.</strong> The first was &lsquo;The Lady in the Coat&rsquo; written in the horror/mystery genre and her second book published earlier this month is &lsquo;Amelia.&rdquo; It will be the first in a detective series under the title of &lsquo;Sly and Hoki.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&lsquo;Amelia&rsquo; is available through Amazon in both kindle and paperback versions, while her first book is available only on&nbsp;</span><span class="text_exposed_show">kindle. Both are shorter books making them easy to read. She is hoping that her books will soon be available in bookshops in Whanganui.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Anna enjoyed writing at <strong>Whanganui High School</strong> but wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in reading until she was introduced to the writings of Jodie Picoult, the well-known American writer. It was Picoult&rsquo;s &lsquo;Change of Heart&rsquo; that changed Anna&rsquo;s attitude. She enjoyed the different perspectives used by Picoult and the fact that her writing makes you think. Her other favourite authors are Stephen King and Agatha Christie.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Her initial motivation to write was the death of her nana. &lsquo;The Lady in the Coat&rsquo; represents death and expresses the way Anna felt at the time. &ldquo;It helped to take my mind off her death.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">She writes mainly in the evenings and says, &ldquo;You know when you have a good story line as writing becomes easy.&rdquo; In the long-term she would love to be a full time author.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">To check out Anna&rsquo;s books go to Amazon and search under the name of her books.</span></p>
