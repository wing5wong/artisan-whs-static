<p><br />It has been a week full of compliments and smiles as Whanganui High School takes the lead on activities for Bullying-Free Week.</p>
<p>Student leaders from the four school houses have run activities since Monday to focus heavily on anti-bullying.</p>
<p>"We have some fantastic young leaders who want to make our school a safe, happy and inclusive environment for all," says deputy principle, Jenny Langrish.</p>
<p>'Compliment for a Cookie' and 'Smile project' had students writing compliments and kind messages to receive a free cookie or cup of hot chocolate.</p>
<p>"Spread the love" saw the students come together on the school field to make a giant heart holding pieces of pink paper.</p>
<p>The school badge and motto was amended for the week to " Whanganui High School; that we night not bully" and from the traditional green to pink, the colour of the anti-bullying campaign.</p>

<p><br />Langrish, says the school has really focused in on anti-bullying by including daily presentations at school assemblies from senior constable Paul Miller, school community officer with the Whanganui Police.</p>
<p>"We hope to educate our students about making the right decisions and taking a stance against bullying, whether this is in the form of words, physical contact or through social media," she says.</p>
<p>Miller's first presentation addressed social media bullying and included advice on where students could go to get help.</p>
<p>Langrish says the school really appreciates the support of the local police in educating students on the dangers of cyber bullying.</p>
<p>"The students who have viewed the safe use of social media video have been very attentive and receptive to the message given."</p>
<p>The week is an annual event organised by the Bullying Prevention Advisory Group. This year's theme is 'Celebrating Being Us' - creating the opportunity for students to find out more about what makes them unique.</p>
<p>Pink Shirt Day, on Friday, wraps up the week.</p>
