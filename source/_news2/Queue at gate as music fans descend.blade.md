<p class="element element-paragraph">They were lining up hours before the gates even opened.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the end about 450 packed out Dean and Marian Butler's property for the 10th annual Pauls Road Live music festival.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Festival goers did their best to find shade to enjoy the day of music as the late summer sun beat down.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Acts this year included Andy Anderson &amp; Tripsplat, The Blues Buffet, Reset, Burns the Bridges, Whiskey Mama, Craig &amp; Angie and Bullfrog Rata &amp; the Troublemakers featuring Jamie Knap.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr Butler said they always aimed for a good mix of music.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's a lot of good musicians in Whanganui and a lot we have to turn away," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think people that come like that it's all pretty relaxed here, the setting and the good line-up of music."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The festival began about noon and continued into the evening.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We sort of carry on a bit, some people have the day off the next day. Then we've got clean up tomorrow," Mr Butler said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The gates were supposed to open at 11.30am but we had people turning up at eight o'clock.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We couldn't ask for a better day.''</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The festival has been running since 2008. All proceeds go to the Starlit Hope charity which helps children with cancer and their families.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">About $3000 is raised each year and this year it will be given to three families.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's a lot of planning and a lot of meetings and I build the stage to make it look like a bit of a Woodstock thing," Mr Butler said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There's a lot of helpers though."</p>
