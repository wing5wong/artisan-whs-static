<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui will have its own Project Runway moment this month, with a local star of the New Zealand version of the show on hand to share his experience with aspiring models.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Carla Jayne Smith, of Embrace Model Management, is organising a workshop on March 30 for people aged 13-plus to learn about modelling and is bringing in some top talent to help on the day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jo Mickelborough, scout and booker for leading model and talent agency Red11, will be the guest facilitator.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her main role with Red11 is looking after new models and helping them on their journey.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She also loves fashion and has worked with many designers, including 10 years with Zambesi.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fashion designer and pattern maker Kerry Trent Ranginui, originally of Whanganui and one of the finalists in last year's "Project Runway NZ" show, will talk about his experiences on the show and working with models.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui has worked alongside international fashion designer Karen Walker for more than eight years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're holding the workshop at the pilot academy at the airport which will be a great venue," Smith said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This year the agency will have a big focus on etiquette and good manners. It's about confidence building. I'd like as many teens as possible to be there to learn from Jo and Kerry.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Jo's background is in dance - she's been a choreographer and a producer - so she's very graceful and elegant. She will focus on the fundamentals of modelling as well as posture and poise.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Kerry will model with them and will talk about his experience on Project Runway and what's happened since. We all want to know, right. He'll also talk about his expectations, as a designer, of his models."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There is a fee of $80 to attend the workshop but Smith says there are some sponsorships available from Embrace and local businesses plus payment options for those who cannot pay the full amount immediately.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The workshop will be held at the New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy at Whanganui Airport on Saturday, March 30.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It starts at 9.30am with the sign-up process, which includes taking measurements and photos of the participants, and continues until 3.30pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For more information and to sign up for the workshop, go to Embrace Model Management's Facebook page.</p>
