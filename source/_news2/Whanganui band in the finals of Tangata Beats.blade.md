<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School Band The Remnant performed at this year's Smokefreerockquest and has qualified as one of 10 finalists to perform in the Tangata Beats section.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The band consists of Chester Nevil on drums, Joshua Waitai on keyboard, Wiremu Rogan on guitar and vocals and vocalists Cypress Kani-Hurinui and Tokararangi (Toka) Poa.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their original songs were written by Wiremu, Toka and Cypress with arrangements adapted by the rest of the band.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They had to have two original songs," says Whanganui High School Head of Music, Jeanette Jones. "In the Tangata Beats you have to have a cultural element. That can be Maori Pasifika language, style of music, dance, costume. It runs parallel with the Smokefreerockquest competition." Music must be original.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Remnant was put together for Rockquest.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Wiremu, Toka and I had been singing for about a year together. We do kapa haka," says Cypress.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We just jam together," says Toka.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They were highly encouraged to form a band for Rockquest," says Jeanette. It all seemed very casual.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"One day Cypress asked if I'd play in a band. I said yeah," says Joshua.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Toka, Wiremu and I wrote some songs first and then thought it would be cool if we had drums, and what about keys! Then it all came together," says Cypress.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band had been together for no more than a month before performing in Rockquest. One song was written a week before the performance.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We came up with a topic first," says Toka. "One of the things we wanted to do was make it positive, so instead of just talking about stuff we're going through, talk about how to get through it. The song was to be uplifting."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We wrote it down by the river at 10 o'clock at night," says Cypress.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The other song was written by Wiremu and arranged by the band. It is a very personal song about the passing of Wiremu's Koro.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While the others are in Year 13, Chester, on drums, is Year 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was in class and I got a note to go to (room) A8. "We need a drummer for Rockquest" and I was like, yeah, I'm down!"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The group agrees he's a very good drummer. Chester is one of the percussion group called The Buzz Rolls, who performed in the recent Chamber Music competitions. He is from Yakima, Washington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The finalists now prepare to play off at the Smokefree Tangata Beats national final at the Dorothy Winstone Centre in Auckland on Friday September 21, followed by the Smokefreerockquest final on Saturday September 22.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My whole family wants to come up with us to Auckland," says Cypress.<br />A contingent from school will accompany the group to the finals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"They're making history," says Jeanette. "We've had Rockquest finalists before but never in Tangata Beats."</strong></p>
