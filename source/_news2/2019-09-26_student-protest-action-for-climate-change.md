Dear Parents/Caregivers

Re: Student Protest Action for Climate Change

There will be student protest action throughout New Zealand on Friday, 27 September regarding climate change issues.

As you have conversations with your son or daughter regarding their attendance at school tomorrow or their possible participation in the student protest action, I would like you to be aware of the following information as part of your decision-making process - 

1. All timetabled classes will be running as normal on Friday.

2. Students who have parental permission to attend protest activities will be recorded as 'Explained Absence' (E) on our student attendance system (KAMAR). Please notify our Student Centre (3490177) if this is the case.

3. Students who do not have parental permission to attend protest activities will be recorded as 'Truant' (T) from classes on our student attendance system.


Kind regards
