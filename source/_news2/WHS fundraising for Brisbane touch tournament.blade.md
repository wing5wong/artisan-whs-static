<p class="element element-paragraph">When the Whanganui High School touch team goes to Brisbane in October the students will compete in the largest international touch tournament in the world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Queensland All Schools Touch Football Championships run from October 10 to October 15 and will feature a whopping 425 teams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's team of 15 girls will be the first from the school to compete at the tournament and it is going to take hard work both on and off the field to get there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Team manager Fiona Bryant said that fundraising efforts are under way.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"We have the Dave Upfold show as a fundraiser, it's going to be held at Whanganui High School on Thursday and Friday, the 24th and 25th of May," Bryant said. "It's a good show, a real laugh."</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Dave Upfold Show is a comedic hypnotist show, tickets cost $20 and can be purchased at the school, from the players or on eventfinda.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bryant said the cost of the Brisbane experience would be approximately $3000 per player.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've put the event out there amongst the community. It would be good to get some social clubs and stuff to come on board," Bryant said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There are 400 seats available in total. We're just about at the halfway mark already, but I'd like it to be over that point."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Bryant said that coach Sean Brown had tried to pull off a trip to Brisbane before, but things did not end up going to plan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"These girls came on board a couple of years ago and we thought 'Well, this is a good campaign for them because they're a young team' so we're giving it another go," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Most of them have crossed over into winter sport now, but they're combining their training with touch twice a week."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The team has further fundraising plans following the Dave Upfold Show.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"On the 1st of September we've got a casino night, tickets are $20 which will provide people with chips to play casino games and win prizes throughout the night," Bryant said.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"There will be an auction at the end, the bar will be open and it's just going to be a fun night."</strong></p>
