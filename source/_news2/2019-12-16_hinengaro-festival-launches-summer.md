The start of summer will feature a new youth-focused festival in Whanganui’s town centre. Whanganui District Council’s Youth Committee is working with other local agencies to hold the Hinengaro Rangatahi Festival at Majestic Square in Victoria Avenue this Friday, 13 December 2019 from 4.00pm until about 8.00pm.

The Council’s Youth Committee Project Support Officer, Nicole Grey, says, “One of the Youth Committee’s key tasks is to improve the wellbeing of young people in our area by giving them more opportunities to get involved. Hinengaro will appeal to a broad range of young people because it offers a diverse mix in the way of music and activities.” 

The festival will include a basketball competition, games, art and interactive hauora activities, food deals at Mint and Little C, prize giveaways, hip-hop dance crew, Aotea Empire, and music from local bands **Ocean Loaf**, City College Band, **Ra Costello, Rhythm Vision, In Business and DRXNES.**
