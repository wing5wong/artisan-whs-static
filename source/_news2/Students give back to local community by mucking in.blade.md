<p><span>READY CREW: James Shelby took a short barrow break at Riverland before the Whanganui High School team got to work on the clean-up.</span></p>
<p>Whanganui High School students were out in force yesterday volunteering their time to help out in the community doing everything from helping at Riding for the Disabled to cleaning up at Riverland Family Park.</p>
<p>Assistant principal Darren Torrie said it was a good way for students to learn more about what goes on in Whanganui and realise that "everything is not about them".</p>
<p>The school consulted Whanganui Volunteer Centre to find the best placements for students and they were spread around Castlecliff Coast Care, St John Ambulance, the Waimarie Riverboat Centre, Community House and 50 students worked with the Department of Conservation.</p>
<p>Mr Torrie said it was great to be able to help Riverland as owners Michael and Caryn Wilson are part of the WHS family with daughters Jessica and Natasha attending the school.</p>
<p>"Natasha has just finished school this year and Jessica is helping Castlecliff Coast Care at the beach today," said Mr Wilson.</p>
<p>The family park in Anzac Parade has been closed since the June floods and the clean-up at the park has been delayed because of a dispute over the lease with Wanganui District Council and uncertainty about health and safety concerns.</p>
<p>Mr Wilson said he is happy to report that Whanganui's medical officer of health Patrick O'Connor has given the all clear to commence a proper clean-up at the park.</p>
<p>"It's great to have the kids here to make a good start on the clean-up and we are now hopeful that we will be able to open during the summer," he said.</p>
<p>"We were hoping that we might be able to open in December but we now have our sights set on January."</p>
<p>The Wilsons said they have had a very stressful time during the past few months but recent discussions with council staff have been "productive", they said.</p>
