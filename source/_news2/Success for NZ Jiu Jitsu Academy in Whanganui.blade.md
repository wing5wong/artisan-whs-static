<p><br />One of the instructors for the NZ Jiu Jitsu Academy in Whanganui recently participated in a multi-style Martial Arts competition in Taranaki. Sensei (or teacher), ex WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Mat Hanna</strong>, first fought a karate exponent on the agreed rules of Taekwondo. He then fought another opponent, also a karate expert on the agreed rules of Hapkido, which is an offshoot of Taekwondo both of which are forms of Korean Martial Arts whereas Jiu Jitsu is a Japa<span class="text_exposed_show">nese form of Martial Arts.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Sensei Mat won both bouts taking home a gold medal for both. He competes in the heavy black belt division which is for those over 80kgs.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The irony is that NZ Jiu Jitsu is normally a non-competitive sport but as Damian Takarangi, who has been practising this form of Martial Arts for 20 years says, &ldquo;We are open to learning from other people and different styles.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Damian, who is a third degree Black Belt and also an instructor at the academy says, &ldquo;We have classes six nights a week at 69F Taupo Quay, next to the locksmiths.&rdquo; Currently over 100 students, of all ages and both genders, attend. The Toa class is for children five years to eight, juniors are from eight to 12, colts are from 12 to 18 and then there are the seniors.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">They also have other specialist programmes such as women&rsquo;s self-defence, security programmes and classes for beginners. Damian explains, Jiu Jitsu is full contact but kids wear protection. The focus though is on self-defence. We have a badge system which awards the kids for their involvement, skill and discipline.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The head instructor is Sensei, Shanon Casson, who is a 4th degree Black Belt, the only one of this rating in New Zealand.<br /></span></p>
