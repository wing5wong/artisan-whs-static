Our WHS Rugby boys were part of a 23 man Wanganui squad coached by 1st XV coach Mike Lama that competed at the Hurricanes Youth Rugby Council U16 rugby tournament held in Gisborne. 

Wanganui was captained by WHS student AJ Malili Malo Lauano who led well throughout the 4 day tournament. 

Results didn’t go our way but we competed well against the bigger provincial unions and never gave up.

Wanganui came 4th out of 6 teams. 💛🏉💚
