<p>Once again the talented people of Wanganui Arts Society &mdash; members and contributing artists &mdash; have filled Cooks Gallery with more than 60 artworks for Whanganui Artists Open Studios.</p>
<p>The first thing you'll notice is the variety: landscapes, flora and fauna, studies, prints, portraits, wet and dry media such as oils, acrylics, watercolours, pastels, pencils and tapestry work. And it's all for sale.</p>
<p>Cooks Gallery is behind Wanganui Motors off Ridgway St and will be open through Open Studios days from 10am till 4pm, and also Mondays and Tuesdays from 10am till midday.</p>
<p>Over the weekend there will be artists working in the gallery.</p>
<p>"It should be very welcoming," says Judy Webby, Arts Society committee member. Judy's own large landscapes are on display.</p>
<p>One of the younger artists is Stephanie Lockwood, who learned her artistic skills through Rei Hendry's Art House while at school. She exhibited at Cooks Gallery with supporting artist and schoolfriend Daisy Wilkie a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>"She's at uni now: she's extremely talented," says Judy.</p>
