<p class="element element-paragraph">New record, new line-up, new name and a North Island tour - 2018 is shaping up as a breakthrough year for Drxnes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It should be a pretty massive year ahead," drummer Ethan Coleman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui band, formerly known as Drones (pronounced the same way), formed in 2015 and have just released debut EP&nbsp;<em>Home</em>&nbsp;which has them on a six-date tour of the country.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We have already played in Wellington at the San Fran Bathhouse to a energetic and packed venue," Coleman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was an incredible experience to be playing on the same stage as some of our favorite international bands."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To go along with the EP release, Drxnes have dedicated their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIGcaxAvWjw" target="_blank">latest music video</a>&nbsp;for the single&nbsp;<em>Metanoia</em>&nbsp;to 'Jake the Snake', the 24-year-old Whanganui rugby player who died suddenly last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were all pretty good friends with him," Coleman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Part of the video was filmed at a live concert at Frank Bar where they will play again on March 24 for the penultimate leg of the tour.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Rob Reynolds has joined the line-up to add vocals to the band's sound.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He just blew us away. He's proven to be an asset to our music," Coleman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Home</em>&nbsp;is now available to listen to on YouTube, iTunes and Spotify.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">You can follow the band on on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DRXNESOFFICIAL/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;by searching Drxnes in the search bar.</p>
