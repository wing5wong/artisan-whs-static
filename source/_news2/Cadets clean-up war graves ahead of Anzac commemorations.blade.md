<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />They may be long gone, and some have no living descendants in Whanganui, but thanks to a group of local youth, their graves are well tended.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui air, sea and army cadets have been cleaning headstones on servicemen and women's graves in the lead-up to Anzac day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is something they do every year and air cadet Brandon Kidd said they discovered some previously untended graves at Heads Rd Cemetery on Friday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They are really old and date back to the 1850s, during the New Zealand Land Wars.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was quite hard to read the inscriptions but they are soldiers' graves."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Air Training Corps Squadron Leader <strong>Charlie Quirk </strong>(ex WHS student)&nbsp;said Veterans Affairs was struggling to maintain New Zealand war graves and asked for support from cadets in 2013.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The graves of servicemen and women who died in overseas conflicts are classed as 'true war graves' but there are also some who died in New Zealand from wounds inflicted overseas."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"True" war graves are the graves of serving members of the forces who died between certain dates.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For World War I it is between August 3, 1914, and August 31, 1921. For World War II it is between September 3, 1939, and December 31, 1947.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We include some that don't meet the terms of the classification and cadets discover new graves each year," said Quirk.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The cadets had to work very hard the first time they cleaned the graves because some had been neglected for a long time."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After heavy build-ups of lichen and moss have been cleared, it becomes a matter of maintenance and some century-old graves at Aramoho Cemetery looked almost new after being cleaned on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cadet <strong>Georgia Hiscotte</strong> discovered a new World War I grave while cleaning others nearby.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The inscription is very faded but when I looked closely, I saw that the person served in the First World War."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Quirk said some of the graves discovered by cadets this year will be added to the future cleaning schedule.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He says cadets will be assisting the RSA with their Poppy Day Appeal on Saturday, April 20, laying poppies on graves at Aramoho Cemetery on April 24 and will be attending Anzac Day parades throughout the Whanganui region on April 25.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The New Zealand Cadet Forces (NZCF or Cadet Forces) is a voluntary military-style training organisation for New Zealand youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Youth are usually eligible to join one of three Corps - Sea Cadet Corps (SCC), the New Zealand Cadet Corps (NZCC) and the Air Training Corps (ATC) when they start high school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brandon Kidd</strong>, 18, joined ATC as a 12-year-old and says he wants to become a commercial pilot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is really good training for life and we do a lot of fun things as well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Some young people don't like being told what to do but it is a brilliant opportunity which I highly recommend."</p>
