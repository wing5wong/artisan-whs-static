<p class="element element-paragraph">Episode four of&nbsp;<em>Project Runway NZ</em>&nbsp;was a walk in the park for Whanganui contestant (and former WHS student) Kerry Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After winning the episode three challenge, he had immunity from elimination so the pressure was off.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just enjoyed myself with that one," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerry is visiting his hometown this week to celebrate with his mum Cathy Ranginui who has just retired from 32 years of nursing at Whanganui Hospital.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've taken breaks that add up to about eight years when I had my three children," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Asked if she is proud of her designer son, Cathy said all three of her children make her proud.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerry's older brother Kahu is a soldier currently serving in Iraq and sister Tracey is an insurance broker and mum to sons Finley 12, and Darcy 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Darcy reckons it is "awesome" to watch his uncle on TV each week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't get to see them as often as I would like to so it's good to know I'm in their lives via the TV screen'" says Kerry.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tracey and husband Joshua Hill live on a lifestyle block in Palmerston Nth where they have developed 5 acres of gardens.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That is my retirement plan," says Cathy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm going to work in my garden, help Tracey with hers and I have hundreds of roses to plant."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Her husband Stuart has already retired and the family provide a rural welcome for Auckland-based Kerry when his busy schedule allows for visits home.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Kerry can stroll around our place in his Karen Walker gumboots," says Tracey.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She is proud of her little brother who did a few hard years in Auckland before landing work as a pattern maker for Karen Walker.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While Kerry had an easy time on Project Runway this week, Whanganui's contestant on the&nbsp;<em>Great NZ Bake Off</em>&nbsp;missed the mark.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Clayton Barnett was on a creative roll after producing his Kowhai Park dinosaur slide cake on episode one, he made a pineapple upside-down cake with a tropical scene and a rhubarb slice cut in rounds rather than squares this week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although the judges pronounced his efforts well-baked and delicious, they said he failed to make the brief on both counts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'd never made a pineapple upside-down cake before - at least I gave it a twist," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I now know that wasn't a slice but they liked the taste and that's what counts to me.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I live to fight another day."</p>
