<p><strong>Central RPC</strong></p>
<p>The Central Rowing Performance Centre is part of Rowing New Zealand&rsquo;s High Performance Programme which is about helping talented young rowers from school and club teams become elite athletes rowing for their country.</p>
<p>The core purpose of the High Performance Programme is the delivery of distinguished performances at the Olympic Games and World Championships, Senior, U23, Junior and other international competitions including U21.</p>
<p>Central RPC provides the infrastructure needed to help aspiring young rowers reach the top. This includes training by our world class coaches and the use of outstanding facilities and superb rowing waters. Health and nutrition are also carefully monitored by our professional support team and, although the focus is on rowing, education and vocational careers are not neglected. Links to tertiary institutions and local employment markets ensure there are study and employment opportunities for those who want them.</p>
<p>The Central RPC region covers the top of the south - Nelson and Marlborough, and lower north island with &ndash; Wellington, Horowhenua, Palmerston North, Wanganui and Taranaki.</p>
