Local performers will join two headline acts on the Majestic Square stage for today’s Whanganui Festival of Cultures performances.

The line-up includes the IPU New Zealand Kodama Japanese Drum Team and Aro, a duo that blends stories in popr’n’b style songs to express the people, the culture and the land of Aotearoa.

A wide range of local performers will join the fun for the day-long, family-friendly event.

The festival has attracted more stallholders this year, with a record 28 signed up to provide ethnic cuisine from around the world.

There will be food from, among others, South Africa, the Middle East, Korea, the Pacific, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, South America, along with some Kiwi favourites, including a traditional hangi and good old hotdog on a stick.

“The Festival of Cultures is a chance for people of all cultures, backgrounds, ages and interests to come together in the heart of our beautiful city, to share food, conversation, engage with one another all whilst having a good time,” Mainstreet Whanganui events manager Kelly Scarrow said.

“The Festival of Cultures is organised by the community for the community to reflect and celebrate our cultural diversity within our city. These types of events are what community is all about.”

It is the ninth consecutive year of the festival, which gets under way at 10am at Majestic Square.
