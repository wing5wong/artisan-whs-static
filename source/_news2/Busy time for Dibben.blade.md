<p>Whanganui's Richie Dibben is making a name for himself overseas and, with extra support from within the Kiwi motorcycling community, he should continue to do so in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Perhaps considered one of the most talented, albeit also one of the unluckiest, super motard bike riders that New Zealand has produced, the 27-year-old Dibben jumped at the opportunity this year to race in the FIM Asian Supermoto Championships this season.</p>
<p>He has contested the first three rounds in series - in Australia, Indonesia and the Philippines - and he managed a mixed bag of results.</p>
<p>Yesterday he headed away to race at the fourth and final round in Malaysia.<br />Motorcycling New Zealand, the governing body for the sport here, is the latest to offer financial assistance to Dibben, offering $1000 to help see him on his way to Malaysia.</p>
<p>"I can't believe how much bad luck I've had in the series so far and, after being ranked second overall after round one, I'm now back in sixth position (in a field of about 30 riders from the UK, Australia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia)," said the Whanganui bike mechanic.</p>
<p>"I took my bike with me, stripped down and packed into five suitcases, for the Australian round.</p>
<p>"I finished third in the first race in Australia, beaten by former Australian motocross champion Luke George, but was then disqualified in race two when I was adjudged to have not re-entered the course at the point I'd left it ... and that was after I'd been smashed into by another rider.</p>
<p>"I won both races in the Indonesian round and then had bad luck again in the Philippines round when I crashed during warm-up and blew a hole in my engine case. It was a nightmare really.</p>
<p>"After the Australian round I had bikes supplied for me and, while they were okay, they weren't the best. They didn't have a slipper clutch and so I felt a little disadvantaged with the gear I had."</p>
<p>With a Give-A-Little internet page raising $3800 and another $3000 coming from other sponsors, the cheque from MNZ helps make the Malaysian trip possible.</p>
<p>"We'll have to wait and see what happens, but I'd like to do the whole series again next year."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dibben returns home from Malaysia next Tuesday to ready himself for Boxing Day.</p>
<p>The two-time winner of the Suzuki Super Motard title, was unbeatable at Manfeild on Sunday.</p>
<p>However, he is in the unenviable position of having to play catch-up in the Suzuki Series points after he failed to finish one of his two races at Taupo a week earlier because of mechanical failure. Dibben has clearly been the fastest rider in the class but, once again, luck has deserted him so far this year.</p>
<p>He lanquishes in third place on the leaderboard with 64.5 points behind defending champion Duncan Hart from Tauranga (80pts) and second placed Ashton Hughes from Bulls on 68pts.</p>
<p>Dibben needs Hart to have an off day on the Cemetery Circuit to stand any chance of claiming the title for a third time.</p>
