On the last day of Term 3, Whanganui High School students Callista Booth-Richards and Jayden Grant organised and ran this Litter Free Lunch day with the student council at Whanganui High School.  A sausage sizzle was held for the students who packed a rubbish free lunch, and a variety of reusable lunch containers, sandwich bags and honey wraps were handed out, supplied by the Whanganui Resource Recovery Centre (WRRC).  Callista and Jayden also gave assembly presentations during the week to educate the students about more sustainable lunch alternatives.

The following is a portion of WRRC newsletter of Term 4:

Litter Free Lunch Day was held again during Term three. Thirteen schools took part, we had a great response from all involved and loved hearing how each school ran their day. This year we had two secondary schools take part in the day; Whanganui Girls College and **Whanganui High School**. Both schools did a great job tying this into the climate change strike and promoting the day within their school.  We had a number of schools visit us throughout the term to learn more about litter free lunches. There were picnics, shared lunches, house competitions and sausage sizzles. A big thank you to the Whanganui District Council, our sponsors and all the students and staff who embraced the day. 

Comvita also came and ran a free afternoon workshop on how to make a honey wrap for some lucky followers of our Facebook page. 

If your school is interested in learning more about litter free lunches then book in for a visit or contact us for more information.
