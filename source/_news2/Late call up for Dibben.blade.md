<p>AUSSIE BOUND: Whanganui racer Richard Dibben (former WHS student) gained a late call up to represent New Zealand in the Asia Supermoto Championship around the streets of Newcastle this weekend.</p>
<p>Two-time Suzuki Series motard champ Richard Dibben has sneaked into a field of international riders racing in the Asia Supermoto Championships in Australia this weekend.</p>
<p>The Whanganui motorcycle mechanic received a late call up last week after current Suzuki Series motard titleholder Duncan Hart from Tauranga broke his collarbone.</p>
<p>Dibben was named to take Hart's spot in the field to race around the tight streets and carparks of Newcastle on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Dibben immediately dismantled his Honda CRF450 and packed it into five wooden crates for the flight to Newcastle later today.</p>
<p>While he has not raced on roads since the Paeroa street race in February, Dibben did swap his slicks for nobblies to compete in club off-road dirt races through winter.</p>
<p>However, he is not concerned about a lack of match fitness on sealed roads and in fact subscribes to the adage "it's just like riding a bike".</p>
<p>"I should be okay," Dibben said yesterday.</p>
<p>"I have been racing, just not on roads. I only found out about the Newcastle meeting late last week after Duncan rang to say he'd broken his collarbone. They managed to swap his name for mine, so I'm off with the bike to Australia."</p>
<p>Dibben said it would only take a few hours to put his bike back together and he was looking forward to competing again on a street circuit.</p>
<p>Of course he is no stranger to street racing with the final leg of the Suzuki Series raced on the Cemetery Circuit here in his hometown every Boxing Day. He also has experience on the Paeroa and Nelson streets.</p>
<p>"I have yet to race in Newcastle, but I think it's much tighter then the Cemetery Circuit and a bit more like Nelson. I understand it's in and out of carparks and on the streets as well, but I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>"I don't know many of the riders racing this weekend, but it doesn't matter, I'll just hop on and ride my own race - hopefully that'll be enough," Dibben said.</p>
<p>The Newcastle track may actually suit Dibben simply because it is a mix of road and off-road surfaces and features traditional supermoto table tops.</p>
<p>Dibben will have his own support crew with mum, Gailene, dad Chris, brother Michael and girlfriend Mikaela Healy also going along for the ride.</p>
