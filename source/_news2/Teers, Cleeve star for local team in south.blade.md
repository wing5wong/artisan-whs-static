<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Speed Skating team ventured south to Timaru last weekend to take on the might of the South Canterbury club on their home turf in the NZ Banked Track National Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>In the Senior Women's grade, former WHS student Monique Cleeve continued her winning form from the Road Nationals with wins in the 300TT, 1000m and 500m.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>She also picked up a bronze in the 10km Open Ladies Elimination race.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Spokesman Ken Smith said Renee Teers also had a return to form after a disappointing Road and Track Nationals in the ultra competitive Intermediate Women's grade, which saw a different winner in each of the specialist races.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>"Teer's was runner</strong> up to South Canterbury's Ella Benson <strong>in the 300 Time Trial</strong> and to Charlotte Clarke (South Canterbury)<strong> in the 1000m, before charging to a convincing win in the 500m."</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>WHS student, Teers also took silver in the 10km points elimination behind Clarke.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Junior Boys grade, South Canterbury's Kaylum McAuley was too big and strong for the younger Whanganui star duo of Chase Morpeth and Drew Brennan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>However, WHS student Morpeth</strong> and Brennan<strong> took all the respective silver and bronze medals and "look set to dominate the grade next year", said Smith.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tazia Parker showed she is a rising star in her first full season of competition with a string of silver medals in the heavily contested Juvenile Girls events, always chasing home Nelson's Mikaela MacDonald.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's Keira Brennan joined her on the podium with a brave third in the 3000m.<br />In the Masters events, Krystine Davies was untouchable in all her races and Whanganui's Crystle Denbee was second.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Paul Cleeve had a good second place in the Masters Men's 300TT and was third in both the 500m and 5km Points.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Hadleigh Smith continued to show the promise he displayed at Road and Track Nationals with a string of seconds in the Primary Boys.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui club teams took silver in the Senior Women's and Junior Boys relays, while the team of Tazia Parker, Victoria Smith and Keira Brennan got bronze in the Junior Girls.</p>
