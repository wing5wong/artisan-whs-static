<p class="element element-paragraph">Rebecca Benge has been riding horses since she was knee-high to a grasshopper.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 18-year-old's grandfather broke horses in as a trainer, her mother rode them and so did her sister.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Benge, a mounted games competitor who has won a multitude of national titles, recently returned to Whanganui High School after competing in Belgium.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She participated in the International Mounted Games Association's 33rd World Team Championship Open, where the competition was tough, she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The result wasn't what we wanted going into it, we got 14th out of 25 teams, so it wasn't bad, but I think we had high hopes for ourselves going over there," Benge said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What let the team down was a few issues with riders and horses not quite gelling as well as we had hoped."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Benge represented New Zealand in a team of six that included Jamie Egging, Shayla Shaw, Sky Notter, Amie Bentall and reserve Nicole Hope.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They competed on borrowed mounts as the cost to transport their horses to Europe was too high.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Riding random mounts made things a lot harder, Benge said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was just tougher than we thought it was going to be. For a lot of us it was our first major international competition, so that probably played a part in it as well.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But I was pretty happy with what I did, there were a few moments where I let myself down, but on the whole," Benge said, "it was a pretty clean performance."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mounted games is a branch of equestrian sport featuring individuals, pairs and teams competing in events such as bottle swap, jousting and mug shuffle.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Benge's favourite is socks and buckets, which is a vaulting game.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Vaulting gives me an adrenaline rush and I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie, it's quite a high-paced game as well and I like speed," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've always been quite good at it and I'm quite a competitive person &ndash; I like to win."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Last season was a good one for Benge and she needed it after missing out on making a world team the year before.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was very hard for me, you always want to be in those teams, so when I didn't make the cut, I went back and had to train harder," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I worked my ass off to get back up to where I wanted to be."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The main thing holding her back was her mentality, she would find herself getting scared when entering the ring.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've always been a talented rider, but in the pressure situations, I kind of cracked and let myself down," Benge said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had to change that thought of 'oh no, it's Nationals' to something positive like 'yes, it's Nationals, I finally get the chance to do this' because you want to be under pressure &mdash; that's your chance to prove that you're the best."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In her final year of school, Benge has a clear idea of what is to come.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Going to Belgium definitely made me see how much I want to be at the top of the sport, when I leave school I intend to stay here and ride our New Zealand season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"As soon as our season's finished, I'll go over to the UK to do their season and just see what happens."</p>
