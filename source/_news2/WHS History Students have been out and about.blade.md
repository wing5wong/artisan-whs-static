<p>In the last few days senior History students have been busy! Last Thursday (14<sup>th</sup>) the Level 1 students did a walking tour of Whanganui and visited several monuments in the City. This is part of their assessment titled <strong>How we Remember</strong>. A highlight for many was the visit to the Alexander Research Library where students were able to look up family events from the archives.</p>
<p>Then on Monday 18<sup>th</sup> our Level 2 students and some keen L3 students took a trip to the National War Museum in Waiouru as part of their <strong>New Zealand at War</strong> assessment. The students were given a fascinating tour, and then were lucky enough to be able to use the Kippinberger Library which houses a large collection of resources on the topic of warfare. In this assessment students were given free choice of topics, and chose a wide variety of interesting and diverse events.</p>
<p>Both trips were excellent, and it was fantastic to spend time with a group of students who were eager to learn and keen to get stuck into resources that were not just downloaded from the internet. Both these assessments require students to find sources in support of their questions, and they certainly achieved that.</p>
<p>Well done everyone!&nbsp;</p>
