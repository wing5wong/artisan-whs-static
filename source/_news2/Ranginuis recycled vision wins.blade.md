<p class="element element-paragraph">Kerry Ranginui (former WHS student) looked anxious when he found himself in a technology recycling centre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We don't belong here," he told his fellow contestants on Monday night's episode of Project Runway NZ.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Contestants were faced with the challenge of making two garments that would incorporate items recovered from old electronics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was a daunting prospect because they had to be functional rather than wearable art," Ranginui said on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There was a further shock for the contestants when the show's mentor, Andreas Mikellis, told them they would have to work in pairs.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui's face lit up when he was told that he would be working with Auckland designer Judy Gao.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've got to know her and she comes across as sweet and demure but her designs are very sexy and classy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The pair got to work on dismantling an old piano keyboard and Ranginui lamented his lack of brute strength.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The problem is that neither of us is very strong and I'm quite unmanly when it comes to DIY," said Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nevertheless, he and Gao managed to extract plenty of small, shiny components they hand stitched onto a glamorous coat designed by Ranginui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The judges loved the coat and declared Ranginui the challenge winner.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were not so keen on Gao's satin jumpsuit worn underneath but were satisfied that she met the brief.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ranginui who has worked as a pattern maker for Karen Walker for eight years said he was very thankful to have his team mate's support for his design.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I have never done that much hand stitching and I had callouses on my fingers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Judy does a lot of beading work on her designs while as a pattern maker I am not usually involved in that part of the construction."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has been obvious during the first three episodes of Project Runway that Ranginui knows his way around a workroom better than some other contestants.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"People ask for help and I don't like to see anyone struggling so I was quite generous with my time at first.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I did start to resent it when I was busy with my own designs but if I had the time to spare it was okay."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nelson contestant Matt Costello was eliminated after he failed to impress judges with the top he designed to go with Beau Takapu's skirt.</p>
<p><span><span>Judge Benny Castles said the garment was "very Star Trek" and looked like something Lieutenant Uhura might wear to a corporate affair.</span></span></p>
