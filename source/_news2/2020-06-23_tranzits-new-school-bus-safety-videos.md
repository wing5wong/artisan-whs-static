Earlier this year, prior to lockdown, Tranzit Coachlines worked with our drivers to develop two videos about school bus safety and appropriate student behaviour on the school bus.  

We also wanted these videos to reassure parents and caregivers that the school bus is a safe way to travel to school and help eliminate any concerns they may have, especially when their child (who maybe as young as 5 years old) uses the bus for the first time.

On behalf of our drivers and our Health, Safety & Environmental Manager we hope you and your school community find these two videos useful.

The first video talks about a student’s first school bus journey (“Staying Cool on the School Bus”) and the second video is about appropriate student behaviour on the school (“Best Bus Behaviour”).
