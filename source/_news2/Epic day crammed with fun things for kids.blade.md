<p class="element element-paragraph">Bouncy castles, water-slides and face-painting - it was all go at Whanganui's Pukenamu Queens Park on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For the second consecutive year, the Whanganui District Library and Nga Tai o te Awa joined forces to organise a Children's Day for families to enjoy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Senior librarian Jane Barlow said there was a wonderful turnout and the weather was an added bonus.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's really about family fun and getting together as a whanau," Ms Barlow said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Children's Day was officially on March 4 but there were too many other events happening that day &mdash; "So we decided to hold ours later so people can make it along."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The day started bright and early at 7.30am and carried on until 2pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Six-year-old Waireti Hill was there getting her face painted with flowers by 13-year-old Cypris Hill.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Activities include the mobile library, bouncy castle, sausage sizzle, face painting, rock painting and a water-slide. Plunket Whanganui was there as was Wilbur, the dental van.</p>
