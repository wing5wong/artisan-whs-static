<p><br />On Friday 24&nbsp;May, WHS took 28 students to the Lower North Island Tough Guy/Gal competition held just out of Wellington.</p>
<p>There was a 6 km and 12 km course.&nbsp; Our students did the 12 km course.&nbsp; It was a tough course, which the students completed 2 laps of running up hills, through rivers, muddy swamps, up cargo nets and under electric fences.</p>
