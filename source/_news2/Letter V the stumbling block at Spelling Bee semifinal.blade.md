<p class="element element-paragraph">Paroxysm, chrysanthemum, witticism, tūrangawaewae, manaakitanga and whakamā.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The words have little in common, but many people, young or old, may consider them quite difficult to spell.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They were all included in a list of 50 words given to students competing in the lower North Island semifinal of the New Zealand Spelling Bee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui High School students Isaiah Tubayan and Christina Donne-Lee qualified for the competition and went to Wellington to do battle with the best.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Year 10 students gave a good account of themselves, but were eliminated in the same round, three rounds from the finish.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The letter V was the enemy on the day as Tubayan was taken out by the word veritable and Donne-Lee was tripped up by vapidity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I got eliminated, I just played it off like it was no big deal because almost all of the other spellers got eliminated as well and I wasn't the first," Tubayan said. "But I was pretty sad."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School students had not been competing in spelling bee competitions, but teacher Nick Staples introduced it to them as he had done at Heretaunga College.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To practise for the competition, Tubayan printed word lists off of the internet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I would give the spelling lists to my mother, she would say the words to me and then I would spell them," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The support I got meant a lot, most of my siblings are in the Phillipines, they'd call me at night and say 'Practise, practise'."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Donne-Lee said she was lured into giving the competition a crack by the $5000 prize.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"No, it's good to try new things, that's why I gave it a go.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I got out, there were 16 competitors left. I think I did as well as I could have done and the word that I got out on wasn't a word I had ever heard before."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said that it was a good competition, but due to the random nature of the words drawn, some students got very easy words to spell and others were much more difficult.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Donne-Lee said she would prefer it if all of the competitors had the same word read out to them which they would write down on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Instead, students are called onto a stage and have a word read out to them which they can have used in a sentence to help them with the spelling of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's good because you learn new words and because you have to go up on a stage to read out the spelling of the word, it's a bit like public speaking too," Donne-Lee said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I got eliminated I was thinking 'Well, that could have gone better' but it was very good for my confidence."</p>
