<p><span>Siblings,&nbsp;<span>Michael and Lucy Dowman (past/present WHS students),</span> to fight it out in Suzuki Series.</span></p>
<p><span>The Suzuki Gixxer 150 class in this year&rsquo;s Suzuki Series will be one for locals to watch, with six of the 17 confirmed riders hailing from the River City.</span></p>
<p><span>Two of the new crop of Gixxer racers are siblings, Michael and Lucy Dowman. Neither of these youngsters are strangers to motorsport, with Michael regularly competing on a side-chair over the past coupl</span><span class="text_exposed_show">e of years and sister Lucy, an experienced side-chair swinger. However, it will the first time competing on two wheels for either of the Dowmans.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Dowmans took their new bikes to Ruapuna race track in Christchurch recently, and competed well in a class dominated by larger-engined bikes. Both enjoyed the experience and are looking forward to a strong result in the Suzuki Series, which kicked off in Taupo on December 9. Expect these two to ride the wheels off their bikes!<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Other riders from Wanganui new to the class are 14 year-old Luca Durning, and 15 year-old Caleb Gilmore. Neither of these lads have road bike experience, but Caleb has previously raced Motocross.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">They will join locals, Hunter Stoneman-Boyle, and Cameron Goldfinch, both of whom competed in the Gixxer Cup last season. Watch out for these two, as with more experience gained from last year, they are expected to be at the pointy-end of this year&rsquo;s field.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Gixxer Cup is open to riders aged 14 to 20 years old, who have not previously finished in a top-five position in a national motorcycle racing class. The class is based on identical Suzuki GSX150s prepared in Suzuki New Zealand&rsquo;s workshop by New Zealand Superbike champion, Sloan Frost. Changes from the road version are limited to removing indicators and side-stand, fitting a race exhaust and fitting Dunlop AL14 tyres, which are the control tyre for the series. New race bikes are available for just $4,995, ready to race.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The production racing class &ndash; with the tagline "Growing Future Champions" &ndash; was created to provide a springboard for young riders towards a successful racing future at higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The road version of the fully faired Gixxer 150 retails for $3,495 ride away.</span></p>
