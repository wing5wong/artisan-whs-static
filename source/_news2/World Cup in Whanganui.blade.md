<p><span><strong>PRECIOUS METAL: Black Ferns Sosoli Talawadua (nee Tofa - former WHS student) and Toka Natua came to Whanganui with precious metal.</strong> <br /><em>PHOTO / Lewis Gardner</em></span><strong></strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Being six and half months pregnant didn't stop world champ Black Fern Sosoli Talawadua from giving it her all in Whanganui's River Raft Race on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Talawadua returned to her hometown with Black Fern teammate Toka Natua to be auctioned off at Whanganui's annual charity event and lend their strength to a team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The&nbsp;<em>Chronicle</em>&nbsp;caught up with Talawadua over the weekend and it wasn't until the end of the interview she revealed she was in her third trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She is not playing rugby at the moment but said a raft race was no sweat ... or at least those were her initial thoughts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The race started in line with the Wanganui Motorboat Club and I saw the big duck just passed the Dublin bridge and I just assumed the race finished there but it went all the way to Putiki so that was a bit of a shock midway through the race."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But despite the disruption in her mental game, Talawadua said it was a lot of fun and she was glad to be a part of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She was part of the raft team put together by her father, Whanganui boxing gym manager Eddie Tofa.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They only entered their team Friday night, made the raft that night in two hours, and hadn't even checked to see if it would float.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But we got there and it didn't sink or break ... it was just loads of fun," Talawadua said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She and fellow NZ prop Natua were at Kowhai Park for the pre-race gala with the women's Rugby World Cup trophy, won by the Black Ferns 41-32 in an epic final against England in Belfast in August.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Talawadua said as soon as they set the cup up they had kids coming over congratulating them and thanking them for coming.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was really cool to see and everyone was really welcoming."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There were a lot of rules that came with bringing the World Cup to Whanganui but they'd had no problems.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had my brother, who's a boxer, with me so that helped secure it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Talawadua said looking back at last year's win against England came with a mix of emotions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Black Ferns were down 17-5 at half time, but she aid everyone was really calm and they just reflected on what the win meant to them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I thought the coaches were going to give us an earful but they were calm and so were the players and our whole theme had been about family &mdash; and we just went back out there and did it for our families."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The former Whanganui High School student left her home town five years ago, heading to Hamilton in her bid to become a Black Fern.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She is back in Whanganui about twice a year &mdash; or whenever parents Eddie and Sandra Tofa hold a boxing event.</p>
