Whanganui's Seth Reardon now has a 23 point lead on top of the 2019 New Zealand Enduro Championships after coming runnerup to the fifth different winner in Bideford, Masterton on Saturday.</p>
<p>Rotorua's Bradley Lauder claimed the top spot on the demanding farmland course, the fifth round of seven in the Yamaha and Mitas Tyres-sponsored series, and with that he has elevated himself from ninth to third equal overall in the title chase.</p>
<p>Helensville's Tom Buxton won Round 1 of the series near Whangamata in March, Cambridge rider Dylan Yearbury clinched his win at Round 2 near Porirua in April, Thames rider Chris Birch topped the podium at Round 3 near Tokoroa two weeks later and then Reardon won Round 4 near Martinborough three weeks ago.</p>
<p>After Lauder and Reardon, Wainuiomata's Jake Whitaker finished third on Saturday, while Cambridge's Beau Taylor and Tokoroa's Jake Wightman rounded out the top five.</p>
<p>Lauder won four of the day's five high-speed "special tests", and ended the full day's racing 1m 14s ahead of Reardon, while Whitaker finished his day 53s further back.</p>
<p>Whitaker is now level with Lauder at third overall in the series standings, representing a great improvement for Whitaker, who had been ranked seventh overall after Round 4.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Lauder took a cautious approach to his racing on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The course was a mix of open farmland, with some pine tree sections too, and I was on minute one, among the first riders to be sent onto the track.</p>
<p>"I thought I'd be cunning and let the other two riders with me go ahead, so that I'd have wheel tracks to follow and it worked out for me."</p>
<p>Reardon currently holds the ace cards in terms of overall championship glory &ndash; he is leading the standings after five rounds and the rider immediately behind him, Waikato's Taylor, is a massive 23 points adrift.</p>
<p>Reardon will be hoping he can hang on to the lead when the competitors next race, at the double-header final weekend, Rounds 6-7, in Hokitika in three weeks' time, on July 19-20.</p>
<p>With the scores from only six of the seven rounds to be counted &ndash; riders to discard their one worst result &ndash; the race for the championship win outright, and for the various class titles too, could still go down to the wire at Hokitika.</p>
