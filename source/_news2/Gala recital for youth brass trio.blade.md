<p class="element element-paragraph">Brass Whanganui is celebrating the inclusion of three of its members in the National Youth Brass Band of New Zealand with a gala recital at Sarjeant on the Quay.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The recital is today (Saturday, August 25), is to help raise funds for Sarah Wright, Ethan Mancer and Jacob Mancer to travel to Australia on the youth band's tour at the end of the year. Each band member has to raise $2000 for the trip.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There will be a brass ensemble of 12 from Brass Whanganui, most of them ex-members of the National Youth Brass Band," Brass Whanganui musical director Bruce Jellyman said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They will be accompanied by <strong>Joanna Love</strong> (WHS teacher) on piano. The three youth members will be doing some solo work, accompanied by Brass Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's great for them and we really want to support them. David Bremner is the director of the Youth Brass Band and this will be his last tour of duty. He's a really amazing guy who works spectacularly well with youth. They will love to play in his band."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Sarah, who is a Whanganui High School student, is the current New Zealand junior cornet champion while fellow High School student Ethan, who plays the euphonium, was fourth in the junior nationals. Jacob (tenor horn) is a member of the New Zealand Army Band.</strong></p>
