Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) Band member, **Corporal Brad Mancer**, is promising great things at Whanganui Opera House later this month, when he returns to his home town as part of the band’s annual tour.

This year the Air Force on Tour will feature a range of music from Drax Project to Dizzy Gillespie and Puccini and John Williams. Solos from Flight Sergeant Murray Mansfield, special guest, Private Bryony Williams and the band’s Drumline will be sure to impress.

The 65-member band is made up of New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) Reservists, many of whom are active in Wellington’s music scene.

**Corporal Mancer**, who plays in the trumpet section, said that being a part of the band had allowed him to travel all over the world and perform in incredible venues. That included the iconic Whanganui Opera House.

“I am really looking forward to performing in Whanganui. I always love coming home and performing to the people I grew up with,” he said.

**Corporal Mancer**, who is a graphic designer, joined the band in April 2013, after moving to Wellington to study design at Massey University.

A highlight was travelling to Gallipoli to play the Last Post at Anzac Day commemorations in April 2018.

“It was a great honour to travel to Gallipoli, represent my country and honour the fallen through playing the Last Post,” Corporal Mancer said.

When not busy practising and performing with the RNZAF Band, **Corporal Mancer** also performs with Australasian champion Wellington Brass and works as a graphic designer at PikPok Games.

The Air Force on Tour will be held in the Whanganui Opera House on Friday, 28 February, at 7pm. Tickets from whanganuivenues.co.nz.
