<p>Two local high school students are enjoying the time of their lives in Wellington this week thanks to the Whanganui Jazz Club.</p>
<p><span><strong>David Marks of Whanganui High School</strong> and&nbsp;</span>Liam Boswell of Cullinane College&nbsp; are attending the Summer Jazz Program offered by the New Zealand Jazz Foundation. The weeklong workshop is held on the campus of the New Zealand School of Music at Victoria University of Wellington. Participants are all students under 1<span class="text_exposed_show">9 years of age and come from far and wide to experience the many benefits to be gained from the study of this demanding art form. As well as tuition from some of the country&rsquo;s top jazz educators, this summer&rsquo;s workshop features the celebrated American drummer and educator John Riley.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Liam is the jazz club&rsquo;s first &lsquo;youth ambassador&rsquo;, and his enthusiasm for the music and everything surrounding it is infectious. David came to the attention of the club when he participated in the recent workshop held at Collegiate.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">&ldquo;In the world of today, jazz music and education are inextricably bound together&rdquo; says Ken Chernoff, President of the Whanganui Jazz Club. &ldquo;In the early days of the music, the players would practice and play together incessantly to master and develop the complicated language of the idiom. Each would listen to performances of the most accomplished and strive to emulate them. The complex nature of American society pushed the musicians to outdo each other, and the music evolved rapidly. And as the music spread throughout the country, its success both commercially and as an art form, brought about formal education facilities in high schools, colleges and universities.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Jazz became arguably America&rsquo;s most notable export, and the music is now practiced and studied throughout the world. Here in New Zealand, degree courses are available in Wellington and Auckland, and many high schools offer opportunities for young aspiring players. Our Jazz Club in Whanganui is proud of the efforts we make to encourage young people to develop their talents.&rdquo;</span></p>
