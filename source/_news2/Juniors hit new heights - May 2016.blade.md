<p>FLYING HIGH: Wanganui Junior Academy rider <strong>Tom Gilligan</strong> (WHS student) takes a leap of faith At the Mighty Manawatu Junior Motocross Champs near Foxton on Sunday.</p>
<p>THE newly formed Balance Chartered Accountants Junior Wanganui Motocross Academy is driving young riders to new levels.</p>
<p>Academy manager Ant Rountree said it was launched earlier this year to help improve the technique and performance of young riders in the Wanganui Motorcycle Club's off-road competitions.</p>
<p>"The academy was started this year when 30 local businesses got on board paying $50 each to go into a draw for the naming rights. That was won by Balance," Rountree said.</p>
<p>"That helped raise $4500 which is being used over the year for professional coaching and trips away. After the first two-day coaching clinic held last school holidays, each rider has improved a lot and is getting faster by the week."</p>
<p>Last Sunday, academy riders competed at the Mighty Manawatu Junior Motocross Championships near Foxton at Himatangi where James Rountree (KX85) had the best result finishing sixth in the under-17 years 85cc class, followed by Campbell Tylee (RM85) in ninth overall and <strong>Jaxon Watt</strong> (KX85) a creditable 11th overall in the under-17 125cc class.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Tom Gilligan</strong> (YZ125) finished ninth overall in his grade finishing race three in sixth after a top ride.</p>
<p><strong>Olly Dennison </strong>Husqvarna (YZ125) was back from a broken leg to finish 11th overall, while <strong>Anton Montague</strong> (YZ125) ended the championship in 14th.</p>
<p>In the under-17 250cc class Hunter Gilbertson (YZF250) rode well to finish seventh overall in a very competitive class.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the under-13 year 85cc class Alex Luff-Scott (CR85) finished 12th.</p>
<p>Next event for the academy is round three of the Wanganui Motocross Championships on June 19.</p>
