<p><strong>WHS student Lionel Treweek (left)</strong>, Sue Laugesen and Rob McMillan with their medals from the <strong>NZ Nationals in Palmerston North</strong> last weekend.</p>
<p>It was the 26th national title for Marangai Archery Club founder Rob McMillan and the first medals for some of his club mates at the NZ National Championships in Palmerston North last weekend.</p>
<p>Five members of the club attended the championships, out of 180 archers in various divisions.</p>
<p>McMillan won gold in the Master compound on Saturday - his seventh indoor win in the last eight years - while also coming third in the match play on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gustav Bam was third in the senior men's compound and third in the match play.</p>
<p>Hanlie Bam came fifth in the senior women's compound, while missing out in the match play.</p>
<p>Sue Laugesen got bronze both on the Saturday in the women's recurve and in the match play on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lionel Treweek came fifth in the junior boy's recurve and won the bronze in the match play.</p>
<p>It was the first tournament for Laugesen and Treweek.</p>
<p>McMillan has now had 43 wins out of 45 tournaments in the last three years - in February he won his 100th and 101st district titles.</p>
<p>The Marangai club will head into 2017 feeling confident with a number of potential archers being coached, while the summer months mean they can spend more time on their new range at the Kaierau Rugby Club grounds.</p>
