<p><span>MINGLING: Rangatahi workers Peter London and Kiri Wilson (centre) shared the day dedicated to young people with WHS student Tayla Mack (left), 14, and Maddison Hatch, 12.</span></p>
<p>The sun was smiling down on Majestic Square at lunch time yesterday as rangatahi (youth) were celebrated with live music, pink candyfloss and a whole lot of aroha.</p>
<p>The Removing Barriers network in Wanganui organised the day to provide a fun-filled time dedicated to young people.</p>
<p>The day was part of the theme of wellbeing promoted during Mental Health Awareness Week, which is all about giving of time, presence and words.</p>
<p>Balance Whanganui youth support worker Peter London, and Kiri Wilson (former WHS student), the co-ordinator for Community Action on Youth and Drugs Programme, said the day was about encouraging youth and their whanau to share their support for each other.</p>
<p>"It's about getting out and mingling with others, being part of things; that helps everyone's wellbeing and it's especially important for youth," said Peter.</p>
<p>Music for the event was provided by UCOL contemporary performance students with some soulful singing by Vaahn Gingles on Change Gonna Come and Hina Turner on I'd Rather Go Blind.</p>
<p>UCOL Programme Co-ordinator Lizzie de Vegt said the students had been working together only since August and yesterday was just the fourth time they had performed together as a band.</p>
<p>Mental Health Awareness Week finishes tomorrow with another day of activity in Majestic Square - a health expo is giving free advice and information, and a sausage sizzle, spot prizes and live music and karaoke are on offer for all.</p>
