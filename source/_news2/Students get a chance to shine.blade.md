<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's Performing Arts Concert is an annual event which gives Whanganui a chance to see some very talented youngsters from a range of performing arts disciplines.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Called&nbsp;<em>Live at the Opera House</em>, this year's show promises two hours of top performing talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Top musicians, actors, dancers, singers, Kapa Haka, Pasifika, chamber music contestants," says Jeanette Jones, Whanganui High School Head of Music. "It's also a last chance for Year 13 students to showcase to the community, not just to the school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This is our typical showcase of the best of the best of drama, dance and music. In the two hours there will be a mix of everything," says Colin Hedivan, Head of Drama.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It will include dancers who have just competed in Dance NZ Made; it will include some of our Rockquest winners; it will include a portion of our show from earlier this year -&nbsp;<em>Rock of Ages</em>; it will include some drama performances that we have assessed just in the last week. It is literally the best of the best that the performing arts has to offer."</p>
<p><span><em>Live at the Opera House</em><span>&nbsp;is on this Saturday, September 2 at 5pm. Tickets are $12 for adults, $10 for students. Book at the Royal Wanganui Opera House or the Whanganui High School student centre.</span></span></p>
