<p>The Central North Island Regional Tournament was held on the 17&nbsp;and 18&nbsp;of March at Whanganui High School. 14 teams travelled from around the region; some coming from as far as Hawera to compete in the competition. It was a tournament of very high calibre, with the intense competition reflected by the possibility for any two, of six teams, being able to break for the final after the penultimate preliminary round.</p>
<p>The teams spent the first day debating motions including those requiring private schools to offer scholarships to ensure 20% of their rolls are students from low socio-economic backgrounds; whether or not special courts should be created across the country for alcohol and drug related offences giving out exclusively rehabilitative sentences; and whether developing countries should be exempt from international climate change obligations. They continued on the second day, with the final preliminary rounds covering whether there should be reserved places for MƒÅori in medicine and law at university, and whether we should abolish the minimum wage. While the teams consistently came to grips with the core issues of the debates, only two teams were able to break for the finals.</p>
