<p>Glastonbury Dance Studio competitors, including WHS student Jared Sim, at the NZ Open One Dance Championships.</p>
<p><span><em>Photo:</em> <em>From left they are Lynette McComb, Gordon Smith, Taliah Pollero, Coach, Mark Glastonbury, Patrick Daignault, Korbyn Garland, Dalton Jordan, Alysh Jordan, Trinity Boswell, Reeve Watson, <strong>Jared Sim</strong>&nbsp;(WHS student) and Izybel Graham</em></span></p>
<p>The event was held over 2 days in Porirua recently and attracted couples from as far afield as Auckland and Gore.</p>
<p>35 Podiums were gained including 3 wins, eight 2nd's and twenty-six 3rds.</p>
<p>For some of the studios dancers it was their first NZ National event and they all coped well with the exhaustive 370 event programme.</p>
<p>They, along with other upcoming couples within the studio, now look forward to competitions in Waikanae, Palmerston North and then on to the graded NZ Nationals event in Hamilton over Labour weekend.</p>
