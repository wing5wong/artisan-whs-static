<p class="element element-paragraph">Outgoing youth councillor Jack Southee has admitted some frustrations during his time on the Whanganui District Council's youth committee.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But he hopes it is now on the right track and that the council can work in more of a partnership with the committee to achieve its goals for Whanganui youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack joined the committee in 2015 but resigned this month due to other commitments.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was personal priorities," he said. "I'm also head boy at Whanganui High School and there's a lot of things I really want to do in my role here.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's been a huge part of my life. (Resigning) is something I did not take lightly and something I did not want to do."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His resignation is symptomatic of one of the problems, that youth councillors tend to be people who are involved in many other activities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Effort needed to be put in to expanding the type of people on the youth committee, particularly those in the 20-25 age bracket, Jack said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's (currently) a very select group of people who will really want to be energetic and really want to get out there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You find that the people who want to give up their time are the people who are less able."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are 18 spots on the youth committee out of a youth population of about 4000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's always going to be people that want to get on but it's about getting as wide a range of people as possible."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But he pointed out it's not unlike the district council itself.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I don't believe the district council is representative of our Whanganui population at all."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack said changing who was on the youth committee would be hard because a disconnect between the youth population and local government was part of the problem.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While fixing that might seem like the role of the youth committee, it needed to be done alongside the council, he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He wanted to see council going into places like schools and Ucol and discussing things like annual plans, bylaws and submissions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In his resignation letter, he wrote that he found the committee had been having to justify its place to retain its budget rather than serving youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack said he was "completely shocked" when youth committee budget cuts came out in the council's annual plan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was cut from $45,000 to $25,000. It did get a $20,000 rollover for the current year but also $10,000.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'll be honest, I was completely frustrated with council," Jack said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was frustration in the sense that I don't think the way it was handled was fair.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't believe the committee had done enough to communicate with council but equally I didn't think council had communicated their expectations to the committee."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But Jack said things were changing.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm really optimistic for the future of the youth committee because this has been a big awakening.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It should be something where there's a cohesive flow between the youth population and the council where the committee can advise the council on youth activities and happenings but also spreading positive things about Whanganui for youth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our purpose is to be youth based and youth driven."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said there was "amazing council staff' who gave up time for the committee and who the committee needed to be encouraged to work alongside.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And he urged more youth to consider joining.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If you have a passion and a willingness to want to make change... I can't recommend it enough."</p>
