<p><strong><br /></strong>Whanganui audiences who caught the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heihei.nz/config/browse/screen/audio-content/collection/details?cid=9999" target="_blank">Matariki Glow Show</a>&nbsp;at the Opera House this week may not be aware that one of the talented team behind it is from Whanganui.</p>
<p>Midge Perez - writer, composer, and co-director of the glow-in-the-dark children's stage show - was born and raised in the river city.</p>
<p>"I always loved music and had some great teachers who gave me early encouragement," Perez said.</p>
<p>He attended Castlecliff School, Rutherford Intermediate, <strong>Wanganui High School</strong> as well as Wanganui Boys' College.</p>
<p><span class="ellipsis">His talent won him a scholarship to study at Brigham Young University in Hawaii where he</span>&nbsp;<span class="QhgiTxHtog">honed his talents and upon his return to New Zealand, he caught the attention of veteran actor and artistic director of Te Rakau Hua O Te Wao Tapu Trust Jim Moriarty.</span></p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">Moriarty cast him to play the role of Jimmy in the stage play Taiki E and Perez wrote and performed much of the original music.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I had not really considered acting because the music was more my thing but he saw my potential and we spent around nine months touring the North Island."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">When he returned to Whanganui in 2000, Perez joined the crew at Awa FM hosting the rangatahi (youth) programme Ka Mau Te Wehi with Hoani Maniapoto.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"It was a live, two-hour evening show and it was a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I have very fond memories of that time."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">He would spend the next 18 months as a cocktail pianist aboard cruise ships sailing around Tahiti before returning to New Zealand and working for Family Life Education Pasefika (FLEP) in Auckland as a youth educator and performance advisor.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">He continued his youth work by becoming a clinician with Auckland agency TUPU Services supporting young people with mental health, alcohol and drug issues.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">In 2004, Perez went on the road with Te Rakau Hua O Te Wao Tapu and Moriarty playing the role of Nig Heke in the stage production of Once Were Warriors.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">Yes, he says, it felt good to represent the region in the role played by Raetihi actor Julian Arahanga in the 1994 Lee Tamahori film.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"It was not an easy role to play and I did feel quite exhausted at the end of the national tour."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">He returned to youth work for the next couple of years as an advisor for Youth Transitions Services until 2007 when he became a production manager making corporate videos and advertisements.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"That was a great experience - I really honed my production skills and it was a very valuable time."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">Perez then went to work for Grey Lynn-based company Desert Road Productions where he worked on the How to Look at a Painting TV series.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">He has written and directed Fakahela and Guardians - Nga Kaitiaki and has worked both behind and in front of the camera for a number of TV series.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">His performances include A Cold Beer, Night Shift, Rock the Boat and the feature film Crackheads.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">For the past seven years, he has worked as the principal lecturer in singing and music at Manukau Institute of Technology in Auckland.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I have had so many wonderful experiences doing work that I love and I encourage Whanganui youth to follow their dreams," says Perez.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I'm amazed at the number of people I meet who come from the awa city.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I will say 'Oh I come from a little place in the central North Island and it turns out that they are from WhangaVegas too'."</p>

<p class="QhgiTxHtog"><br />Working on the Matariki Glow Show for the last couple of years has been a "wondrous experience" for Perez.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"I met Sarah Burren who created the concept and the puppets a few years ago.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"She is an incredible talent and it has been such a pleasure to be involved with the show.</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">"Not only does it provide a wondrous experience for children but for adults as well and I've learned things I didn't know about Matariki myself."</p>
<p class="QhgiTxHtog">A busy schedule does not allow Perez much time for trips home although he thinks of Whanganui often he says and hopes to visit whanau and his favourite childhood haunts soon.</p>
