<p>Brass Whanganui are on top of the world or at least the New Zealand brass band music scene, coming away from the recent Brass Band Championships in Blenheim with nine trophies and the shield for the best B Grade band in the country. It is a huge improvement from last year when they were &ldquo;in the middle of the pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chair of Brass Whanganui, Jonathon Greenwell said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immensely proud of the band. We had<span class="text_exposed_show">&nbsp;no real idea we would do so well. When we got first with 90 out of 100 for the Hymn and Test performances on the Friday, it was &lsquo;Oh my God.&rsquo; The free choice on the Saturday was more competitive and the final result was close. When we heard, we erupted in huge cheers.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Bruce Jellyman, Musical Director for the band said, &ldquo;Everything came together. It was an amazing performance. The judge&rsquo;s notes simply said &lsquo;Well done. Thankyou.&rsquo; When they put their pens down to listen and enjoy, you know you&rsquo;ve cracked it.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Both Bruce and Jonathon give credit to Drum Major, Gordon Ririnui, for training and then leading them in the street marches.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">However, the band is happy to stay in the B grade, says Bruce. All provincial bands have the problem of loosing young players, usually to university in the big cities. &ldquo;We will lose three of our younger members over Christmas,&rdquo; Bruce adds. &ldquo;It is a seven to eight-year cycle and we are in year three.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The results were:ian<br />&bull; Winners of the sacred item and test major work categories as well as Best B Grade band.<br />&bull; <strong>Sarah Wright &ndash; Junior cornet champion and second junior overall.</strong><br />&bull; Hamish Jellyman and Ian O&rsquo;Malley &ndash; winners open duet.<br />&bull; <strong>Jonathon Greenwell (ex WHS student) &ndash; 3rd open brass trombone with the trombone trio second.</strong><br />&bull; Andrew Toy &ndash; best soloist in the test work on flugelhorn.<br />&bull; Three trophies for the street march and second across all bands.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="text_exposed_show">WHS past and present students Ethan Mancer and Jonathan Stolk were also a part of the winning team!</span></strong></p>
