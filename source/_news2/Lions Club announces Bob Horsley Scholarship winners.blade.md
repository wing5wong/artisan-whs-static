<p>Lions Club announces Bob Horsley Scholarship winners.<br /><br /><span>Wanganui Lions Club President Stuart Kelly with from the left: Sam Bridger (ex WHS 2016), Jayden Rhodes and Luke Foster</span></p>
<p>Back in the 1970&rsquo;s the Wanganui Lions Club entered into a partnership with the Wanganui City Council to plant a pine forest around the Lake Wiritoa area. This was very innovative of the Wanganui Lions members at the time, to make such a long term commitment.</p>
<p>Almost 30 years later the forest was harvested and the Wanganui Lions received their share of the profits. These profits were then set aside and a student scholarship&nbsp;<span class="text_exposed_show">for apprentices was established. This scholarship came under the auspices of the Wanganui Lions Charitable Trust, and was named the Bob Horsley Scholarship Fund, after a long term and hardworking Lions member.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The terms of the scholarship stated that the interest on the invested money would be used each year and awarded to suitable trade apprentice applicants. These awards have been presented annually since 2010.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">This year awards were made to three apprentices. They each received $700 towards either training or tools necessary for their trade.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The 2017 recipients are :&nbsp;<br />&bull; Sam Bridger, auto electrician from Wanganui Auto Electrical;&nbsp;<br />&bull; Jayden Rhodes, general engineer from Hymech NZ Ltd and<br />&bull; Luke Foster, diesel technician from Emmetts Truck Services.</span></p>
