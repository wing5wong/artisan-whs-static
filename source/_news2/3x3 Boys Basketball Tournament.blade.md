<p><span>Our 3x3 Boys Basketball team finished their tournament off on a high note today (23 March 2018) winning both their games.</span></p>
<p><span>The boys have had a great time regardless of the final result which is what it&rsquo;s all about.</span></p>
<p><span>Well done boys!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Big thank you to Ross Cronshaw and Adam Watkins for taking the boys away and looking after them!&nbsp;</span></p>
