Recycle the Label is a new clothing shop at 181a Victoria Ave, where Blank Canvas used to be. It is unlike other second hand clothing shops in that, as the name says, it wants to recycle label clothing.

Liberty Bracegirdle got the idea when she was travelling in the USA and saw this type of shop set in a “city/industrial vibe.” It is part of the worldwide trend towards sustainable fashion and quality clothing.

The concept works as follows:
• Designer label clothes can be either sold on behalf or donated, with the commission going towards the local Women’s Refuge.
• They will be sold for the full price for up to five weeks, and if not sold by then, reduced by 50% for a further three weeks.
• If not sold after eight weeks, the clothing will be donated to Women’s Refuge.

Liberty says, “The price depends on label, condition and style,” and Liberty knows her brands.

Women’s Refuge is an important cause for Liberty. Two years ago she volunteered at their pop-up clothing shop which sold designer clothing. Her mother, Lynda Armstrong, is a volunteer and committee member at Women’s Refuge.

The shop has some significant advantages over selling online. People like to try clothes on before buying and there is no likelihood of being scammed.

Recycle the Label will also sell shoes, handbags and jewellery. There is also a small collection of men’s clothing. It is open from 9.30am to 5pm, Mondays to Fridays and from 10am to 3pm on Saturdays.
