Whanganui Labour Party members have now had the opportunity to meet and question the two prospective candidates to represent the Party at the 2020 election. The candidates are Steph Lewis, the Party’s 2017 candidate and Tim Easton. The vote will take place on the weekend of November 16/17 and will be known by the time the Labour Party’s New Zealand conference occurs in Whanganui later this month.

The electorate incorporates the South Taranaki towns of Eltham, Stratford, Hawera, Waverley, Waitotara and Patea as well as Whanganui and has diverse political interests. At the last election the winning margin for the National Party was 1706, down from 4505 in 2014.

The selection of the Whanganui candidate is the first to be made for the 2020 General Election. This reflects the Party’s view that this is a winnable seat.

The candidate chosen to represent Labour can demonstrate that the current Government is meaningfully addressing the many serious issues that confronted it when it took office and that Government policies are benefitting local constituents.

When selected the Whanganui Labour candidate will have the opportunity to keep local constituents better informed of the work being undertaken by the Coalition Government.

On the weekend beginning November 29, the Labour Party Conference will be held in Whanganui. It will give a significant economic boost to the city as well as further enhancing its profile. It was a very significant achievement of local Labour to get the conference in Whanganui.

The Conference will be held at a time when many economic indicators are positive, but it will have occasion to debate the many long-term problems in our society. The new Labour candidate will be an active participant in that process.
