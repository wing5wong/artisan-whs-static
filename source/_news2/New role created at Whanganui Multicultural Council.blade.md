<p class="element element-paragraph">With a focus on preventing domestic violence and everyday racism, the Multicultural Council of Rangit朝kei/Whanganui has employed a part-time co-ordinator.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Juan-Carlos Penn-Reina (former WHS student) is usually known as Carlos Penn. He has a Whanganui father and Colombian mother. He started the new job a month ago, works 10 hours a week from home and can be contacted on 022 325 6384.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The council held a successful pot luck dinner this month, where people could talk about domestic violence.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">President Vijeshwar Prasad said the combined stress of adapting to a new culture and getting by financially could easily boil over into violence for migrants.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui Police Constable Dean Erickson and Whanganui Women's Refuge manager Heather Perry were both at the dinner to talk to people.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In another new initiative, Prasad and Penn are considering having a Race Relations Day in Whanganui's Majestic Square next March.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In Whanganui some people are racist. Every migrant who has come to New Zealand has gone through some racial abuse," Prasad said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They would like as to involve as many ethnic communities as possible.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are lots of migrants coming into Whanganui at the moment. They are mainly retired people from Auckland, Prasad said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>A new council project will be a one-day bus trip for new arrivals and international students in August or September, to show them what Whanganui has.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The council also holds the Diwali Cultural Night in November and a marae visit in February, and is involved with Whanganui District Council's Festival of Cultures and Welcoming Communities Plan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It has 27 members, from China, Fiji, Pakistan, Korea and the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's funded by a $15,000 a year grant from the Lotteries Commission, and from Prasad's own pocket.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A retired teacher, he bought the house next door to him in Anzac Parade for his immigration consultancy business.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He's called it Multicultural House and two rooms are available for anyone to use.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He will be grateful for the help of Penn, because he has other priorities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"I don't want to become too busy because I'm retired and I enjoy travelling," he said.</span></p>
