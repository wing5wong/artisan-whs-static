<p class="element element-paragraph">After a winter layoff, the speedway season is set to burst into life this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Grand Opening meeting at Fast Lane Spares Oceanview Family Speedway takes place tomorrow night from 6pm, and the season will get off to an explosive start.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Wanganui Stockcar and Speedway Club has a new naming rights sponsor, as Fast Lane Spares has come on board for the next five years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Although the business is based in Palmerston North, it has a strong Whanganui connection through staffers Peter Sloman and Mike Palmer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In addition, many Whanganui racers are Fast Lane Spares customers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When racing gets underway this weekend, all classes will compete for double points.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There has been plenty of work going on in workshops and sheds around the region as speedway competitors race to get their vehicles ready for the new season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Superstock class, to be sponsored this season by Wanganui Toyota, is set to get a shot in the arm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">New cars for Shaun Smith and Dion Mooney, although the latter is a few meetings away, will boost the field, as will the return of Scott Duncan after a season off due to ill health.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Smith's Nissan-powered car was impressive in practice on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Max Holloway's 81V car was hastily rebuilt by club members last week after his father Karl's sudden death.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Holloway showed great promise in his debut season in the car and will be another to watch this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WSSC president Daryl James has given up the Clerk of the Course role this season to campaign the 52V Superstock he purchased earlier this year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And Palmerston North-based Superstock driver Sheridan O'Hara has contracted to the Wanganui club this season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The previous Andy McCabe Nissan-powered car will race as 9V.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Stockcar class, Damon Baxter and Jason Wright are racing against time to finish new cars.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mooney's two-time 2NZ car has been rebuilt over the winter, and will again be the car to beat.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Callum Sturzaker</strong> had an impressive debut season after graduating from Youth Ministocks, and Mason James was another to impress last season.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are plenty of new faces in the Ministock and Production Saloon classes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A standout at practice was Shayne Hughes' immaculate new Nissan Production Saloon.<br />In the Sidecars, brothers Aaron and Bryce Rose have teamed up on the machine which carried Bryce to 3NZ last season with John Hannan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The presentation of this machine is immaculate.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lastly, Midgets and Minisprints will complete the field for Sunday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Huijs racing team Midgets will be joined by out-of-town competitors.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the Minisprints, the opening round of their Oval Superstars Tour will be held at Oceanview on November 17, so visiting drivers can be expected to check the track out on Sunday night.<span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Big things will be expected of Wanganui-contracted driver Dylan Smith, who was lightning-fast at practice.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Smith will make a dash to Whanganui on Sunday afternoon after a weekend competing in his Mazda RX7 at Manfield Park.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But that's not the only action tomorrow night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When it's dark, the skies over Fast Lane Spares Oceanview Family Speedway will light up with fireworks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To mark the start of the new season, the team from Kairanga Lions Club will put on one of their spectacular displays.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">There's plenty of food and drink available on site, or bring a picnic tea to enjoy before the action kicks off at 6pm.</p>
