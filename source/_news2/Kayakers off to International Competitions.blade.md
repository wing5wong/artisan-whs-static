<h3><span>WHS students Jack&nbsp;<span>Clifton, Lucas Thompson</span>&nbsp;and Sophie&nbsp;<span>Brooke all off overseas to represent New Zealand.</span></span></h3>
<h3>Whanganui High School Year 13 students, Jack Clifton and Lucas Thompson, have been selected to the New Zealand Canoe Racing team for the ICF Junior World Championships in Romania on August 1 &ndash; 4, while fellow schoolmate, Sophie Brooke, will represent New Zealand in the U18 squad at the Asia Pacific Cup regatta in May at Karapiro.</h3>
<p>To get this far requires a huge commitment in time, effort and money. Sophie and Lucas get up by 5.30am t<span class="text_exposed_show">o be on the river by 6. Jack lives at Waitotara Beach and has to get up at 5am as he has a 30 minute drive. That&rsquo;s the morning practice. In the afternoon they are back on the river for another two hour session. In total they do about 9 to 10 sessions each week.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">So the RCP asked them why do they do it? Sophie says she has been inspired by her older brother who has also represented New Zealand at the Junior World Championships. Jack says, &ldquo;I drove past once, thought it was a good thing and now I really enjoy it.&rdquo; Lucas did kayaking at a year 7 school camp in Otaki, liked it and decided to take it seriously.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">There is a financial cost. Jack attended the Youth Championships last year in Bulgaria and it cost around $7000 and this year&rsquo;s trip will be similar. It involved being based in another European country for a few weeks to prepare for the championships. The trio are hoping that their applications to the Whanganui Future Champions Trust will bear fruit but otherwise it boils down to sausage sizzles, raffles and working after school or during the holidays &ndash; plus support from loving parents.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Jack and Lucas don&rsquo;t know what class they will be racing in yet but it will be either the K2 (two person) or K4. Only one boat from each country is allowed in each event. Likewise Sophie, but she is happy whatever role she is given.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The local club had 16 kayakers at the Nationals and came third in the medal tally &ndash; punching way above their weight (if that is a useful term for athletes who are water-based).</span></p>
