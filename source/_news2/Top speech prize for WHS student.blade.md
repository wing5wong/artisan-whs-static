<p class="element element-paragraph">Sophia 'Unga-Cribb says she was destined to be a good public speaker "straight from the womb".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The 14-year-old was recently crowned the winner in the junior English section at the Ngā Manu Kōrero national secondary school speech final.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Our family is pretty talkative, you're always fighting for airspace," 'Unga-Cribb says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Speeches have always been a part of the family."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>Her uncle Dallas Cribb and cousin Matariki Cribb are previous winners of the Taa Turi Kara trophy at the competition.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There was a slight bit of pressure to bring back the trophy for the Cribb's, but I did it," 'Unga-Cribb says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a bit heavy, but she'll be right."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">'Unga-Cribb attended Te Kura o Kokohuia, before moving on to Whanganui Intermediate School and she now attends Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said that all of her teachers, or kaiako, have helped with her learning and development, but no one has been as important as her Mum, Piri Cribb.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Mum taught me how to be a confident speaker when I was young," 'Unga-Cribb says.</p>

<div id="article-content">
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's always been Mum, she's my coach, my personal life coach."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">'Unga-Cribb performed her six-minute speech&nbsp;<em>10 ways to teach me</em>&nbsp;in front of a packed out Houhoupiko Showgrounds in Gisborne.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It started out as banter between me and Mum about parenting, I used to hold her accountable for things to do with it," 'Unga-Cribb says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Like if we were arguing, she'd change the subject and I'd call her out and say 'Parenting 101, change the subject so your daughter doesn't remember what you're arguing about.'"</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Other factors focused on in the speech were accountability, responsibility, freedom to make mistakes, opportunities, courage, happiness, confidence and love.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A lot of practise goes into delivering a good speech, 'Unga-Cribb says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The gestures you use, the tone of your voice and even your facial expressions come into it. If you say something happy and you're frowning, that's going to confuse people.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I like the adrenaline rush you get on stage and that feeling of satisfaction you get when you finish your speech. It's a good feeling and to win is just a bonus."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">'Unga-Cribb is focusing on one big event at a time currently, but will be looking at adding a senior English title to her list of accolades at Ngā Manu Kōrero next year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Piri Cribb attended the final, she felt many emotions throughout the experience, but the overwhelming feeling was pride.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's a piece in her speech about the freedom to make mistakes," Cribb says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"As a parent, there are times that you can't fully control what's going on for your child and having to let them go out and do it on their own can be scary.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Watching her up there on the stage was scary, but I was confident that she had it and when they announced her as the winner, I was elated.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm honored as her mother that she would see me as someone who can have that kind of influence on her life."</p>
