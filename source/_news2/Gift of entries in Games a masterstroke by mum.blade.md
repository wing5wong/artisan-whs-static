<p class="element element-paragraph">When Whanganui woman Sue Watson was looking for the ideal Christmas presents for her family, entries to the 2019 Downer New Zealand Masters Games seemed the perfect solution.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So she has entered her three children - along with their partners - in a variety of events.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At first I thought I could enter them all in the five-kilometre walk. However, two of them are too young, so they have been entered in track events," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just thought the kids are all involved in sport in some capacity, and they are now of an appropriate age, so what better way to bring everyone together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson and partner Roger's three children - Tim, Penny and Simon - are thrilled with their gifts and all are considering entering further events at the games.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There is talk of taking part in the weightlifting as we have a couple of cross-fitters in the group - or even the swimming," Watson said. She and Roger will be on babysitting duty looking after their six grandchildren while supporting from the sidelines.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We think the Masters Games is a fantastic event for Whanganui, we have always got behind it in the past and now want to encourage the next generation to give it a go."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson took advantage of the early bird registrations which close next Wednesday, October 31. From November 1, general entry fees will apply for all registrations.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It is most definitely worth entering early," she said. "Now the Games registrations are done, the kids can enter as many events as they like, babysitters permitting."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Downer NZ Masters Games run in Whanganui from February 1 to February 10, attracting competitors from all around New Zealand, and internationally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There are no qualifying standards, apart from the age limit for each sport, and athletes in their 80s and 90s are just as likely to be lining up as those in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The focus is on participation and friendship, and the social programme is just as important as the sport.</p>
