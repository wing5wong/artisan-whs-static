<p class="element element-paragraph">Four Whanganui young people have had a boost in self-confidence and motivation after completing a Limited Service Volunteers (LSV) course.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Maia Rauhina (19), former WHS student Cole McKenzie (21), Jordan Kake (19) and Joseph Martini-Rerekura (18) participated in a six-week voluntary course for 17 to 24-year-olds at Burnham Military Camp.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The course, organised by Work and Income and run by the NZ Defence Force, aims to improve self-discipline, self-confidence and motivation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Maia said her biggest challenge was speaking in front of people but she "got over that".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was chosen to perform in front of the whole company of 100 and after doing that I felt comfortable with public speaking," Maia said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She has since found work with a national food distributor in Queenstown.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cole, who also gained confidence in public speaking on the course, said even when he found the course difficult he kept going.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really loved the experience and it got me out of my shell a lot more," Cole said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a great experience and I would recommend it to friends."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jordan, who has been offered a plumbing apprenticeship, said the highlight for him was a 30km march where he had to carry an additional bag when a friend's shoulder was injured.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This course made me fit as," Jordan said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It gave me heaps of motivation to do press ups every night. My favourite day was the march, carrying two packs. I was walking up steep hills but still waiting for the rest of my platoon to catch up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I recommend you going there if you want a change or are looking at doing something for yourself and you want to be a better person."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Joseph said his favourite part of the course was the sports day with the whole company.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The four volunteers attended a graduation ceremony at the Whanganui District Council chamber on Wednesday where they were recognised by Mayor Hamish McDouall, Work and Income staff and local employers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Gloria Campbell, regional commissioner for Work and Income, said she was always amazed at the change the course made to young people who attended.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This course gives you the skills and attitude to move forward and that's what you need if you want to succeed in the job market," Campbell said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It also gives you a sense of self-esteem, achievement, discipline and motivation. These are really good life skills for employers and will help you through the future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Today you have an awesome opportunity and it's up to you to make that into a positive future and Work and Income will support you to do that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Employers from Sport Whanganui and Axiam Plastics spoke about what employers are looking for, which is to be self-managed, confident, organised and enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">McDouall said he had often met graduates from the LVS course who had gone on to do other study and work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This can only be a springboard to employment and training and not the end point," McDouall said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Aim high, aim for your dreams. You've got your life ahead of you, you are strong and you can do anything."</p>
