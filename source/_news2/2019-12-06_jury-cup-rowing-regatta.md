The annual Jury Rowing Cup organised by the Aramoho Rowing Club, is Whanganui’s largest regatta and according to one club official “seems to have been in existence for ever.”

This year there are 10 clubs participating – Hawkes Bay, Clifton from Waitara, whose Head Coach is Philippa Baker-Hogan, Aramoho Whanganui, Union Boating Club, Collegiate School, Wellington Clubs - Star, Petone, Porirua and Wellington and the Horowhenua boating club from Levin. Rowing on the River can be an added attraction to Wellington clubs having to avoid travelling ferries.

There are 484 competitors entered made up of 443 crews across differing boat classifications – Eights, fours, doubles etc. The race schedule includes 62 events with the largest fields being - 18 entries in the Women’s novice eights, 18 entries in the under 17 double sculls and 20 entries in the Novice doubles.

Bruce Osborn, President of the Aramoho Rowing Club says, “This is very encouraging to see such large fields in the Novice ranks as it highlights the interest and growth in rowing across the regions.”

The start time on Saturday is 7.30am and if all goes to schedule, racing will go through until late afternoon. If conditions on the river deteriorate at any stage on Saturday then Sunday morning is scheduled as a reserve day to hopefully complete the scheduled races.

Female rowers outnumber their male counterparts with 285 female athletes to 199 males. Bruce comments, “These stats highlight the growth of girls/women rowers, who have embraced the sport over the past few years.”

A full race commentary will be broadcast from speakers located on Somme Parade with the races being contested over 2000 meters and the event held on the Aramoho Championship course.

The organising group supported by so many volunteers, needs to be congratulated for organising such a large event.
Last year defending champions, Aramoho-Wanganui, won another comprehensive victory.

The Jury Cup events will provide rowers with vital competitive experience prior to heading to the Karapiro Regatta from December 13 to 15 to compete against the best of North Island rowers.
