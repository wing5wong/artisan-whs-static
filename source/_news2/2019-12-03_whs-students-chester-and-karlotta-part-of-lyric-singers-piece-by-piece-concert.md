Two Whanganui High School students performed in the recent Lyric Singers’ ‘Piece by Piece’ concert on Saturday November 23, held at Christ Church. This concert raised funds for Jigsaw Whanganui.

**Karlotta Hartz** is an international student who has been studying at this school for the second half of this year. She plays the flute and enjoys singing. Karlotta was a student in Ms Love’s ENG1 English class. Ms Love invited Karlotta to join Lyric Singers, a community choir, which Ms Love conducts. Karlotta performed in the choir’s mid-year and end of year concerts, singing in the soprano section of the choir. The choir was delighted to have Karlotta singing in the choir and are sorry that they will not have the pleasure of her company next year, as Karlotta will return home to Germany.

**Chester Nevil** performed with Lyric Singers as a guest artist last year as a member of the WHS percussion group, ‘Buzz Rolls’. Chester is a skilled percussionist, who has received excellent tuition from Michael Franklin-Browne, an itinerant percussion tutor at Whanganui High School. This year, Chester performed again as a guest artist, as a member of Abacus, a jazz trio. Abacus Trio regularly perform at venues around Whanganui. For this concert, the trio teamed up with vocal soloist, Denise McNeill, presenting three jazz pieces.
