The annual Latin America & Spain Film Festival is returning for the sixth year from September 5 to 13, and thanks four members of the Whanganui Hispanic Arts Group – Andrea Gardner, Queralt Scott, Beverly Stuart and Marilyn Wilkie – who have done all the organising in Whanganui.

The festival is part of a nationwide festival covering 11 centres from September to the end of October and is made possible thanks to the Latin American and Spanish embassies either in New Zealand or in Australia.

Marilyn says, “The films this year are a good mix of comedies, drama and documentaries.” Her recommendation is ‘Marshland’ from Spain. “It is an atmospheric crime thriller set in the deep south of Spain in the marshlands, set just after the death of Franco.”

Other recommended films include:

• ‘Little Secret’ from Brazil. This is a co-production between Brazil and New Zealand and tells a story based on true events. Andrea says, “It is a film to bring your hankie to.”

• ‘Gabo, The Magic of Reality’ from Colombia. This documentary presents how the political struggles of Latin America in the 70s and 80s, influenced the writing of Garcia Marquez, who Marilyn says is “Latin America’s most famous writer. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982.”

• ‘Old Friends’ from Peru. Barbara loves this one saying, “It is a quirky comedy about friendship in old age.”

There will be a celebration fiesta during the festival and two ambassadors – from Spain and Chile – will be in attendance showing their respect for what is happening in Whanganui. There will be Latin American/Spanish music complete with a Mariachi band from Wellington, dancing led by ‘Dance Whanganui’, food from the region and as Queralt says, “Beautiful people.”

The films will generally screen on Thursdays and Saturdays at 7pm with another 4pm showing on Saturdays. There will be one showing on a Tuesday. The venue is the Davis Theatre in Watt Street and members of the Hispanic group will be giving brief introductions to each film.

Attendance is free and the group thanks the District Council and the Sarjeant for their support. Brochures will be available from the library, cafes and at the RCP.
