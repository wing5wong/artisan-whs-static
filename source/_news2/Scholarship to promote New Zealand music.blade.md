<p>Former WHS student Liam Wooding has been chosen for a prestigious piano school in Australia.</p>
<p>A Whanganui pianist has been chosen for a prestigious music school in Australia.</p>
<p>Liam Wooding will head off in February to Melbourne to take part in the Australian National Academy of Music's Professional Performance Program.</p>
<p>He's one of only four pianist chosen to take part, and the only New Zealander in this years intake. While he may be heading across the ocean to the premiere music institution for Australia, in his mind Liam's feet are planted firmly on New Zealand ground.</p>
<p>"I've always thought of myself as living in New Zealand and contributing to our profession."</p>
<p>His main forte is classical music, and while he respects the greats like Mozart he has a special affection for modern Kiwi composers. Like Whanganui's own Douglas Lilbern and Wellington's John Psathas.</p>
<p>"In New Zealand there are so many wide ranging styles and ideas, so much original thought goes on here."<br />"Its not inhibited by tradition so much...so all sorts come out."</p>
<p>He would like to see kiwi music promoted, and preserved for future generations.</p>
<p>"I believe its important for our cultural preservation."<br />"Even if people think its not as good as Mozart its more important that it gets given a chance."<br />"If we don't then it will be lost."</p>
<p>While his affection is for New Zealand music he's stoked to have this opportunity in Australia to grow as a musician.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Its the direction I want to head in, the specific things that they do."</p>
<p>The school teaches piano in a variety of different contexts including chamber music, practising solo performances and experimental music. The course will take a minimum of one year, and will involve performing throughout Australia and at least one performance in China.</p>
<p>"I like to try new things, I'm curious... I think that's what its about."</p>
<p>From and early age Liam was interested in music. At Westmere School he was encouraged to try different musical types and became involved in the school choir. At Wanganui High School he took part in a pre-tertiary programme in Wellington for aspiring young musicians.</p>
<p>He says at the programme he saw musicians from around New Zealand. Liam felt like a "country bum kin" from Whanganui. But he soon gained his confidence.</p>
<p>There he meet the late Judith Clark a well respected but fearsome music teacher.</p>
<p>"She was well known to be a dragon."<br />"But she instilled a sense that what you do needs to be respected to the highest degree."<br />"So I got the gravity or profoundness for the amazing gift we have."</p>
<p>He went on to complete his Bachelor of Music degree at Auckland University and is currently a observer pianist at the Wanganui New Zealand Opera School at Collegiate School.</p>
<p>His performances have been called "astounding" by Music reviewer Peter Mechen. Liam says the Australian National Academy of Music will simply be the next challenge.</p>
<p>Before he leaves he will be performing with Debbie Kapohe and Ingrid Culliford on January 29 for a fundraiser for the Sargeant Art Gallery.</p>
