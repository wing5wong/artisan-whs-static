<p class="element element-paragraph">At the start of the Harvey Round Motors Isuzu Winter Series MX season, James Rountree set himself a goal and on Sunday he achieved it.</p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">It was the final day of the season at Languards Bluff and the 16-year-old pulled off a remarkable double, winning the Junior 125cc class and the Senior A Grade Under.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The accomplishment has never been achieved in motocross at the Wanganui Motorcycle Club.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was my goal at the start of the series to win those two classes," Rountree said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"That was the first time I've won two classes in a series and I've got to say thanks to everyone who has helped me out. It was really good."About 150 riders competed at each event aged from just 4 years old right up to 67.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next, Rountree finishes club series for Taupo and ManawatÅ« before travelling the Tasman for a second crack at the Junior MotoX Nationals in Tasmania in September.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I did the Junior Nationals in Australia last year, but I'm hoping to do a bit better this year now that I know what the competition's like," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They're pretty fast over there, but I'm a lot faster than I was last year and I'll have a better mindset heading into it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountree said he doesn't have a clear goal for Australia, he is just going to go over and do the best he can.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the meantime, it is training as usual.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'll ride most weekends and do lots of off-the-bike training like cycling, mountain biking and a bit of gym work too, like the rowing machine," Rountree said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You have to be quite fit to do motocross, most people don't understand that unless they've ridden before. It's quite hard to explain."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Strength is a big factor when it comes to riding and competing in motocross.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It helps you control your bike a lot better and helps you hit your lines every lap," Rountree said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I used to just do a lot of cardio and I'd find that at the end of a race my technique wouldn't be that great.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But now I've been working on strength a bit more and I'm able to not make so many mistakes at the end of a race."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountree was 4 or 5 years old when he first became interested in motorbikes and motocross.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He started riding when his dad, Antony Rountree, got back into riding and bought a bike after he had stopped for some time.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He is inspired by Dutchman Jeffrey Herlings and American Eli Tomac. If he keeps this up, he might be that inspiration for others one day.</p>
