<p>The vibe. music festival returns to Cooks Gardens this Saturday.</p>
<p>Headlining the show is talented hip hop musician Kings, who works out of his marae in Auckland and last year ruled the top spot on the music charts for weeks with his catchy single &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Worry Bout It&rsquo;. Other acts include nomad (an original indie pop sound with barbershop vocals) and the rich, soulful voice of Whenua Patuwai.</p>
<p>Whanganui District Council&rsquo;s Youth Committee, which organises the Vibe Festival, is ser<span class="text_exposed_show">ious about creating opportunities for Whanganui youth &ndash; this is the second vibe. festival they have run.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Youth Committee&rsquo;s Organising Chair,<strong> Josie Verhaaren</strong> says, &ldquo;As well as organising a great event for youth to attend, part of our mission is to provide a platform for young local talent, giving them an opportunity to perform alongside established musicians.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Local band, <strong>Late Night Tales</strong>, will showcase their acoustic jazz hip hop sound and<strong> Ra Costelloe</strong>, who was recently chosen out of a large field of contenders to open for Tiki Taane, will be back to entertain his home crowd. Whanganui High School band <strong>The Remnant</strong>, winners of the Te Reo award at the national Smokefreerockquest final, are bringing their smooth, sophisticated sound to the event, along with a line-up of other exciting college bands. There will also be performances from two times national dance crew champions Aotea Empire, from Whanganui City College and Cullinane College&rsquo;s kapa haka group.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">From 3pm to 11pm Cooks Gardens will come alive with performances, activities, stalls and food trucks. There will be plenty of sweet and savoury food options available and people are welcome to bring along snacks, water and picnic blankets. Please be aware that this is a smoke-free and alcohol-free event.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">And this event is more than just a music festival. As with last year, the focus is on addressing the stigma around mental health issues. Ms Verhaaren says, &ldquo;This is an issue that greatly affects youth in our community, touching all of our lives in one way or another.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Youth Committee is made up of a diverse range of young people, aged from 12 to 24, and their brief is to improve health and wellbeing for youth in the community. Ms Verhaaren says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m incredibly proud of the Youth Committee, who have been working hard all year to organise this positive event for the community.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The festival will include information stalls and resources and this year the Youth Committee has invited Chl&ouml;e Swarbrick MP to speak on the issue of mental health. The vibe. festival is a non-profit event, donating a portion of all ticket sales to Youthline.<br /></span></p>
