<p class="element element-paragraph">The Aramoho Wanganui Rowing Club is on the hunt for a head coach after Pedro Figueira has stood down after 18 months in the job.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Portuguese rowing maestro concedes he is leaving the job reluctantly to be with his wife and two young children in Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The weekend commute from the capital had become too much of a struggle for his young family. His wife failed to find suitable employment in Whanganui since arriving from the UK last year despite having a Masters in biology and being a trained secondary school teacher.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Figueira arrived in late February last year to replace Ian Weenink who took up a coaching position in China.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Figueira left his job as national coach for the Portuguese Rowing Federation and shifted to New Zealand to take on the role and immerse himself in what he called the "powerhouse of world rowing".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He has nearly two decades of professional coaching experience as well as a solid credential backing. His Bachelor of Law was followed by a Masters in sports management and a level two rowing coaching certificate.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">During his time as national coach, Portugal earned their first gold medal at a World Cup.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At university-level rowing Figueira was chief coach of the lightweight programme at Oxford University, and at the London Rowing Club he was responsible for the lightweight development group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You have a very unique environment for rowing here in Whanganui and I very sad to be leaving," Figueira said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He was reluctant to dwell on his achievements as head coach and more interested in talking about the evolution of the AWRC even in his relatively short time at the helm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My focus has been more on helping the club find its place. Over the last decade New Rowing has evolved and clubs have tried to find how they can fit the changing environment. I have been a part of Aramoho Wanganui's journey and I think that has been one of my better contributions. I found the club in very good spirits when I took over from Ian Weenink.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There is some really good raw talent here, although there is a lot of raw talent in many other sports in Whanganui, canoeing for instance."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Figueira said developing raw talent was best served by creating an environment to allow it to grow naturally.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Often that happens by encouraging club members and athletes to create that environment themselves - it's the same in business. Pathways and club culture need to be created and open discussion is needed."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Figueira has been heavily involved guiding secondary school rowers and in particular Whanganui High School athletes.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We also have a very good relationship with Wanganui Collegiate and the Union Boat Club. Rowing is very healthy here."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While New Zealand has not done too well at the latest World Championships in Bulgaria, Figueira was happy to note that two of the three medals won by our elite crews featured AWRC members in Kerri Gowler and <strong>Chris Harris.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think New Zealand rowing will bounce back."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Figueira leaves at the end of the month to take up a position with the Star Boating Club in Wellington.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It will be a slightly different focus. I will be coaching the coaches of four different schools - Wellington Boys, Wellington Girls, Wellington East and Scots College."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">AWRC president Bruce Osborne said Figueira's influence, while short term, had been a fantastic experience for the club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Pedro has been absolutely fantastic and we have been lucky to have him. It is sad to see him go," Osborne said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In the short term we will advertise internally within the club and then begin the process of advertising nationwide and internationally like we did when Ian left."</p>
