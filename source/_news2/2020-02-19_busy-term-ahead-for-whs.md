Tēnā koutou katoa,

We have had a very settled beginning to the 2020 school year since our first day of Term 1 on Monday, 27 January. I have taken this opportunity to enable our Head Boy (Connor Hoskin) and Head Girl (Leah Aiono) to introduce themselves to you.

“Over the four years that we have spent at Whanganui High School, we have watched the student body evolve as a new group joins each year. As Head Boy and Head Girl, we are excited to take a more direct role in developing and guiding the students of Whanganui High School in 2020.

Already, we have seen our newest year group grow in confidence as they become accustomed to life at Whanganui High School, and begin to participate in events and extra-curricular activities that are starting to take place. With Swimming Sports, a school production ‘Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’, and Athletics’ Day all coming up very soon in the school calendar, there are already plenty of opportunities available for students to get involved and form new connections with their peers, as well as to become familiar with our house system and build up a bit of friendly rivalry. 

This all contributes towards some of the goals we have for our last year at high school. We aim to continue to encourage a friendly, welcoming atmosphere, in which people feel supported in trying new things; we aim to create opportunities for students to showcase their talents; and, above all, we aim to maintain a strong sense of unity and belonging within our school”.
