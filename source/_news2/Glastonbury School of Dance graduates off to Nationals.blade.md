<p><strong>WHS student Jared and Reeve with Jonny Williams, participant in the Dancing With the Stars&rsquo; TV programme, providing extra coaching.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jared Sim aged 16 and Reeve Watson, aged only 12 have been dancing together for just nine months but this Labour weekend will take on the rest of New Zealand at the National Championships in Hamilton.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>They do, however, have a lot more individual experience than this brief partnership belies. Both have come through the Glastonbury Dance School &lsquo;Dancing in Schools&rsquo; programme. Jared was involved at Wanganui Intermediate fou<span class="text_exposed_show">r years ago and Reeve through St Mary&rsquo;s, two years ago.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Mark Glastonbury says, &ldquo;Both realise that hard work is required to compete at a high level. This shows in their work and practice ethic and recent results.&rdquo; As juniors (from 13 to 16, although you can compete in one level above as Reeve is doing) they have won numerous North Island events this year.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">They also regularly place in the top three when entered in &lsquo;All in events&rsquo; &ndash; that is against the adult age groups. They will advance into youth (16 to 19) and Adult (16 plus) ranks next year, due to Jared&rsquo;s age, meaning that Reeve will be one of the youngest in the fields.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Mark has taught Dancesport, previously known as Ballroom Dancing for 13 years in Whanganui. </span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">It is designed with dance as the vehicle but delivers fitness, builds confidence, teamwork, respect and responsible interaction with the opposite gender. Schools often use the dance sessions for graduation prep, portions of a production and/or a school Dance Off.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Further schools can join the programme with a free 90 minute session being offered to be used in term 1 of 2019. If the school then decides they would like to be part of a separate schools&rsquo; competition, they can then undertake further lessons.<br /></span></p>
