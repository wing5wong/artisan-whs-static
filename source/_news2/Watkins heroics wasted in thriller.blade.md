<p>The best efforts of Whanganui's Jessica Watkin was not enough to prevent her Central District Hinds suffering a two wicket loss to the Wellington Blaze at Lincoln Green in Canterbury on Thursday.</p>
<p>It followed on from Wednesday where the Blaze won another thriller by one wicket.</p>
<p>On Thursday, after the rest of the top order, including Whanganui team mates Michelle Mitchell and Lisa Grant, fell quickly to leave the Hinds 35-3, Watkin put on the top score of 77 from 72 balls, including two sixes and nine boundaries.</p>
<p>That knock and an undefeated 75 from wicketkeeper Kelly Rangi helped the Hinds through to 224-7 from their 39 overs in the rain effected match.</p>
<p>In reply, the Blaze just scraped through to 229-8, hitting the winning runs off the last ball.</p>
<p>Watkin took 3-45 from her eight overs, with the other wickets spread around four more bowlers.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it was Mitchell who was the Hinds anchor when Grant and Watkin had gone early, with Mitchell scoring 83 from 124 balls including a six and 11 boundaries.</p>
<p>Mitchell had the key partnership with Anlo van Deventer, who scored 80, to guide the Hinds to 246-5 after 50 overs.</p>
<p>But again, the Blaze ran then down, reaching 247-9 at the end of the 49th over.</p>
<p>Watkin took 3-47 from her ten overs, as well as taking a catch and getting a quick thrown into Rangi for a run out, but Wellington's final pair were able to put on 22 runs to win the game.</p>
<p>The Hinds will next play the Canterbury Magicians in a Twenty20 game at Hagley Oval in Christchurch on Monday.</p>
