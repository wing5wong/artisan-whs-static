Artistic Skater, Callista Booth-Richards has had great results at the recent New Zealand Artistic Skating Nationals in New Plymouth. 

Callista was placed first in Advanced Figures and therefore is the current National Champion for this grade.

She also came second in Youth International Dance where she had to compete in both Solo Dance and Freedance Combined. 

Overall this gives Callista the highest placings in Whanganui.

Congratulations Callista, well done!
