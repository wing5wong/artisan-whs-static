<p><strong>MVP: &nbsp;Whanganui High School goal defence Kahurangi Sturmey edged out former WHS player,&nbsp;Kaierau's, Eleanor Hogan for the Most Valuable Player honours in the Premier netball final on Monday night.</strong></p>
<p>The final of the Premier 1 Wanganui Netball championship on Monday night went into double extra time before defending champs Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau dug deepest for a two goal victory.</p>
<p>The final between Kaierau and Whanganui High School A1 repeated the scenario of the last five years and it took every ounce of experience and fitness to find the winner. The final score was 58-56 to Kaierau after a late rush from the titleholders.</p>
<p>WHS coach Lisa Murphy said she was hugely proud of her young side which included three Year 10 students, all of whom measured up throughout the season and on finals night.</p>
<p>In fact, one of her more experienced players, goal defence Kahurangi Sturmey was named Most Valuable Player of the final by guest judge and former Silver Fern Sandra Edge.</p>
<p>"It was an absolutely amazing final and I was just so proud of my girls", Murphy said.</p>
<p>"We went as underdogs after Kaierau had beaten us quite convincingly in round robin play. &nbsp;My girls produced a major turnaround from that game. &nbsp;To be honest, I think we may have taken Kaierau a bit by surprise with how hard and fast we came out".</p>
<p>"It was a real team effort, although young Montel (Vaiao Aki) played extremely well, as did Niamh Flower and Kirsten Thompson at goal keep alongside Kahurangi", Murphy said.</p>
