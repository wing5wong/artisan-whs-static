<p dir="ltr"><strong>On November 2 2018, WHS hosted its first Pasifika Awards ceremony at the Whanganui Function Centre. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The evening began with a meal of light refreshments, complimented by foods with a pacific island influence such as raw fish and coconut buns. Pastor Tamaniyaga blessed the food and after the meal we were addressed by our guest speaker, Malua Leleimalefaga. Malua is a founding member of our first Pasifika group and was instrumental in setting up the cultural values by which our students work towards today. We were very honoured that Malua and his family were able to join us for this valuable experience.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>During the evening we were treated to entertainment by Naomi and Shar Sadlier, our drummers (all ex-pasifika students) performed, AJ Malili-Malo-Lauano and Montel Vaiao Aki performed and our Pasifika students also performed their bracket.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Our achievement awards were presented first to all the students in our group to celebrate their positive participation, in our creative performances this year. These were followed by Performance and Sporting Awards presented to students who had represented the school, for at least three years, in any sporting code or performance area. Finally, Mrs. Spooner (Associate Principal) and Mr. McAllen (Principal) presented our <strong>prestigious awards to the following students;</strong></span></p>
