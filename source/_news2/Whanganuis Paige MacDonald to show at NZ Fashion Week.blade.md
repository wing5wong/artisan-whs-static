<p class="element element-paragraph">Paige MacDonald's interest in fashion design began in the sewing class at Rutherford Junior High.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now the Whanganui UCOL student is preparing to show off her work under the bright lights of New Zealand Fashion Week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">MacDonald, who is currently studying a Bachelor of Design and Arts majoring in fashion and textiles, has been selected for NZ Fashion Week's Miromoda Showcase, which includes work by established and emerging MƒÅori designers.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She earned her spot at the event, which runs from August 27 until September 2, through her runner-up placing in the Emerging Designers category in the Miromoda competition in June.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The judges thought I had good bones for a bigger collection because of the concept and how clearly the idea came across," MacDonald said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They said what I had researched was clearly shown in what I had made, which was really great to hear."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The collection, which she will expand to eight pieces for NZ Fashion Week, was inspired by an image of the Assumption of Mary.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My collection is made up of drapey, oversized clothing with a modern twist. I've got modern cuts, silhouettes, and fabrics to keep it relevant. I'm really interested in using drape and flow in my designs, contrasting it with a really tailored fit."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She said NZ Fashion Week was a great opportunity to get her name out in the fashion industry and build contacts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It would be amazing if I got some business opportunities out of it. It's about showing what I'm able to do."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After attending Rutherford Junior High, <strong>MacDonald's passion for fashion design grew at Whanganui High School where she organised the school fashion show and designed her own ball gown.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">UCOL's programme has introduced her to further new techniques and perspective.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It has really opened my eyes up. [Lecturer] Stephanie [West] has really helped me over the past three years to hone the skills I'm good at and improve everything else so I can have opportunities like being part of New Zealand Fashion Week."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">MacDonald wants to own a dress and suit-making business one day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If I ended up having the chance to supply my clothing line to shops or even running my own shop with my collections in it, I would snap up that opportunity as well. Going to Fashion Week is going to help determine what I do going forward."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">MacDonald has a Givealittle page to help raise money for material and equipment required for her NZ Fashion Week collection.
