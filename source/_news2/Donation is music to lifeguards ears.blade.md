<p>WHANGANUI lifesavers are getting a lift with the sound of music at St Mary's Church next Saturday.</p>
<p>The Lyric Singers with musicians and WHS students Ethan Mancer on euphonium and Vincent Collins on piano will present their Look at the World concert with proceeds going to support Whanganui Surf Life Saving.</p>
<p>Lyric Singers conductor and WHS teacher Joanna Love said the committee was unanimous in its decision to nominate the surf club as its chosen charity for the Christmas concert this year.</p>
<p>"They do such an essential job and we know they are not well funded," she said.</p>
<p>The Whanganui Intermediate School Choir will also be singing at the concert and Mrs Love said the rehearsals had been going brilliantly.</p>
<p>Lifeguards will begin patrolling at Castlecliff and Mowhanau beaches from December 17. Whanganui Surf Life Saving promotions officer Melanie Miller said there will be guards on duty for Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Mrs Miller said the club had received great community support this year and was delighted that the Lyric Singers had chosen to donate the proceeds from their concert this year.</p>
<p>The Look at the World concert will be held at St Mary's Church at 2pm on Saturday, November 26.</p>
<p>Entry is $15 for adults and free for children.</p>
