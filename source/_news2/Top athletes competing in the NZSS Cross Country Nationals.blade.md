<p>With over 750 competitors it is the hardest race to win in secondary school running.</p>
<p>The team of Charlotte Baker, Lauren Phillips, Jemma Tan, Nat Kirk, Morgan Murray, Cade Knight, Keane Metekingi, Blair Gowan, Flynn Johnston, Vincent Ye, Ryan Bayler, Rebecca Baker, Paris Munro, Renee Teers, Riana Tamati, Travis&nbsp;Bayler, Joseph Read, and Connor Hoskin despite having two teams in the senior grades has an average age of only 14 &frac12; so has great prospects for the future.</p>
<p>For 13 of the team its first time up at this level so it will be a huge opportunity and a learning experience.</p>
<p>Our team features five 3-person teams across the grades which is a great achievement and shows the growth of the code within the school.</p>
<p>Both the Year 9 teams have good prospects in a grade that always throws up surprises, while the Junior boys, Senior girls and Senior boy&rsquo;s teams will be looking to put down a marker for the future.</p>
<p>On an individual basis Rebecca Baker, North Island 1500 and 3000mtr track champion will be looking to crack the top 10 first time up in the senior girls and make the NZ senior girls Team which will be a huge accomplishment having only just turned 16.</p>
<p>Nat Kirk fresh off winning the N.I secondary schools 800mtrs will also be trying to make a big splash first time up in the Year 9 boys grade.</p>
<p>A huge thank you also to Elaine Baker for her superb organisation as manager of the team, Greg Fromont for his preparation of the team as coach, and to the school for its support.</p>
<p>We wish Greg, Elaine and the team all the very best!</p>
