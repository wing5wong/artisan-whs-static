Schools' end-of-year NCEA exams have been delayed 10 days by the government, to allow more time for teaching because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The government said NCEA and Scholarship exams would start on 16 November, instead of 6 November.

The change followed warnings that some students' learning had suffered during the lockdown.

The government also extended the deadline for submitting portfolios for subjects such as design to 12 November.
