<p><strong>Whanganui's Seth Reardon moves into second at the midway point of the NZXC cross country series.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui endurance rider and former WHS student Seth Reardon has moved into second place in the popular Yamaha and MotoSR-sponsored NZXC cross-country series after a solid performance in round three at Woodhill Forest an hour north of Auckland on Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 20-year-old rode solidly in the three-hour race against some tough competition finishing fourth in the Ironman, moving him into second place overall in the expert grade at the halfway point of the six-round series, an event that also doubled as the third and final round of the parallel-but-separate Motomuck Woodhill Two-Man Series.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, Aucklander Callan May has another piece of silverware for his bulging trophy cabinet.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He settled for a runner-up finish, behind friend and rival Sam Greenslade, at the weekend, and while May (Yamaha YZ250FX) was able to stretch his points advantage at the top of the senior table in the NZXC Series &ndash; after also winning the first two rounds of that competition &ndash; his runner-up finish at Woodhill on Sunday was enough for him to wrap up the outright win in the Motomuck competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Runner-up to May in the Motomuck series was fellow Yamaha rider Luke Mobberley, who finished with a 2-2-3 score-card over the three rounds.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As for the NZXC Series, May has strengthened his grip at the top of the Expert Grade standings &ndash; he is now 24 points clear of No.2 ranked rider Reardon (Yamaha) and 29 clear of the rider in third position overall, Muriwai's Mobberley.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After the racing at Matata next month, the Yamaha NZXC Series heads back to the Woodhill Forest again for round five on November 10, before it finally wraps up at Waimiha, in the King Country, on December 8.</p>
