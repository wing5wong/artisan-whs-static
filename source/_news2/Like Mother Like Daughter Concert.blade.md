<p>Ingrid Culliford and her daughter, Elena Morgan and Win Livesay and her daughter, Abigail, have a lot in common and will show it when performing in a concert together on Sunday, October 7 at 4pm at the Jane Winstone Chapel, previously known as the Sacred Heart Chapel.&nbsp; Both Elena and Abigail are former WHS students.</p>
<p>Each of them is well known in their own right. Ingrid is a flute player, Elena plays the cello, Win sings and Abigail is a piano player. They have been, or are pr<span class="text_exposed_show">ofessional musicians and Ingrid and Win taught each other&rsquo;s daughters. Win taught Elena the piano while Abigail taught her musical theory. Ingrid taught Abigail the piano.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Both of them say, &ldquo;It will be great to revive memories of playing together.&rdquo; Ingrid has accompanied Elena in a lot for concerts, especially those associated with the Wanganui Music Society. Win has sung with Abigail at weddings, funerals and for the Community Choir.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">It will be very special for the four of them to have this concert. As Win says, &ldquo;It is unlikely to happen many more times.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Both Ingrid and Win arrived in Whanganui within six months of each other and soon developed a great musical relationship. &ldquo;Ingrid kept firing music in my direction,&rdquo; says Win. They formed the music group Nahandove along with Rhianon Thomas (Now Cameron) on cello and the late Sonya Wilson on piano. The group toured New Zealand doing around 20 concerts in the late 90s.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Elena is finishing her post grad diploma in Cello at the University of Waikato and was in Whanganui recently playing as part of the Cello phonics. She is also teaching on Saturday mornings and in June was appointed as Projects Manager for Sistena Aotearoa. Based on the international El Sistema movement, Sistema Aotearoa works to bring about social change, community empowerment and personal growth for children from vulnerable communities.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Abigail accompanies Amdram, school productions and the community choir and is described by Ingrid as &ldquo;One of the most talented musical directors we&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The programme will last for over an hour without an interval. The music will be wide ranging from Telemann to Bernstein.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Tickets will be available at the door at $25 for adults, $20 for seniors and $5 for school students.</span></p>
