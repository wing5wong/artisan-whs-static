<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's Fiction Addiction have won the inaugural Manawatu Readers Cup.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They scored 9.5/10 on the final book&nbsp;<em>1918: Broken Poppies</em>&nbsp;by Des Hunt to beat Freyberg High School's Reading Salamanders by one nail-biting point.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Manawatu Readers Cup is a competition for Year 9 students in which teams of four, plus one reserve, read six books and then work as a team to answer quiz-style questions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The event has been running in Auckland for the past couple of years, this was its first venture south where 14 teams participated in the Fielding Civic Theatre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Head of English at Whanganui High School Vicki Kasner said that the competition was so new to the region that for a long time, she was not even aware of it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The lovely thing about this is that it was student driven, young Calum, he heard about it through friends and he decided to get a team together himself," Kasner said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's lovely to hear that kind of initiative coming from a year nine student."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winning team consisted of Calum Sinclair, Benjamin White, Laura Mackintosh and Toni Adams.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As well as&nbsp;<em>Broken Poppies</em>, students were required to read&nbsp;<em>Turtles all the way Down, Snow White, The Bone Sparrow, The Dawn Ride</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Traitor and the Thief.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kasner said that the competition was a wonderful idea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's getting these students to read the most recently published young adult fiction and that's exciting for them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They have a love of reading, this challenges them to read a wide variety and to work collaboratively."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reading and literacy ManawatÅ« - or ReaLM was the organiser of the event. It is currently having a cup engraved which will be handed over to the winning team soon.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Kasner said that now she is aware of the competition, Whanganui High School would be looking at getting more involved next year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"But for this year, I'm very impressed, what a lovely group of intelligent and articulate students."</p>
