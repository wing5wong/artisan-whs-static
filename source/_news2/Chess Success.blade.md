<h4>1st place at the Chess Competition&nbsp;were our A Team students.&nbsp; L-R;&nbsp; Victor Xie,&nbsp;Dekin Chadfield and Shae&nbsp;Kairau.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p><br />On Thursday 13 June the Regional Secondary School Chess Competition was being played at Whanganui Intermediate School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whanganui High School had 2 teams competing.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Our A Team students, Shae Kairau, Dekin Chadfield and Victor Xie took home 1st place!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best individual players</span>:</strong><br /><strong>Dekin Chadfield - Gold medal</strong><br /><strong>Victor Xie - Silver medal&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It came down to a close final match. We played well and are now ready to complete at the Nationals in September at Palmerston North.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chess Club is a place for players of all school levels to come and play against others, learn more about the game, and improve their strategic thinking. Students who have never played before are more than welcome, and we would be happy to teach the game to anyone interested. The club also have a few variants of chess to try out, including a 4-player free-for-all.</p>
