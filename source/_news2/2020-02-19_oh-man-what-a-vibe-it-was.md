Valentines Day was the first event on the social calendar to plan.  

It was good to see a lot of the prefects helping out the day before Valentines Day, from getting the chocolates and messages ready, to baking the cupcakes, oh and also can’t forget the best part, tasting the cupcakes.  

On Valentines Day the social prefect team gathered a team of ‘fairies’ to deliver out the chocolates and cupcakes to the students and staff.  

The Valentines Day celebration was then wrapped up by the open mic, which was planned by the amazing cultural prefect team.
