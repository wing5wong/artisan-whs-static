<p class="element element-paragraph">Four Whanganui Girl Guides have achieved the pinnacle of the organisation's awards.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jeannie Hird, Brianna Lindsay, Charlotte Hardy and Autumn Lilley received the Aoraki Award on April 10.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The Aoraki Award represents the peak of achievement and adventure as a Guide," Guide leader Donna Lindsay said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Aoraki is New Zealand's highest mountain, and the name can be translated as 'cloud piercer', so when girls complete the Aoraki Award, they will have climbed the Guide mountain."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Over a three-year period, the girls completed three endeavour badges, compulsory exploration challenge badge activities, leadership activities, two interest badges, Aoraki community challenge and camp leadership experience. They organised and ran their own overnight camp.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jeannie, 13, Brianna, 12, Charlotte Hardy, 13, and Autumn, 13, are all in Year 9 and completed the award last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All four have now moved from Guides up to Rangers, which restarted in Whanganui this year.</p>
