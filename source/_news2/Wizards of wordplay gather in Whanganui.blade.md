<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />For one word in Scrabble, 302 points is more than adequate.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And adequate is the word Lynne Butler played when setting a New Zealand record in 2011.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the most points ever awarded for a seven-letter word when Butler blew her opponent off the board at St John's Club in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Butler said she played the word at the bottom left of the board from her view.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When I was sorting through my rack I thought 'it would be nice if he played a d' and he did and I gasped. I was so excited I could hardly count," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I placed a,d,e and the q landed on the double letter. The points were multiplied by nine because it spread from one triple to the other, plus 50 for playing all my letters."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Butler will be looking to break her own record when the country's 24 best wizards of wordplay gather in Whanganui this weekend for the New Zealand Masters Tournament.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Butler is not only the 14th ranked competitor but also the director of the tournament, which last year received its first sponsor in Ryman Healthcare.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fittingly, the tournament will be held in the atrium of the retirement village and rest home operator's Jane Winstone Retirement Village.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Butler said she always played Scrabble as a kid and then, more socially, as an adult.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was living in Australia and I was working with the national organiser of Scrabble Clubs of Australia, Rhonda Palmer," Butler said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"She invited me around to her place one afternoon for a couple of games. I got there at one o'clock Saturday afternoon and I left at five o'clock Sunday morning."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That is not even the longest time Butler has spent playing Scrabble.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To celebrate the new millennium, Butler and Rosie Cleary (ranked 22 in the tournament) got dressed up and played Scrabble for 24 hours in New Plymouth.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Butler, Cleary and Andelina McLean (ranked 13) are three of 19 Whanganui Scrabble Club members who play at the Gonville Library every Monday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Competitors will be visiting the River City from as far south as Dunedin and as far north as WhangƒÅrei.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The love of Scrabble has taken Butler all over the world, including to North America in 1985, where she met the inventor of the game, Alfred Mosher Butts.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He thought we were all crazy. He never expected his game to go anywhere like it has," Butler said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To think, at that time, people would travel from Australia to Boston to play Scrabble."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The tournament begins at 8.30am this Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with play finishing at 6pm on all three days.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So if you already have a plan for this weekend, why not double up and head on down to Jane Winstone Retirement Village? You might even triple your fun.</p>
