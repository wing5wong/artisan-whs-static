<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School student Brianna Walker has won the inaugural Wynne Costley Research Scholarship.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The award was presented at a function organised by the Whanganui branch of the National Council of Women (NCW) to celebrate the 125th anniversary of women's suffrage.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wynne Costley, a long-time member of NCW, a teacher of English, Latin and French, and a staunch advocate for women, believed strongly in encouraging students to aim high academically.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The scholarship was open to all students who had completed a research assignment during the year on a New Zealand woman, or women, who has contributed or is still contributing in a distinctly definable way to society, Whanganui branch president Jenny Saywood said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Subjects chosen by the Whanganui High, Whanganui Collegiate and Whanganui Intermediate school students included Kate Sheppard, Jean Batten, Dr Emily Siedeberg and Lesley Elliot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The senior prizewinners were Brianna Walker (1), Hannah Lawler (2) and Rhian Robertson (merit) with Olivia Bedwell and Sophie Bedwell placed equal first in the junior section.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Brianna was the overall winner, receiving $500 and a trophy in addition to the $500 for winning the senior category.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If Wynne had been here she would have been thrilled to think that her branch of NCWNZ were recognising the endeavours of these bright young women," Saywood said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brianna, 17, wrote her essay about Kate Sheppard and the suffrage movement.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I thought it was a really significant event for our country," Brianna said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's really important to our history and world history in general. I'm proud that our country allowed women to have that right to vote.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was overwhelmed because I didn't think I'd win. I'm really grateful that I had the opportunity to win it because it will help a lot next year when I go to university."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Brianna will study law at Victoria University of Wellington and plans a career in criminal law.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">To acknowledge the 125th year of suffrage, NCW put together a display of Whanganui women, some relatively unknown, who were involved around the time of the suffrage movement and made a significant contribution to the Whanganui community.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Margaret Campion, who did the research, spoke at the function about some aspects of the women's work.</p>
