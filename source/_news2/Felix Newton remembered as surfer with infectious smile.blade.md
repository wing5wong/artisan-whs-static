<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui teen and former WHS student Felix Newton will be remembered as a "beautiful person" with an "infectious smile".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The 17-year-old died after crashing his ute into the Whanganui River off Victoria Ave Bridge in the early hours of Christmas Day.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His father Mike Newton told the&nbsp;<em>Herald</em>&nbsp;Felix, a keen surfer, was going to be "dearly missed".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What a beautiful person, respected by all and fearless in the water. He was one of the good guys.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We are going to miss you dearly in the surf, my son, I love you."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Boxing Day, friends and family gathered at one of Felix's old stomping grounds - the North Mole on Morgan St - for a paddle out to pay tribute to their much-loved mate.</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph">Geoff Ericsson from Wanganui Board Riders said there was a massive turnout as Newton was an all-round great guy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He was a grommet who had infectious smile and loved surfing and his local... he will be greatly missed," Ericsson said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since the tragic death, dozens have taken to social media writing tributes to their friend with a "cheeky smile".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm sure you'll still get your wave quota up there... rest in love mate," one said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another person wrote: "May you surf the clouds away rest easy Fe Fe."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Gonna miss you kid, awesome smile, cheeky grin," said another.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A police spokesman said it appeared the teen was the only occupant of the car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Inquiries into the circumstances of the crash are ongoing."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Local iwi imposed a rahui on Tuesday morning after the tragedy, covering a ban on fishing and using the river. It was lifted in a short ceremony on Thursday morning.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Police would like anyone with information to step forward and get in touch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Information can be passed on to Whanganui Police on 06 349 0600 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
