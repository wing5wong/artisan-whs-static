<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's international students invited the community to share customs and cuisine from their homelands last weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The student-driven initiative was supported by school staff and domestic students and the school kapa haka group Kia Whaiora opened the international dance performances in the hall on Saturday night.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">International student director Alex Ferreti said there was a full house on the night and students served a lot of "beautiful food".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The groups performed amazing traditional as well as modern dances and the audience loved it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We wrapped up at around 9.30 and the students deserve high praise for a very successful night."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Japanese students performed a traditional fishing dance, as well as a modern J-Pop piece. Ferreti said South Korean students also performed a contemporary dance known as K-Pop.</p>
