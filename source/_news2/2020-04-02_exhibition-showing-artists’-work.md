A lot of work went into Whanganui Arts Society’s Artists Open Studios exhibition and they’re hoping it will not be wasted.

All galleries have been instructed to close under the Level 4 Covid-19 alert, but the Cooks Gallery exhibition can be viewed on line through their Facebook page.

“It’s a wonderful exhibition,” says committee member Judy Webby.

“We’ve got some new people like Claire Gibney and Bruce Tonkin.”

Bruce is a photographer and Claire specialises in ceramics and craft, with some unusual resin pieces. With the gallery divided into display bays, Claire and Bruce share a bay, showing a marked variation in light and dark, colour and style.

“There are 120 pieces at least on show,” says Judy.

Beverley Rae comes from Auckland and she is showing her oil paintings in Cooks Gallery.

“She was a year behind me at Elam (Fine Arts College in Auckland),” says Judy.

She says the work presented ranges from developments of a number of styles in acrylic, oils, water colour, drawing, with many different themes — landscape, portraits, still life — as well as tapestry work, quilting and more.

Regular Arts Society exhibitors are well represented with artists including Richard and Doreen Cotgrove, Ropiha Paul Bevan, Lynette Lyne, Jan

Arnold, Stephanie Lockwood, Joanna Ginn, Lorraine Halliwell and Judy Webby displaying a vast body of new and varied work. Artist Gilly Brown has created a large quilt with a gecko design.

“She’s done everything by hand,” says Judy.

Judy’s own work consists of large, rugged, mountainous landscapes, places she has been to. Her broad brush strokes and use of colour suit her subject matter.

Lorraine Halliwell’s watercolours are in a class of their own.

“She learned from a lady who was at art school when I was there,” says Judy. “Ernestine Maddox, well known in Auckland. Beverley Rae learned from Ernestine as well.”

Judy says this exhibition is one of their best and attributes that to the new members of the society.

Work can be viewed on the Whanganui Arts Society Facebook page.
