The start of summer will see a new youth-focused festival launched in Whanganui’s town centre.

Whanganui District Council’s Youth Committee is working with other local agencies to stage the Hinengaro Rangatahi Festival at Majestic Square on Victoria Avenue and Maria Place on Friday, 13 December 2019 from 4.00pm until about 8.00pm.

Whanganui District Council’s Youth Committee Project Support Officer, Nicole Grey says, “One of the Youth Committee’s key tasks is to improve the wellbeing of young people in our area by giving them more opportunities to get involved.

“Hinengaro will appeal to a broad range of young people because it offers a diverse mix in the way of music and activities.”

The festival will include a basketball competition, games and art activities, food deals at Mint and Little C and music from local bands **Ocean Loaf**, City College Band, **Ra Costello, Rhythm Vision, InBusiness and DRXNES.** Prizes will be given out on the day.

The Hinengaro Rangatahi Festival is a twist on the Youth Committee’s vibe festival. Like vibe, Hinengaro has a mental health focus and this year interactive hauora or health and wellbeing activities will be offered to festivalgoers.

“Don’t miss out – make sure you find the Hinengaro event on Facebook and invite your friends, it’s going to be a great party,” Nicole Grey says.
