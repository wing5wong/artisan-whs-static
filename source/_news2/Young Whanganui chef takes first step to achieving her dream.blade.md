<p><strong>Emma Russell continues her series charting the stories of former Whanganui students who have gone on to success in the big, wide world.</strong></p>
<p>A WHANGANUI graduate is taking her first step towards one day opening her own bakery in town.</p>
<p>Hannah Cairncross completed her professional cookery diploma at UCOL last year and has since begun working for Compass Group New Zealand at Mars Petcare on Whanganui's Heads Rd.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old is employed as a part-time catering assistant but will transition into full-time employment as she gains more experience.</p>
<p>"I've learnt all sorts of new skills and increased my knowledge about certain foods like sushi, which I had never touched before this job."</p>
<p>Miss Cairncross said her passion for food stemmed from her family, who had been a huge inspiration.</p>
<p>"My mum is a great cook and my dad has always grown delicious fresh produce for us to use in dishes at home," she said.</p>
<p>"My great aunt is also a chef and has always encouraged and supported me."</p>
<p>The former Whanganui High School student said she had always loved cooking but it wasn't until she completed the school's Gateway programme in her final year that she knew for sure that she was going to pursue a career in food.</p>
<p><span>"For three days of the week I would attend school as per normal, while one day of the week I would get some work experience and the other day I would spend at U-skills."</span></p>
<p>U-Skills provides secondary school students with the opportunity to attend UCOL one day each week developing abilities relevant to a particular industry.</p>
<p>"At U-Skills I learnt basic vegetable cuts, how to make coffee and so on ... basically skills that gave me a head start in my qualification."</p>
<p>While still at school she gained work experience at the Rutland Arms in the bakery section, Lakeview Cafe and Bar as the dishwashing assistant and at the Kiwiana cafe.</p>
<p>There were 60 people enrolled in the diploma course when she started, but only eight by the time she had finished her two years.</p>
<p>For students considering a career in cookery, Miss Cairncross recommended sticking it out because it is so nice to be busy in a real working kitchen.</p>
