<p><span>ON SONG: Kerwyn Morgan (pictured earlier in the season) gave Wanganui High School impetus in a tight game against Kaierau on Monday night.</span></p>
<p>It was a one-point thriller worthy of a grand-final. Phillips Electrical Wanganui High School clinched victory over Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau in the dying seconds of their Premier 1 netball clash on Monday night.</p>
<p>The 51-50 win means High School finish the round-robin on top of table heading into next week's semi-final.</p>
<p>Coach Lisa Murphy was delighted with her team's performance, noting it was about the "top two inches" and showed they were capable of winning under pressure. Murphy believed it was a complete team effort right through the court.</p>
<p>Kaierau started strongly with tight defence forcing a number of turnovers they were able to capitalise on and with goal shoot Suzanne Guilford shooting 100 per cent and crafty goal attack Te Reo Paki netting eight from nine, they led 16-12 at the first quarter break.</p>
<p>Connections on attack broke down in the second quarter for Kaierau and a superb defensive effort from High School's Taliah Su'a and Leila Blackburn restricted Guilford to four attempts.</p>
<p>Su'a and Blackburn contested the ball strongly and were well supported by wing defence Kahurangi Sturmey picking up ball on the circle edge. High School went to half-time leading 29-25.</p>
<p>The speed, timing and drive to the ball through court and off the centre pass particularly from wing attack Kerwyn Morgan and centre De-ann Tyrell was on point for the school side and there was some superb ball placement into the goal circle. Renee Butler managed to draw defenders to open up space for herself and her feeders to find captain Sam Murphy. Murphy was again impressive at goal shoot taking High School into the final quarter up 40-35.</p>
<p>Kaierau made a number of changes for the final spell with Paki moving to goal defence to pair up with Kelera Kuruyabaki who impressed with her infamous intercepts. Mel Crothers switched to wing defence with Amy Archer moving to wing attack and Jackie Abraham on into goal attack. The changes worked as they picked up two turnovers to help them level the score with five minutes left.</p>
<p>It remained goal-for-goal and with 20 seconds left, High School had the centre pass and calmly found Murphy who slotted the winning goal on the bell.</p>
<p>The two sides may well meet again in the final, an exciting prospect for fans.</p>
<p>In Monday's semifinals Kaierau take on EC Sports while High School face Mint Cafe Marist A1.</p>
<p>While in the bottom-four semifinals Collegiate will take on Kaiwhaiki while Cullinane will play Ruapehu.</p>
