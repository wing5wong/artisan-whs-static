The success of the Paul Road Music Festival continues and it will be running for the 12th year on Sunday, March 8. It’s time to put it in your diary of music events to attend.

Organiser, Fred Loveridge says there will be seven bands including the popular local band ‘Hot Potato,’ ‘Brilleaux,’ an original, 4 piece, British-style rhythm and blues band from Tauranga and of course Fred’s well known group ‘Whiskey Mama.’
It is always a relaxed afternoon/evening of bands playing out in the ‘front garden.’ You bring your own seats, drinks and provide your own shade with BBQ food available to purchase.

Tickets cost $20 and will be available from February 1 from the Gatshack. All the proceeds go to Gabby’s Starlit Hope Charity to help Whanganui families with sick children. The charity was started by 13 year old Gabby Devine, who experienced first-hand the harsh treatment required in the battle against cancer. Her vision was to provide random acts of kindness to children in hospital especially cancer children and their parents and families.

Sadly Gabby passed away in May 2015. Her achievements have led her to win many awards including a National Youth award for giving back and being the Taranaki Daily News Person of the Year in 2016.

Fred is also going to be involved in another concert at Caroline’s for St Patrick’s Day, Tuesday, March 17. There will be three bands including two Irish Celtic bands with one called ‘Rakes of the Gale’ from Palmerston North. The show will be from 5.30pm to 10pm.
