<p>MUD PACK: WHS student Oliver Dennison left the pack in his wake to claim the lead in the Wanganui Motorcycle Club's flat track series after two wins and a second in the mud on Sunday.</p>
<p>Thirteen-year-old rider Oliver Dennison relished the mud to claim the Junior 125cc class in round two of the Wanganui Motorcycle Club's flat track series on Sunday.</p>
<p>Riding his Husqvarna 125cc, Dennison simply loved the mud and was almost unbeatable in the wet getting a second in the first motocross. But no one could catch him in the second and third races as he pulled away to victory on the Maxwell track.</p>
<p>One hundred riders competed in what started a dry track before deteriorating throughout the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dennison now leads his class after solid efforts in round one where he kept in touch with the pack on a rain-affected surface.</p>
<p>The third and final round is on November 14 at a venue yet to be confirmed.</p>
