<p><strong>LIFE at Whanganui High School</strong></p>
<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following on from our Open Day afternoon and evening held on Thursday, 14 June, I would like to remind all families that enrolment applications for study at Whanganui High School should be returned to the School by Friday, 6 July.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Winter sport competitions are well under way, with considerable sporting success being achieved in all our sporting codes across many nights of the week and on weekends.&nbsp; I greatly appreciate the commitment and dedication shown by many parents, staff members and senior students as they freely give up their own personal time to support, coach, and manage our teams.&nbsp; Thank you for upholding our LIFE values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>School highlights in the last few weeks have included:&nbsp; Chess Tournament; Tough Guy/Gal Challenge; Cultural Week; Year 13 Geography trip to the Gold Coast; Orienteering and Tramping Trips, Chamber Music successes, Rock Quest successes; Mountain biking trips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also looking forward to our home sports exchange with Hutt Valley High School on 19 June; our away sports exchange to New Plymouth Girls High School on 27 June; our International Cultural Festival this Saturday; Manu korero and Paerangatahi (Waitara) on 21 and 22 June; Performing Arts assessment evenings; Bush Craft and mountain biking trips, Hillary Challenge activities; Year 9 and 10 Speech competitions; and the NZ Secondary Schools Cross Country Championships this weekend.</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui</p>
