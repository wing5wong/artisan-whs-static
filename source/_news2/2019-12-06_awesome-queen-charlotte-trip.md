We set off to Porirua for the start of our trip on Friday 30 November with 17 students and 4 staff members.  

An early start on Saturday to meet the Interislander ferry at 8.45am.  We arrive in Picton and made our way to the water taxi for the mail run throughout the Sound.  Our starting point was Ships Cove where we arrived at 3.30pm.  Our first night was School House Bay, lots of swimming then dinner.  

Day 2 we walked to Camp Bay, 7 hours later!  

Day 3 was a big walk to Black Rock Shelter, 6 hours.  Heaps of wind and rain.  

Day 4 was very wet and we got soaked, but we made it to Davies Bay by 4pm and the sun came out.  

Our final morning on Wednesday 4 December started at 5am.  We walked to Anakiwa and all jumped off the jetty. Our water taxi picked us up at 8am back to Picton, then the Interislander ferry to Wellington.  We were picked up at Wellington and made our way back to Wanganui by 5pm.

A great trip, outstanding effort, well done to all students!
