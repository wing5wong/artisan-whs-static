<p>ALL DECKED OUT: &nbsp;Wanganui High School in their new uniforms, provided by funding from Pub Charity.</p>
<p>The banks of the Whanganui River were lined once again with tents and teenagers on Saturday for a busy running of the Wanganui School Championships.</p>
<p>Four Wanganui region secondary schools were joined by competitors from a further 12 schools for 45 races on the river, starting with the sculling heats in the morning, then continuing with the finals and the coxed races in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Bringing the biggest and strongest group of local entrants, Wanganui High School came away with eleven victories in the A Finals.</p>
<p>They also got 10 runner-up spots and six third placings.</p>
<p>As expected, Jessica Brougham and Kayla Spencer were too strong as a team in the Girls Under 18 double sculls and the coxless pair.</p>
<p>Nathan Luff had a profitable day on the water, winning the Under 18 single, being part of winning double scull with Adam Wadey, and then the two of them were part of the coxed quad sculls team win with Harry Lillington, Guy Thomson and cox Jack Clark.</p>
<p>Matthew Wright and Brodie Manson won the Under 17 double sculls, then teamed with Cameron Lawrence, Ben Tijsen-Cox and Niamh Mullany (cox) for Under 17 coxed-quad sculls victory. Nga Tawa Diocesan School were very strong in the coxed eight events, as predominantly the same crew of girls, with the odd age group substitution, finished runners-up in the Under 16, 17 and 18 finals.</p>
<p>The school also earned a third placing in the Girls Under 16 double sculls.</p>
<p>Cullinane College's best effort was the runner-up position in the Boys Under 15 coxed quad sculls, plus two thirds in the Girls Under 17 singles and coxless pair.</p>
<p>Wanganui Collegiate secured thirds from their Girls Under 15 in both the coxed four and the eight, while Wanganui Girls College picked up a third placing in the Under 16 coxed four.</p>
