<p>The Whanganui High School Touch team is busy training and raising funds to go to an international Tournament in Brisbane in October. It is the biggest tournament of its type in the world with 420 teams. It runs over five days and teams will play an average of three games a day.</p>
<p>The team, which is coached by Physical Education Teacher/Dean, Sean Brown, consists of 15 girls from year 9 to year 12. Of t<span class="text_exposed_show">his team, 12 were selected for the Under 17 Girls Maori Touch team representing Te Atihaunui-a- Paparangi which played at the NZ Maori Touch Nationals in Rotorua and winning the championship.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Sean himself, has represented New Zealand in Touch attending four World Cup events and was the Whanganui Coach of the Year in 2016.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The school has made the NZ Secondary Schools Mixed final four years in a row from 2013-2016 winning Gold twice.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Sean says &ldquo;in the past it has always been about winning.&rdquo; However this time round, although winning is important to the team, the goal is to develop self-confident young women, who have the skills to become anything they put their minds to. Another key goal is teaching them the values of team work and contributing to a team environment.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">As Sean says &ldquo;Sport is an amazing vehicle to teach young students about values that make them a better person within the community.&rdquo; The Australian tour will give these girls a life opportunity they may never have got.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The manager of the team is Fiona Bryant and among her huge responsibilities is the need to think of different fund raisers to help reduce the estimated cost of $3000 each for everyone that goes.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><strong>They will be hosting a Fundraising Hypnotist Show on May 24 and 25 at the Whanganui High School Hall. Tickets for this family orientated show are $20 and can be purchased via Fiona or Team members.</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Fiona says, &ldquo;We are currently seeking sponsorship also for our team members to travel to Australia. If a business or organisation is interested, please contact me on 027 6629658.<br /></span></p>
