<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School (WHS) scholarship students are reaping the rewards as they take their next step in the big wide world.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On Wednesday three of the seven Year 13 students from last year were able to attend a morning tea in the WHS staff room to celebrate their achievements.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">For high school graduate <strong>Boston Flanagan-Connors</strong> 10 exams in three weeks was "no sweat".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Boston said he had six regular exams and then four scholarship exams on top - each three hours long.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It was pretty intense but really rewarding at the same time. Knowing that all your hard work has paid off feels pretty good."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The 18-year-old was awarded scholarships for history, statistics and classics and will receive $6000 over the three years of his study.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As he heads down to Victoria University to study a bachelor in law and commerce, that money will help pay for his accommodation.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Classmate <strong>Vincent Collins, 18, scored a statistics scholarship and received $500 which will help him as he heads down to Victoria University to study a bachelor of physics and international relations.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Vincent said he went for four scholarships and got the one he least expected to get.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm pretty pleased. I went for heaps to see if I would get any and I did so I'm happy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Another classmate, <strong>Alister Hughes</strong>, <strong>17, took the cake with a quadruple scholarship.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>His four scholarships were physical education, English, geography and statistics.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Alister will also be going to Victoria University to study law and sociology and was awarded $6000 over three years.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think I'll be saving the money for when I go flatting and the student life really begins to kick in."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS principal Martin McAllen said the level of competition for these scholarships were huge and these students had done outstanding work.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They are students with clear goals and who will go far. Let's just hope they come back to Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The Year 13 scholarship students who didn't attend were Jesse Satherley for chemistry, physics, calculus; Angus James for history; Danielle Thompson for history; and Hugo Collins for classics.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Mr McAllen said overall he was very pleased with the performance of all the NCEA level 1, 2 and 3 students.</p>
