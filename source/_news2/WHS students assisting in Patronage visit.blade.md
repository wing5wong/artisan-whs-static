<p class="element element-paragraph">Dame Patsy Reddy has continued to work her way around Whanganui following the investiture of Dame Tariana Turia at PÅ«tiki Marae on Tuesday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Along with husband Sir David Gascoigne, they first visited Gonville Library where she read&nbsp;<em>Kapai and the Kauri Trees</em>&nbsp;to children from Castlecliff's Barsanti Kindergarten.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Next on the itinerary was a trip to Pacific Helmets on Heads Road and then she made her way to First Vets in support of Kotuku Foundation Assistance Animals Aotearoa (KFAAA).</p>

<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />"I'm a patron of this particular charity. That arose when the founder of the patron Merenia Donne came to government house for her own investiture earlier this year," Dame Patsy said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><span>"She knew of our particular love of dogs and interest in therapy dogs."</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Inside the clinic on Glasgow Street, Donne made a presentation on her work with KFAAA, which makes assistance dogs affordable and available to those that need them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Following the presentation, there was a dog zen training demonstration performed by experienced dog trainer Mark Vette.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dame Patsy said that she learned a lot on the day, such as the prime time for training dogs being when they are between two and four months old.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've just pointed out that with our poodle, who's now 10, we may have missed the boat, but [Mark] did assure me that you can teach old dogs new tricks so hopefully that's the case.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think it's remarkable work, I'm sure it's very intensive training though because they're such specialised skills those dogs need to look after people with medical conditions."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At 9am today, Dame Patsy will be at the opening of the New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy, followed by a trip to RNZAF Base Ohakea at 10.30.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dame Patsy said she does regional visits every few months and was really interested to see what is going on in Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There's a real community spirit here, there are lots of people that are engaged in supporting the community and each other.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"And entrepreneurial spirit too, whether it's the Pacific Helmets or the Glassworks, they're actually making businesses that are unique to Whanganui."</p>
