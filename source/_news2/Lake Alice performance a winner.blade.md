<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>At the end of the performance, everyone froze.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Doctors and nurses were in a waltz pose as if everything was la-dee-da, while patients were reaching out to the audience in despair.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The projector kept rolling, showing old news clippings with headlines such as 'Lake Alice exposed for mistreatment'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui High School's Stage Art performers walked off the Regent on Broadway stage in Palmerston North and awaited judging.</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">They won.</h3>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their performance was called&nbsp;<em>Uncovering Alice</em>&nbsp;and it was all about Lake Alice Hospital, a former rural psychiatric facility in Rangitikei.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">WHS dance teacher Olivia Reuters said that when researching the facility, they came across a story about a young Niuean boy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He was put into Lake Alice because of his behavioural issues, when really, he just couldn't speak English," Reuters said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They could write letters home, but they were censored by the staff and if they said anything about what was happening there, they had to re-write it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He wrote a letter saying that he was having a jolly time, he drew a picture with it and in a speech bubble he wrote in Niuean that he was getting electroshock therapy which was painful."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The boy was&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=224779" target="_blank">Hakeaga Halo</a></strong>, his grandmother received the letter in Auckland and Lake Alice hospital was exposed.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The government wrote a letter of apology in 2001 for the abuse that occurred there in the 1970s and it has paid out more than $10m in compensation to almost 200 former patients.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A former Whanganui High School student, Reuters said the event was the highlight of her first year teaching there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Stage Art was time-consuming, but if it's something you love, then you've got no problem pouring your time into it and giving it your all," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"When you're doing a topic like that, you're naturally interested in the performance, which gives you an energy and enthusiasm that seems to be contagious."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Stage Art is in its first year and was started by Dean McKerras of DanceNZ Made following the announcement that Stage Challenge would not run in 2018.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There were almost 100 students involved in the production and all of the arts departments contributed something, from music to visual effects.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">All of the Stage Art performances were filmed and will be shown to a panel of judges to determine the winner of the national final.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You don't actually get to perform it again, which is a real shame because it would be great if we could," Reuters said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It brings joy to everyone, performing uses a different part of the brain and it definitely builds confidence, I've seen that."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The performance opened with a girl reading a letter, before being taken away by nurses and shocked by a doctor.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reuters said that despite the heavy theme, they still managed to incorporate an upbeat scene depicting patients with their families before being taken to the hospital.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">When the judges announced Whanganui High School as the winners, Reuters said it was music to her ears.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I felt on top of the world, when you throw everything into four weeks, you're thinking about it when you fall asleep and again when you wake up.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"To get such a reward was amazing."</p>
