Good afternoon everyone,

 

I have very sad news.  I am now able to tell our wider school community of the tragically unexpected and sudden passing away of Kahu Miller (Year 13 – Maunga House) last Tuesday.  I have spoken to both Kahu’s mother and father – they are very appreciative of the sincere condolences and positive support from students and staff at Whanganui High School over the last few days.  Kahu will be missed deeply by many students and staff throughout our entire school community.

 

Kahu was laid to rest at Kelvin Grove Cemetery, Palmerston North last Saturday under COVID-19 restrictions.  Kahu’s family has asked us to please keep Kahu’s friendship and positivity in our memories.  A tribute service in Kahu’s memory will be held at a future date – Whanganui High School students and staff will be able to participate in the service.

 

Our two full-time guidance counsellors (Jacqui McKenzie and Terry Tubman) have been remote counselling Kahu’s closest friends and classmates since last Tuesday.  Please email Jacqui and Terry at mckenzie.j@whs.ac.nz and tubman.t@whs.ac.nz if you require counselling help or further support.

 

Rest in peace Kahu.
