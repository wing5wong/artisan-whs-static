Tēnā koutou katoa,

During the last few weeks we have completed a full range of Awards afternoons and evenings:  Sports Awards; Pasifika Awards; Arts and Cultural Awards; Maori Awards; Year 11 Prizegiving; Year 12 Prizegiving; Year 13 Prizegiving.  We warmly congratulated all prize winners and thanked all students who had consistently put in full sustained effort throughout 2019. Our senior students have recently begun their external NCEA assessments and our Year 9 and Year 10 students have just completed their school examinations in English, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies.

At the same time, the very busy life of our school continues:  Current Year 8 students will be assessed and involved in welcoming transition and familiarisation processes into Whanganui High School as part of their preparation for joining us in 2020; Transition priority meetings will be held with relevant current Year 8 students and their whānau/teachers; Bronze and Silver Duke of Edinburgh student and staff trips will depart and return; Supported learning field trips will occur; Central Six Junior sports tournament will be held; all Junior students will participate fully in our wide-ranging Activities Week areas of focus; normal timetabled classes will generally continue until the end of the school year for students.

Our school breathes and lives our LIFE values:  Learning, Integrity, Fellowship, Excellence.  Check out our school website www.whanganuihigh.school.nz for more details.

I am always happy to meet with students, whānau and members of the community to discuss any aspect of education at Whanganui High School.

Ngā mihi nui,
