Tranzit have informed WHS about some bus cancellations, due to reduced staffing availability following the government advice this weekend on those who should stay home.

This is effective immediately, so these buses will not run on Monday: Turakina secondary, Kaiwhaiki, Waverley, Wylies bridge/Mangamahu, Ratana, Brunswick, Westmere.  

... as of 24 March the Maxwell/Waitotara bus will also not be running.

Buses that are still running:  
Fordell (but not the Wylies bridge/Mangamahu connection minibus).
