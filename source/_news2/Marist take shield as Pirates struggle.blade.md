<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Dave Hoskin Carriers Marist narrowly defeated Waverley Harvesting Border 27-25 for the Grand Hotel Challenge Shield at Dallison Park in Waverley on Saturday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In round two of Tasman Tanning Premier rugby, one try made the difference for Marist with <strong>Simon Dibben</strong>,<strong> Josaia Bogileka</strong>, Emitai Logadraudrau and Jack Yarrall dotting down.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A penalty goal and two conversions by Marist's Ashton Coates were enough to get his team home as Border scored through Jason Myers, Josh Lennox and Neihana Pomana.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Two penalties and two conversions from Border's Nick Harding left the men from Waverley two points behind at the end and sitting three places off the bottom of the table.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, at Spriggens Park, Wanganui Car Centre Kaierau crushed 2018 grand finalists Black Bull Liqour Pirates 48-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Fafetetai Siona and <strong>Matt Ashworth</strong> each scored two tries for Kaierau while teammates <strong>Kohlt Coveney, Joe Edwards, Ethan Robinson</strong> and Sieko Kilisi all got one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Shandon Scott successfully struck three conversions, while Josefa Rokotakaia also kicked one to finish a 31-point scoring second half for Kaierau.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The loss leaves Pirates second from the bottom of the table and still pointless in 2019.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">At Memorial Park in Taihape it was another high-scoring thrashing as Byford's Readimix Taihape put 56 on the board to Round Motors Ratana's 0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tyler Rogers-Holden and Dylan Gallien had games to remember for Taihape, each scoring three tries while Dane Whale also came close to a hat-trick, scoring two.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Tremaine Gilbert and Ryan Karatau also dotted down for Taihape, while Whale also kicked two conversions and Jaye Flaws one.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The early rounds have been challenging for bottom placed Ratana who have scored only three points in two games with 147 scored against them.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In senior championship action Speirs Food Marton beat Black Bull Liqour Pirates 55-7, Kelso Hunterville overcame Marist Buffalo's 39-17, Waverley - Marist Celtic hammered Border 62-14, Kaiwhaiki &ndash; Utiku OB edged out Counties 24-12 and Bennett's Taihape took out Kaierau 34-23 for the Stihl Shop Wanganui Challenge Shield.</p>
