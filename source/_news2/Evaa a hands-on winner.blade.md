<p class="element element-paragraph">Eva Harkness (f<span>ormer WHS student),&nbsp;</span>was prepared to tough it out for however long it took. Turns out it took 38-and-a-half hours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui student won Ucol Whanganui's "hand on car competition" early on Sunday morning after two sleepless nights.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Seventeen Ucol students began the competition at 7pm on Friday, with contestants placing a hand on a car outside the Whanganui campus.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The last to take their hand away won a 2005 Ford Fiesta.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've always been about challenging myself like that," Harkness said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was this characteristic and the fact she has "a Toyota Corolla that's definitely not going to pass its next warrant" that led Harkness to enter.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">She read online about hand on car competitions and contacted the winner of the last New Zealand one for tips.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm a firm believer in if you fail to prepare you prepare to fail," Harkness said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I definitely mentally prepared for it and I was determined to go to Tuesday if I had to. I had it in my head that it was going to be long."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It got easier as people dropped off and by the early hours of Sunday morning it was down two - Harkness and Heather Leeves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Leeves checked out at about 9.30am when reaching for her jacket - one of only two to accidentally take their hand away.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think I was just really upset for Heather," Harkness said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Both of them were just determined and fun and good to be around. You go through the same thing together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Contestants were only allowed a 15-minute break every four hours.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"You could literally go to the toilet, sort out what you're going to eat and maybe sit down for a bit and then you're back. It was always quite rushed, it never really felt like a break."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Harkness said it was her mindset which got her through.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I've thought about this for a long time and I never really doubted that I could do it and I think that's kind of key.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Even the strongest give up and I remember thinking that quite a bit, even though I really wanted the other people to succeed as well obviously there can only be one winner."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Surprisingly the second night of no sleep was easy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Maybe your body gets used to the rhythm, and people dropping out, you get closer and closer," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"So, it just got easier and easier really which is kind of backwards to how I thought it would be."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">If anything, she said the hardest part emotionally was seeing her family's support.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's kind of the most family I'd seen in one place for a while. They were all doing things for me and I felt really appreciative and I felt hot and cold and tired and dizzy and I just really wanted to go home with them."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Runner-up Leeves said it was an awesome challenge.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's mentally hard to push through. When you are in it your kind of fighting your own need to do certain things."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ucol Whanganui campus manager Bronwyn Paul said the competition was part of the institution's 10-year celebration, with Wanganui Motors donating the car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm just really proud of Eva and Heather. It's not easy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As for Harkness, she had other plans before getting behind the wheel of her new car.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I think I'm going to have spa and a mulled wine and a sleep."</p>
