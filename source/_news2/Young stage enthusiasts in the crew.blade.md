<p class="element element-paragraph">Jamie O'Hagan and Reid Tucker are two young men assisting with the production of Repertory Theatre's next offering&nbsp;<em>Ringing the Changes</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both of them have already been involved in Rep's productions before and have enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I just love everything about it," Reid says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The theatre people help me get through the hard times and I do enjoy seeing a play come together."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Reid's not on stage this time as he's assistant stage manager and will be organising the backstage crew. He's also been helping Phil Hudson with building the set, just as he did for&nbsp;<em>The Pohutukawa Tree</em>,&nbsp;<em>Middle Age Spread</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jamie O'Hagan is on stage playing the part of the youngest member of the MacArthur family, Richard.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's quite mischievous, likes to play practical jokes and does a lot of sneaky things behind his father's back, encouraged by his grandmother.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"He's Grandma's favourite and she spoils him. He's close to her and he does a lot with her," Jamie says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">This will be Jamie's second play with Repertory Theatre. Last year he was in&nbsp;<em>The Pohutukawa Tree</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's good playing Richard because in&nbsp;<em>The Pohutukawa Tree</em>&nbsp;I was a bad guy, but this time I'm playing a funny, kind, good guy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In his final year at Cullinane College Jamie is studying dance and drama but dreams of doing something quite different. He dreams of getting into wrestling school for TV entertainment. I'd never heard of it but he assured me it wasn't like sumo wrestling &mdash; no nappies!</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's highly competitive and hard to get into."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">One can only wish these two young men the best for the future. In the meantime Repertory Theatre is lucky to have them on board.</p>
