<p class="element element-paragraph">A music video by Whanganui reggae band NLC is getting a lot of love online this month and songwriter Baz Muir is thrilled about it.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Muir is the founder, lead singer and guitarist of NLC (No Limits Crew), a pool of musicians who first got together in Whanganui six years ago but now live in different cities.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We come together to play live but this latest recording is just me," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Say Goodbye</em>&nbsp;was filmed around Whanganui at Kowhai Park, Virginia Lake and Castlecliff Beach and features aspiring young actor Ethan Smith.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Filmed and edited by Muir and his partner Rita Phillips, the video is a mini-movie of love going wrong and coming right again. Muir's sister Mitch plays Smith's love interest.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is one of a dozen NLC videos on YouTube and each one tells a story.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Dylan Thorby-Reid was recruited for&nbsp;<em>Love Not War</em>&nbsp;and says the experience gave him a "massive confidence boost."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I had to run towards the camera and get shot.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I really hurt my back when I landed but it was such a good experience."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Muir says he enjoys giving young people opportunities to shine and seeing their confidence grow.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Sometimes I want to deliver messages with my songs and others are about love for whanau and friends," he says.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">NLC is a whanau affair. Muir's adult daughter Shaye is a band member as well as a solo performer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Muir and Phillips have a baby daughter Sharlisa, who appears in the&nbsp;<em>Say Goodbye</em>video.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The band were finalists in the 2017 Waiata Maori Music Awards and were nominated for the Best Maori Urban Roots/Reggae Album award for their second album&nbsp;<em>Love not War.</em></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It will be nice if we get nominated again this year," says Muir.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The ceremony in Hastings last year was an awesome event."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>Say Goodbye</em>&nbsp;is to be included on NLC's third album which Muir says he has not yet named.</p>
