<p>It's summer tournament week again for the North Island secondary schools and Whanganui High School will be in the thick of it with ten teams heading away to compete.</p>
<p>Starting on Monday, the NZ Aon Maadi Cup Regatta gets underway on Lake Karapiro in Cambridge, and the leading hope in the WHS rowing squad is Under 16 singles competitor Niamh Monk, who will be hoping to get back on the podium after earning bronze at the North Island Secondary School champs two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The WHS boys and girls softball teams head to Wellington for the Division 2 championships, while two squads are off to Taupo for the Ultimate Frisbee competition.</p>
<p>Senior boys and girls teams will go to Palmerston North for games, while two WHS squads will be at the 3x3 basketball tournament in Tauranga.</p>
<p>Also, the WHS waka ama group heads to Rotorua's Blue Lake for the Te WƒÅnanga o Aotearoa National Secondary School championships.</p>
<p>WHS sport co-ordinator Lisa Murphy said the teams would not be going without the support and dedication from all their volunteer coaches, managers and parents, who have worked with them to get ready and will be going alongside them to all those locations.</p>
