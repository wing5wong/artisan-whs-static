<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of last term brought significant success to Sophia &lsquo;Unga-Cribb when she won the Junior English section of the national Nga Manu Korero competition in Gisborne.&nbsp; The Whanganui High School band &lsquo;The Remnant&rsquo; (Cypress Kani-Hurinui, Wiremu Rogan, Toka Poa, Joshua Waitai and Chester Nevil) also recorded national finalist success at the Smokefree Tangata Beats competition in Auckland.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks we have had two student groups representing Whanganui High School on significant trips overseas.&nbsp; Twenty-seven students across all year levels and three staff members (Beck Ding, Lynaire Simon and Lee Su&rsquo;a) travelled on a sixteen-day trip via Beijing and the Great Wall to one of our overseas sister schools in Xuzhou, China.&nbsp; This experience was positively enriching and life-changing for all our students and staff members.</p>
<p>Our second recent overseas trip involved our female touch team &ndash; led by staff member Sean Brown - competing in a huge touch competition involving more than 400 teams in Brisbane, Queensland.&nbsp; Our Whanganui High School team made the top 16 stage of the competition before, unfortunately for all competitors and supporters, terrible weather in Brisbane led to the cancellation of the last two days of the competition.</p>
<p>Over the next three Thursday evenings we will hold our Sports Awards evening, our Arts Award evening and our Māori Awards evening.&nbsp; Immediately after these evenings we will head towards the Year 11 Prizegiving, the Year 12 Prizegiving and then the Year 13 Prizegiving and supper.</p>
<p>Our Senior students will begin their NCEA external examinations on Wednesday, 7 November and will have completed their examinations by Friday, 30 November.&nbsp; Junior examination week begins on Friday, 9 November and runs &ndash; alongside normal classes &ndash; until Friday, 16 November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ngā mihi nui,<br />Martin McAllen<br />Principal<br />Whanganui High School</p>
