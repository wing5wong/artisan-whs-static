<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>An anti-bullying film by a group of Whanganui students has won a national competition.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong><em>Friends</em>&nbsp;was made by Whanganui High School's head boy Jack Southee and deputy head boy Nusr Ghamri, along with the school's student council.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>The students made the film as part of Bullying-Free Week, at the end of May, and won first prize in the New Zealand Bullying-Free Week senior short film competition.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In their notes on the film, the judging panel said they had been "inundated with entries - the standard was very high".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But the judges said the Whanganui High School film was "refreshing".</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"[It] was an outstanding short film with a clear, positive and uplifting message ... [it] was led by student voices, and produced to a high professional standard."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack said the film came about when the school's student council was brainstorming ideas for Bullying-Free week.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We want to spread a positive message. We wanted to focus on how students should behave, rather than how they shouldn't."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">So the filmmakers picked out fellow students at random, sat them in front of a camera and asked them three questions: What do you like about school? What makes a good friend? What makes a bad friend?</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We know the goal of school is academic achievement, but social interaction is a big appeal for students," Nusr said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We were hoping to get people to think about their own behaviour, and how they'd like to act as a friend."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The film was shown at school assemblies during Bullying-Free Week, and then Jack and Nusr decided to send it to the short film competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their prize is $500 for the school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Jack and Nasr have both been keen filmmakers since they were in Year 9. Their first film was a horror film, but recently they've turned their attention to making more serious films. This is the second film competition they've entered.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I believe film is a powerful medium to get a serious message across," Jack said.</p>
