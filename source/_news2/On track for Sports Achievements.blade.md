<p>SCHOOL SPORTS: <strong>Whanganui</strong> <strong>High</strong> <strong>School</strong> was able to bring its whole 1500 student body together for the first time this year at Cooks Gardens for their annual sports day yesterday.<br /><em>PHOTO / Bevan Conley</em></p>
<p>Splitting into four house groups - Awa, Maunga, Moana, and Whenua - the students took part in traditional track and field events as well as fun activities like an obstacle course, tug o war, gumboot throws, cone jumps and ball shooting.</p>
<p>There was also the fun run and walk (pictured) and house relays at the end of the day.</p>
