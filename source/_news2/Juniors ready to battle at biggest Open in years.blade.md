<p>LOCAL HOPE: WHS student Sam Russell will fly the flag for the Wanganui Tennis Club at the Slazenger Wanganui Junior Open, which starts tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wanganui Tennis Club development officer Gene Ridgway says the start of tomorrow's Slazenger Wanganui Junior Open will be the largest held at the Basset St courts in several years.</p>
<p>More than 133 players have signed up for the event, with some coming from as far away as Ashburton in Canterbury to take part.</p>
<p>The 14 &amp; Under singles grades have the largest level of entries with 27 boys and 26 girls lining up for a chance to be the 2015 champion.</p>
<p>"Kurt Amey from Feilding Tennis club, a member of the Tennis Central junior team, with a senior national singles ranking of 366 is the top seed," said Ridgway.</p>
<p>Taranaki's Caleb Fleming, nationally ranked 434, is second seed.</p>
<p>Wanganui's Jaiden Edmonds and Bartje Fergusson will fly the flag for the locals in this tough competition.</p>
<p>Last summer's secondary school champion Sam Russell will be the big hope in the 16 &amp; Under boys grade, alongside Jack O'Leary, Sean Gudsell, Terrance Wright and Hunter Stoneman-Boyle in a draw of 23 players.</p>
<p>For the girls, Wanganui's Stella Ridgway is in the 10 &amp; Under, Laura Edmonds the 16 &amp; Under, and the 12 &amp; Under hopefuls are Kiana Akhuata, Skye Caseley, Anna Bullock, and Brooke Pearce.</p>
<p>"Talented youngster from the South Island, Tessa McCann, is the second seed in the girls 14s singles and the third seed in the girls 16s singles and will be one to watch this weekend," said Ridgway.</p>
<p>This tournament is part of the Tennis Central Tri Series, with the points accumulated by the top finishers going towards being selected for the Tennis Central team to play at the nationals.</p>
<p>Prizes come from Slazenger with support from Hire It Wanganui, the Rutland Arms, Top Seed Tennis, id. applications, Pak 'n Save Wanganui, and NZCT for administration.</p>
