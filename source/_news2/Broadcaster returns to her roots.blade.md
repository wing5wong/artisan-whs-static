<p class="element element-paragraph">Nicky Rennie has returned to Whanganui after moving away 30 years ago and will soon celebrate being a broadcaster for just as many years.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Since moving back, the woman who went to Whanganui High School has added another job to her resume - she is currently co-managing the Wanganui Boys &amp; Girls Gym Club.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">There, Ms Rennie is working with her father, Clive, who was asked to help at Rutherford Junior High School after principal Diane Henare's husband passed away late last year.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not only does co-managing the club help Clive, but it also ties into her reason for coming back to the city in the first place.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I made the decision to come back because I wanted to spend some time in the North Island with mum and dad," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm also really looking forward to growing my business and being able to make a difference around Whanganui."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ms Rennie owns a company called Polished Marketing which she now operates in Whanganui, as well as broadcasting on Hokonui from the old NZME studio.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This year I'm celebrating 30 years in broadcasting at the very same radio station I started at, in the same building, from when I was 17 years old," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't make the decision to move here until NZME set the studio up for me to do that, they just made it so easy."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Despite the hefty workload, Ms Rennie was enjoying the challenge of co-managing at the club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Yeah I have quite a work load, but hard work never killed anyone. There are 400 families involved in the gym in this region, so it's an important organisation," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We're looking to improve the services that we offer, things like catering and accommodation - we're going to crank that up to make more money for the gym itself."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Now that she is back, Ms Rennie has no intention of leaving again.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm loving it here, it's a real creative hub, there are world-beaters and people that have achieved great things," she said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"They're doing it all from Whanganui."</p>
