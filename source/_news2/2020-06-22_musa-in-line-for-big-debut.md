Whanganui's former All Whites defender **James Musa** is likely to finally get his debut for Minnesota United in Major League Soccer next month.

After the delays to the season due to the Covid-19 pandemic, all 26 MLS clubs will compete in the 'MLS is Back Tournament' at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, beginning July 8.

Minnesota have been drawn in Group D against Real Salt Lake, Sporting Kansas City and Colorado Rapids.

Group stage matches will count in the MLS regular season standings and the tournament winner will earn a spot in the 2021 Scotiabank Concacaf Champions League.
