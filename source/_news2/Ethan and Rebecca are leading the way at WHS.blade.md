<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>2018 was a big year for Rebecca Baker.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui High School student dominated her competition running 1500m and 3000m races and placed fourth at the Australian Cross Country Championships.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baker, 16, was also selected for the NZ under-18 women's hockey development camp, but it was an off-turf selection that really capped off the year as a success.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baker was named head girl at the Purnell St school's end-of-year prizegiving in which Ethan Cohen was also named head boy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"There were a lot of people who were worthy of the position and I was quite shocked when I heard my name called out," Baker said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Being a Year 9 and going through the years, I always looked up to the head students. Now I am one and I want to be a role model for the younger students."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Baker was born in Gisborne, but moved to Whanganui when she was about 6 and began attending Kaitoke School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Since moving on to WHS, it has become a Baker family affair with sister Charlotte attending and mum Elaine becoming an assistant coach for developing athletes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Athletics was a strong component in pushing Baker to take on the challenge of being a school leader.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was part of the school's athletics team, we have quite a big emphasis on leadership and qualities around life skills," Baker said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I felt really obliged to become a school leader because of that and those skills transitioned in becoming the head girl of high school."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In 2019, Baker has hit the ground running, winning the women's section of the Manawatu/Whanganui Centre Championships and growing accustomed to her new role.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Complementing her is head boy Ethan Cohen</strong>, who has regularly featured in the&nbsp;<em>Chronicle</em>&nbsp;for hockey as far back as 2012 when he was at Whanganui Intermediate School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cohen, 17, was inspired to become a school leader by his brother Jordan, who was head of sport at Whanganui High School in 2018.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I watched what he was doing and it was quite amazing to take count of all the events that happen at school," Cohen said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I didn't realise how much work students put in to trying to make the school great until I became head boy. The kids run a lot of events and really put their hearts into it."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the first four weeks of term one Cohen has been a part of organising the school's annual Valentine's Day event, house swimming sports and Thursday's athletics.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He looks forward to much future planning around movie nights, the house quiz day and charitable events such as World Vision New Zealand's 40-Hour Famine.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cohen said he is honoured to be the head boy of Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I started off in Year 9 not being the most academic or fully involved student. Through the years I've come into my own thanks to high school.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'd like to show the students that any kid can strive to be what they want to be and if they have a goal, they can reach it."</p>
