<p><span>WHS student Riki Wainhouse in action at Landguard Rd on Sunday 18 June.</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was a perfect Sunday for racing and it brought everybody out for the June edition of the Harvey Round Motors Isuzu Winter Championships on Landguard Rd.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In fine conditions, the competition was keen for the third round of the Wanganui Motorcycle Club's winter motocross series, where there was less chance for error as only the first two rounds for each class would count for season points, except B Grade where only one race counted.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Racing at the eries covers age groups ranging from 5-year-old minis up to 45+ veteran.<br />Next round of the series is on July 16.</p>
