Fifteen-year-old Toni Adams doesn’t have to act the part of the lovely young lady who charms the prince because she IS a charming young lady. Toni is a year 10 student at Whanganui High School where her favourite subjects are Drama and English. Ballet dancing and reading are Toni’s other favourite pursuits.

Life is busy for her. She’s been involved with Amdram’s Starlets for four years now and recently played the part of Louisa in The Sound of Music. As well as rehearsing the title role of Cinderella in Rep’s latest production she’s also currently rehearsing the role of Jessica in The Merchant of Venice, which is also in rehearsal.

“It’s good fun and a lot of my friends are in the plays too,” Toni answered when I asked how she managed to juggle rehearsals for two productions at once.

She’s particularly enjoying playing Cinderella as there are a lot of gags and everyone’s so supportive. The fact that Shakespeare’s play won’t open until late February means that those rehearsals aren’t so urgent as yet.

Cinders: the True Story is getting quite busy now with rehearsals becoming more frequent, readying the production for its opening on

Wednesday, December 11 at 6.30pm. It is really funny and all the cast are quite endearing, even the ‘baddies ‘. Do go along to see it as part of your Christmas fun.
