<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui's Lyric Singers donate the proceeds from their end-of-year concert to a local charity each year and this year they chose another singing group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Singing for your Brain support people with brain injuries and neurological conditions with weekly sessions at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Glasgow St.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Lyric Singers Sing for Joy charity concert, held at St Mary's Church on November 27 featured guest appearances by Welsh Mezzo Soprano Elin Tomos and Whanganui poet Airini Beautrais.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We raised $1200 to donate to Singing for your Brain and it is nice for the people who attended the concert to know they have contributed," said Lyric Sanger's' musical director Joanna Love.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Lyn Hughes who helped to found the Singing for Your Brain group in Whanganui said the donation will be a wonderful boost for the group.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Group facilitator Janine and piano player husband Chris Dann travel from Rongotai to lead the group each week and around 50 people regularly attend the two sessions each Monday.</p>
