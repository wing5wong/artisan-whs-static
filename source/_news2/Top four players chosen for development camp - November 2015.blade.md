<p><span>HAVE A BALL: Wanganui's four players chosen for the Hurricanes development camp are Adam Boult, left, Kody Edwards, Shaiden Daniels and<strong>&nbsp;Griffin Culver.</strong></span></p>
<p>The latest four Wanganui bolters have been chosen for the Hurricanes youth development camp in Wellington next month.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of the four Under-16 teenagers chosen for last year's camp, the 2015 edition will include City College's Shaiden Daniels, <strong>Wanganui High School's Griffin Culver</strong>, and Cullinane's Adam Boult and Kody Edwards.</p>
<p>This year's Wanganui Under-16 team made the final of the Hurricanes B tournament against Wellington Development in Levin, losing narrowly 27-24.</p>
<p>All four players had standout performances, as their team received the Outstanding Team Culture and Fairplay award out of all 12 squads in the A and B competitions. Winger Daniels scored six tries in three games, while halfback <strong>Culver</strong> was named in the tournament team.</p>
<p>First-five Edwards was also a try-scorer in the final, and centre Boult set up several scores.</p>
<p>All four teenagers said they were looking forward to training alongside their contemporaries across the Hurricanes catchment, seeing what the standard of performance is among players their own age from the bigger ITM Cup unions like Wellington and Manawatu.</p>
<p>WRFU development officer Lesley McKenzie said two Cullinane College players being chosen reflected well on the school, the boys' training and school coach Hayden Hepburn.</p>
<p>The camp will be on December 13 at Rugby League Park, the Hurricanes' training ground.</p>
