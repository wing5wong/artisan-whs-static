The ‘Central 6 Principals’ represent six large co-ed secondary schools in the Central region. They are Whanganui High School, Freyberg, (Palmerston North), Havelock, Kapiti, Tawa and Taradale.

They have been doing exchanges since 2014, with the initial focus on junior sporting fixtures and then with the principals meeting together. This year each school was also represented by their two heads of school. Tony Kane from Kapiti College told the RCP – “Just like being a principal, it can be lonely being a head of school. So it is a great opportunity to meet others and learn from each other.”

The group arrived on Thursday, March 12 and after a welcome, the students went to their billets before they enjoyed an evening of laser tag. On the Friday morning the heads of school made presentations to each other on the structure of student leadership in their schools and then explained the best event or activity they have led and why it was successful.

They also met the mayor before doing a range of activities involving fixed wheel bikes and e-bikes, at the Velodrome led by Cath Cheatley of the Whanganui Cycling Club.

In the meantime the principals listened to presentations by three High School teachers on:
• Supported learning/pathways
• How the House system works
• Positive behaviour for learning programmes including restorative practices and the role of the student council.

Principal of High School, Martin McAllen, said they also popped into classes asking questions of both teachers and students.

Everyone seemed to think it was a great opportunity for sharing and the students asked if it can happen again.
