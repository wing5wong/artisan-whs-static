<p><strong>Wanganui Under 15 captain Rebecca Baker scored three goals in the win over Manawatu B in Timaru.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both the Wanganui Under 15 teams have made great starts to their national championship tournaments in the South Island by holding their opposition scoreless on Monday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under 15 boys hammered Wellington 6-0 in Invercargill in heavy rain and gale conditions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Andrew Spence said every player delivered to their potential as Wellington were shocked to be trailing 5-0 at halftime.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I expected them to be a strong team, we played them earlier in the season and beat them 3-0.<span style="background-color: #e2e2e2;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"If they could play like that through the whole tournament, they'd be difficult to beat."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Captain Connor Hoskin scored a hat trick from a penalty corner and two field goals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui will now play Canterbury on Tuesday and have their final pool game against West Coast, with the goal to make the Top 8 for the main quarterfinals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Further back up the east coast of the island in Timaru, weather conditions were much better at the Under 15 girls national championship tournament, where the Wanganui girls defeated Manawatu B 4-0.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Wanganui scored two goals in each half, with captain Rebecca Baker getting a hat trick, while Georgia Matson got the fourth goal.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Coach Jan Dixon said it took a little while for the team to get sorted, but once they did everything clicked.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Unlike gale winds, her concern was trying to free the stuck boot in the team van so they could retrieve the team's shoes.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Under 15 girls tournament has 23 teams, with Wanganui in a pool of six.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Their games on Tuesday are against Canterbury and Thames Valley.</p>
