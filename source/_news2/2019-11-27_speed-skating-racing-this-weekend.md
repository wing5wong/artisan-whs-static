This year marks the 10th anniversary running of the Wanganui Roller Sports Club’s Rivercity Speed Skating Tour and the St John’s club has been the principal sponsor and supporter from the beginning.

Skaters from as far away as Dunedin, Blenheim and Nelson will be competing over the weekend of the 23rd and 24th November. The racing starts at Kowhai Park at 9.30am Saturday before moving to Jubilee Stadium at 1.00pm and finishes at Mitre 10 Mega at 6.45pm. Sunday will see the tour continue at Manfield raceway starting at 9.30am followed by a Tri Skate event run by Skate NZ. If rain interrupts proceedings then racing will be at Jubilee Stadium instead.

The St John’s Club President, Royce Tunbridge, presented the sponsorship cheque to a gathering of young Wanganui speed skaters at the Club on Friday evening and said that the St John’s club was pleased to be able to continue to support the event.

The public are welcome to come along and have a look at any of the venues and there is no charge for admission.
