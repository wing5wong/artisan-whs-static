<p class="element element-paragraph">Let me use this space to rave about&nbsp;<em>The Blue Orchid</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It's a nightclub, it's a play, it's an act, it's an evening of good music and entertainment at Amdram Theatre.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>The Blue Orchid</em>&nbsp;was written and directed by Graham Dack and presented on stage by a wealth of Whanganui talent.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">With the theatre set up like a nightclub &mdash; tables with tablecloths and ashtrays with stubbed out cigarettes (some with lipstick on the filters) &mdash; and a real, live band on stage, Amdram becomes The Blue Orchid and we, the audience are the patrons.<br />As well as lots of good music and songs there is a story, ably acted out by a strong, talented cast.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Nigel Irwin plays Lucky, owner of The Blue Orchid, a renowned hot spot on the New York jazz scene. He's good. He can sing and act, and he is a convincing player. Mention must be made of his beautiful diction too, possibly honed in his weekly sermons at Central Baptist Church.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The story is that The Blue Orchid was the starting point for a lot of big name acts, but, 20 years on the club has fallen on hard times and Lucky is looking at bankruptcy and possible forced closure by the banks &mdash; unless he can find a star act to save their fortunes and convince the bankers that all is well with the club.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Cypress Kani-Hurinui is Rusty, Lucky's daughter. Cypress is a Year 13 student at Whanganui High School and is blessed with a voice! Powerful, with a big range and loads of emotion, she's the perfect fit for Rusty, the girl who wants to sing &mdash; against the wishes of her father. The reason for his reluctance to let her sing comes out in the play. Cypress's high school band has just made the finals of the Smoke Free Rock Quest Tangata Beats section (see page 6).</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Playing the part of Sam, Lucky's long-time friend and announcer at the club is Colin Luttrell. He too, has a fine, strong voice and both he and Lucky shine in a duet of&nbsp;<em>Ain't That a Kick in the Head</em>.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Off stage, to the right, on the floor near the tables, is a small, but perfectly formed, bar. It doubles as the bar for The Blue Orchid and is also where Amdram / Blue Orchid patrons, with the aid of a ticket, can purchase a brightly coloured Blue Orchid cocktail &mdash; blue, obviously. At the bar is Joe, played to perfection by Julian Annear. He's got the look, the manner and the New York accent. He also has a realistic-looking cigar.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">On stage, singing solos and providing three-part harmony backings are The Blue Orchid Songbirds &mdash; Shelley Walls (Lilly), Jayne Fields (Rose) and Iutita Kilmister (Poppy) &mdash; although the names suggest a floral arrangement. They can certainly sing, and anyone who has been around Whanganui theatre and the music scene will know that. They also interact well with the audience, giving the odd wink and playing along when &mdash; on one occasion &mdash; a patron imbibed a little heavily and tried to ad-lib an extra, unscripted part, complete with unsteady "dance" moves.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And then there's the band. On piano is <strong>Abigail Livesay</strong>, on double bass and electric guitar is Dave Griffiths, on clarinet is Michael Smyth and backing it all on drums is <strong>Michael Peterson</strong>. The Blue Orchid Band is a class act and they did a magnificent job. From the solo bass of&nbsp;<em>Fever</em>&nbsp;(sung by Iutita) to full swing backing of the big numbers, as well as touches of other solo instruments for mood and feel, they were extraordinary. Tight, polished and very able, the musicians shone.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Making an appearance as the bankers were Ian Jones and Kieran Spence &mdash; not very demanding roles, but well done, anyway &mdash; and patrolling the floor on this particular night was hostess Katie Gray. In another era she would have been called a "cigarette girl". She and Millie Manning share the role. They provide a lovely touch of costumed authenticity.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">We saw The Blue Orchid on Saturday night and it was a full house! Everyone seemed to enjoy the show and the temptation to sing along was irresistible. We heard some great voices and enjoyed a wonderful night of music and story. Congratulations have to go to the hard workers behind the scenes, from lighting, sound, costumes, set design and build to everything that transformed Amdram into The Blue Orchid.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><em>The Blue Orchid</em>&nbsp;is on at 7.30 this week from Wednesday to Saturday at Amdram Theatre in Guyton St. This reviewer recommends it! For more on&nbsp;<em>The Blue Orchid</em>, read Street View on page 37.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">A reminder that this Sunday there will be lots of cars on our roads competing in the Daffodil Rally for Cancer.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Not just vintage and veteran vehicles, although it is being run by the Vintage Car Club (VCC), but cars of all ages and descriptions will be numbered up and rallying around Whanganui streets and rural roads.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They will be meeting at VCC Clubrooms in Patapu St, Whanganui East, before heading off in all directions from 1.15pm. They will finish at Cullinane School hall about 2.45, where competitors will enjoy afternoon tea.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They are raising funds for Whanganui Cancer Society as well as providing a motoring spectacle for people of Whanganui.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Congratulations to Peter Hardy and all at the VCC. Enjoy the rally!</p>
