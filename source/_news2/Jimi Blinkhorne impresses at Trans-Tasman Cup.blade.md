<p class="element element-paragraph">HIS TEAMS may not have won a game but <strong>Whanganui skater</strong> <strong>Jimi Blinkhorne has returned from Australia with two trophies in hand.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Blinkhorne played for both the New Zealand under-17 and senior men's roller hockey teams in a three-test series against their trans-Tasman rivals last week.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Both side lost their respective Trans-Tasman Cup series 3-0 but...</p>
<h3 class="element element-paragraph">Blinkhorne was named the Most Valuable Player of the under-17 series and followed that up with the Supreme Sportsmanship Award across the tournaments four grades.</h3>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">The MVP award - chosen by the referees - was a great way for the 17-year-old to cap of his third and final trans-Tasman series with the age group side, which he also captained.&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, the supreme award was for conduct on and off the field.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">As he makes the shift to senior hockey, Blinkhorne also got a start for each of the New Zealand men's matches.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Blinkhorne is the youngest in the senior team and part of its five year plan to build a strong squad for the future.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"It's a lot more fast-paced and strong," he said, of his first tournament with the senior team.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We've got a real young team though, we're rebuilding."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The biennial Trans-Tasman Cup was held in Gympie in Queensland with New Zealand set to host in 2020.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui was also represented by under-17 coach and men's player Carlin Barry and skater <strong>Brodie Hurndell</strong>&nbsp;(WHS student) who didn't play because of a fractured wrist.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Blinkhorne's next trip is to Korea later this year for the Oceania and Asia qualifiers for the 2019 World Champs in Barcelona.</p>
