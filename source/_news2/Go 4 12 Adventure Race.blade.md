<p><strong>Go 4 12 Adventure Race 2018&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>On 14&nbsp;April Whanganui High School entered 2 teams into the NZ Adventure Racing Championships held in the Hawkes Bay.</p>
<p><strong>The challenge of this event was in the title &ndash;</strong></p>
<h3>Go 4 12 HOURS!</h3>
<p><strong>From 6 am to 6 pm a team of 4 boys and a team of 4 girls competed in cross country running, orienteering, rafting, mountain biking and a large variety of team based and communication activities.</strong></p>
<p>The event started with a 5 km run, then students needed to build and light a fire, and boil water before moving on to a 19 km rafting section, where the students had to make a raft out of car inner tubes, bamboo poles and pieces of ropes. They then had a 8 km orienteering course that brought them to the mountain biking stage where they had to get as many controls as possible. The team then had the option of completing team based problem solving activities or completing another orienteering course on foot. With 2 hours to go the team then chose to depart for the final challenge which was a 35 km mountain bike. Both teams finished in a time of 11 hours and 45 minutes which was a great effort, after a long day.</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations on a massive effort &ndash; hard course and poor weather was all dealt with a smile!</strong></p>
<p>It was a good way to get 8 teenagers asleep by 9 pm on Saturday night!</p>
