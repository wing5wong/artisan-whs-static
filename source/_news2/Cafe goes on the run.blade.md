<p data-bind="text: $data">Mini Cafe in Drews Ave closed its doors on Saturday, and while some may see it as something ending, the Mini Cafe team see a bright new future.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Pip Sperling, Mini Cafe owner and kitchen whiz behind catering firm Mini Gourmet, says they will soon be launching a new venture, a gourmet food delivery van service called Mini on the Run.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">It has meant some serious building work at the Sperling family home and installation of a new commercial kitchen, but the feeling is all positive.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Joining Pip in the delivery venture are Mini Cafe staff Cole Hancox and Kaylah Cameron.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;The team&rsquo;s coming with me,&rdquo; says Pip, &ldquo;Because they&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;ll be doing the vans.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Pip expects the vans to be on the road by 8.30am and they will each cover designated areas and businesses of Whanganui, covering as much of the city as possible. Musical airhorns will announce their arrival.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">Pip has already sent out menus by email to local firms and intends to deliver flyers promoting the business.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a lot of feedback and people are really interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">She says they&rsquo;ll be doing the same food as they did in the cafe, with everything fresh and home made.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still going to be doing all the clubs and stuff, crepes, vegetarian stacks, lasagnes &mdash; everything you&rsquo;d get from a bakery but better. And we&rsquo;re going to do hot meals on a Friday.</p>
<p data-bind="text: $data">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going to stock up the vans and trial it for a couple of weeks to see what people are wanting. Then we&rsquo;ll go from there.&rdquo;</p>
