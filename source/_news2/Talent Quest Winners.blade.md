<p><strong>Write-up of the night by Sophie Couper &amp; Finn Brown (Heads of Culture):-</strong></p>
<p>This year, Wanganui High School hosted a talent Quest competition, unparalleled in its execution. On Wednesday 26th August, 12 acts from all year levels took to the stage to perform in front of friends, family and most nerve racking of all- our judging panel. Ranging from Singing, to beatboxing, to magic and dancing, this talent quest had it all. Our carefully selected Judges consisted of the wonderful and charming, Mrs Campbell (Head of Dance), Mrs Jones (Head of Music), and Mr Hedivan (Head of performing arts).<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The evening was hosted by Eli Tanoi and Liya Pearson, who were more than capable of showing off their own, comedic, entertainment skills and uni-cycling abilities.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Some teams even produced &lsquo;sob stories&rsquo; which were displayed prior to their performance, adding another element to the outstanding evening, and allowing the audience to prepare themselves for what they were about to see.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However with all these tremendous acts, there can only be one winner and this year it went to <strong>Seth Scrimshaw</strong>.</p>
<p>Seth had us mesmerized with his ability to manipulate our decision making, and he definitely blew our minds, it was truly &lsquo;magical&rsquo;.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Second Place was awarded to the group by the name of Sea-Syd- A 3 man group consisting of Connor Bourne, Mitchell Brett-Atkins and Finn Brown. The trio owned the stage and crowd with their entertaining, comedic interpretation of the famous nerd rap, &ldquo;Alphabet Aerobics&rdquo;- showing off the true art of entertainment.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Third Place sent shivers down our spines with blissful tone and harmonies, Eleishah Hodson and Te Paerata Tichbon made us realise how two powerful voices can have us on the edge of our seats and leaving us wanting more.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Other winners on the night included:</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Best dressed- Ben Clow and Sophie Couper<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Most original talent- Ben Walkey on his snare drum<br /></span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Best sob story- Jessica Steel-Johnson</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>On the 5th of September, the top three placings were selected to compete in a <strong>Wanganui Secondary Schools combined competition</strong>, which was organised by the School Leaders Network. The stakes were upped and <strong>Eleishah and Te Paerata rose to the challenge, claiming first place and the grand $500 prize</strong>. The Sea Syd crew also gained third place with Ben Clow filling Finn Brown&rsquo;s role in the performance.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Wanganui High School Talent Quest was a completely student run event, from the lighting and stage managing, to coordinating the overall show, the cultural prefects did tremendously well, filling over 300 seats. We hope that this event becomes an annual occurrence along with the Wanganui wide competition, as both events showcased some remarkable talent that doesn&rsquo;t get another real chance to be admired.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
