<p>WANGANUI High School has invested heavily in its sporting future with the official opening of a brand new all-weather turf facility yesterday.</p>
<p>Four years in the making, the new complex features six tennis courts, five netball courts, a hockey training ground and six basketball hoops around the high perimeter fence.</p>
<p>Associate principal Elizabeth Spooner said resurfacing the old courts at the school was mooted by a member of the physical education (PE) department about four years ago.</p>
<p>"Initially I thought the job was impossible because of the cost, but then I realised there was a need for us to be more active in sport, I felt we were lagging behind," Spooner said at the opening yesterday.</p>
<p>With support from the Board of Trustees, and in particular Murray Woodhouse, the project was further investigated and eventually launched.</p>
<p>Woodhouse said there were only a couple of options given the Ministry of Education did not fund this type of activity.</p>
<p>"It came down to the board to either fundraise or use reserve board funds, which is what was decided on eventually. At $300,000 it was an expensive exercise, but needed," he said.</p>
<p>The design was awarded to Wanganui architects BSM.</p>
<p>"After a great deal of hard work, thanks to architect Gerald Cogan of BSM, the school is very proud to have this magnificent all-weather facility. It provides a superb arena for the school to expand its PE curriculum and to encourage greater participation by all students," Spooner said.</p>
<p>"For a large school, the facility allows a number of events to be provided on-site, which is also an added advantage, and will continue to be a great asset for both the school and wider community for many years to come."</p>
