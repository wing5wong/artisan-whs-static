<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">Ag Challenge has around 170 full time students a year and thanks to the training they get plus the connections Ag Challenge has with industry, over 90% of graduates from their courses get jobs. Frequently Ag Challenge will be contacted by employers during the year asking if they could recommend someone.</span></span></p>
<p class="BasicParagraph"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span lang="EN-GB">It would pay to come to the Whanganui Careers Expo this Friday, May 20 from 4pm to 7pm to see what Ag Challenge can offer in the fields of agriculture, animal technology and construction.

In the process they are picking up valuable NCEA credits, up to 44 at level 2 or up to 53 credits at level 3. As Manager Peter Macdonald says &ldquo;you can try before you buy.&rdquo; They even offer the chance to catch up on opportunities during the school holidays. The learning takes place out of town in Okoia and transport is provided. </span></span></p>
