<p><br />The Lyric Singers' mid-year concert Taking Flight will feature talented local musicians and singers as guest artists.</p>

Joan Sullivan will conduct Benedictus and The Prayer in the same bracket of songs.</p>
<p>The first guest artists will be members of Brass Whanganui concert band and junior band.</p>
<p>The second guest bracket will showcase student vocalists Sophie Toyne and WHS student&nbsp;<strong>Leigh-ana Hale</strong>, both students of singing teacher <strong>Marie Brooks</strong> (WHS Music Tutor).</p>
<p>The final guest bracket will feature student flautist, Chantelle Piper, performing flute duets with her teacher, Lisa Boessenkool, as well as a solo item.</p>
<p>The choir is conducted by <strong>Joanna Love </strong>(WHS teacher)&nbsp;and accompanied by Lisa Boessenkool.</p>
