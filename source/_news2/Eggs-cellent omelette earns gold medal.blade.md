<p class="element element-paragraph">In&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, Aragorn is a sword wielding warrior who slices orcs into pieces. But in Whanganui, Aragorn Cavanagh is a budding chef who chops up ingredients with his knife.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">And he is very good at it.</p>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">Cavanagh, 16, was the overall winner of the UCOL Secondary Schools Hospitality Competition that took place at the Whanganui Campus on Rutland Street last Friday.</h4>
<h4 class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui High School student won a silver medal for his white bread loaf, gold in the omelette category and a gold with distinction - which is a perfect score - for his black forest cupcakes.</h4>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was surprised and very excited to win," Cavanagh said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I did a competition once for the regionals in New Plymouth, but it didn't turn out well, so I'm proud of how I turned things around from then."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Cavanagh gets his cooking inspiration from his mum and brother, who he observed in action from a young age.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"My favourite thing to cook in the competition was the omelette because it was a live kitchen and I did well in that," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I was very nervous, but I just thought to myself 'I need to get through this' and I was telling my teammate Kelahn [Te Awhe] 'you can do this'.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">In the live kitchen, three judges were observing the teams of two from Whanganui Girls' College, Whanganui City College and Whanganui High School.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It is different to a static kitchen, which allows competitors to make the meal without the judge watching their actions and taking it to them for judging on completion.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The winner of each category in the competition won a $50 cash prize courtesy of Woodhaven Gardens in Levin.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I got a few prizes, three or four, I haven't looked into it much yet, but I know I got a bluetooth speaker, a notebook, a pen and some gift bags," Cavanagh said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I love food, I love cooking it and when people enjoy your cooking, it makes you happy."</p>
