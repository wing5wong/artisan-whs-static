<p><strong>BIG TIME: &nbsp;Former WHS student, Seth Haapu's song <em>10 years</em> is up for the 2016 APRA Silver Scroll.</strong></p>
<p>Whanganui born and raised musician Seth Haapu is up for the most prestigious New Zealand songwriting award.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Haapu was named as a finalist for the APRA Silver Scroll award on Thursday for his song, 10 years.</p>
<p>He is up against 19 other finalists, including prominent New Zealand artists Shayne Carter, Tami and Jay Neilson, Lawrence Arabia and Dave Dobbyn.</p>
<p>10 years was released this year and is included on his three-track EP Volume 1.</p>
<p>Haapu went to Castlecliff School and Rutherford Intermediate. At Wanganui High School he studied music and in the 2001 Rockquest he played with two boys who later became members of The Have. In 2009 he signed with Sony Music releasing a full-length self-titled album in 2011.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The following year he was a finalist for best male solo artist at the Vodafone New Zealand Music Awards.</p>
<p>Haapu learned classical piano from 10, and started teaching himself the guitar at 11. After leaving school he moved to Sydney for three years, and got a job. Friends found him minor gigs and he honed his craft.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The APRA Silver Scroll Award recognises outstanding achievement in the craft of songwriting.</p>
<p>The winner is decided by vote of APRA's more than 10,000 membership of New Zealand songwriters and composers.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Top 20 member voting is now open, and closes on Sunday, August 14, with the award presented at Auckland's Vector Arena on September 29.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p>
