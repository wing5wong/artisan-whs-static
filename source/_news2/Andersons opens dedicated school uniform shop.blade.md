<p><strong>Andersons opens dedicated school uniform shop</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Andersons Menswear has been supplying school uniforms for a long time but now they have opened a second store in the old Eades Sports shop at 184 Victoria Ave to supply not only school uniforms but shoes, socks and bags. They stock the full requirements for ten local schools including all the secondary schools.</strong></p>
<p>The shop is able to boast eight fitting rooms, nine staff for the next few weeks and a variety of payment options. Anothe<span class="text_exposed_show">r part of their service is an alteration service covering everything from blazers to shirts to trousers.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Manager of the shop, Robyn Voullaire, says &ldquo;we have all the rules and regulations for each of our schools and can advise parents on what is required and permitted.&rdquo; She adds &ldquo;we have six different styles of school shoes. They are all in the higher quality range but still very affordable. They include New Zealand produced shoes and will stand up to tough usage from young people.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">An important part of the business is selling second-hand clothing which they buy from customers. Robyn says &ldquo;the turnover is regular and it is growing.&rdquo;<br />The location is a good one. The shop is large and airy with plenty of car parking close by. It is open from 8.30am to 5pm during the week and from 9am to 1pm on Saturdays, making shopping easier for working parents and families.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">The Manager of Andersons, Darrell Smith, says that schools are moving towards specialists like them to manage their uniform sales, as it is becoming increasingly difficult for schools to arrange staff/PTA volunteers to run their own shops. School shops have found the profits inadequate and the costs of keeping stock no longer worth it. Once they have been assured that Andersons is able to provide the best deals, offer ample supplies consistently and being open year round, they have been won over. Darrell says &ldquo;we welcome other school principals and staff to visit the shop and to discuss what we can do for them.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">Andersons has the advantage of being part of a New Zealand buying group, able to negotiate deals in currently four different countries. Robyn points out that the High School sports uniform was designed by the school and arranged by Andersons to be manufactured in China using the latest in garment printing.<br /></span></p>
<p><span class="text_exposed_show">They try to source as much as possible within New Zealand. The high quality jerseys are from the Manawatu and the socks are knitted in New Zealand.</span></p>
