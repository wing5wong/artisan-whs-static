<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Whanganui racer James Rountree is aiming for podium finishes in two classes in one of his final flings in the junior ranks.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountree turns 17 in June and has targeted the New Zealand Motocross Championships on the Flips MX Park near Foxton this weekend as one of his major chances to add to his podium tally before moving up the grades.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Rountree will race in the 15-16 years 125cc class on his Yamaha YZ125 and the 14-16 years 250cc class on his Yamaha YZF250 and his good recent form he is hoping for a top three placing in each class at his last junior nationals.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Year 13 Whanganui High School student will have a total of 14 races over busy three days this weekend.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">But it does not stop there.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The following weekend Rountree will be flying to Adelaide, Australia to race at Murray Bridge in the Australian MXD class on a YZF250. This class is for under 19-year-old riders and he will be one of the youngest in the class.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"This class is a lot faster than what I have currently being riding," Rountree said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"I'm just mostly going over for the experience and see how I go. I raced a few of the guys at the Aussie junior nationals last October and if I finished in the top 20 I would be happy.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Josh Coppins from Yamaha NZ has helped me with getting a bike etc and that's helped a lot, but first thing is this weekend, that's what I'm focusing on at present. My fitness is good and I'm ready to go."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">While the meeting this weekend is Rountree's final fling at junior national level, there are junior ranked races he may contest down south around Queen's Birthday a week before he turns 17.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Meanwhile, other Whanganui riders racing this weekend at the NZ juniors are Jet Ashworth, Jamie Bennett, Troy Bullock, Alex Luff Scott, Chase Williamson, Finn Lennox and Ajah Sullivan.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Racing starts on Friday and finishes on Sunday.</p>
