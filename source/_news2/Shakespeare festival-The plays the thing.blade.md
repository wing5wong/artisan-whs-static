<p>Four schools, 120 students and 22 different acts took the stage yesterday (Sunday 2 April) at Whanganui Girls' College for the regional Shakespeare festival.</p>
<p>The University of Otago Sheilah Winn Shakespeare Festival has been an annual event since 2007 involving more than half of the secondary schools in the country. The regional festivals determine which acts will compete at nationals on Queen's Birthday weekend in June.</p>
<p>Whanganui Girls' College drama teacher Paul Collins said 17 schools were invited but only four turned up.</p>
<p>Feilding High School, Freyberg High School, Whanganui High School and Whanganui Girls' College attended the festival with a range of different acts.</p>
<p>Mr Collins said all but four out of the 22 acts were directed by the students themselves and in previous years the standard has been very high.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen the other schools performances but from Whanganui Girls' College we have some great pieces. One of ours is based on the TV series&nbsp;<em>Orange is the New Black</em>&nbsp;performing&nbsp;<em>Richard III</em>...Clarence dies in a prison cell.</p>
<p>"Another one is a Japanese take on&nbsp;<em>Twelfth Night</em>&nbsp;and they are all dressed in kimonos," Mr Collins said.</p>
<p>Students engaged with Shakespeare's plays by performing five-minute and 15-minute excerpts.</p>
<p>Comedian and musician Hayley Sproull judged the event, selecting best five-minute act, best 15-minute piece and best overall actor.</p>
