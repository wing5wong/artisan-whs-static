<p><span><br />The Whanganui Arts Society based at Cooks Gallery on Trafalgar Street (next to the velodrome) is exhibiting the works of 14 of its members, especially for Artists Open Studios. Together they have over 60 art works covering nearly all painting types from water colour, pastel, prints and embroidery through to pottery. Nearly all the works are for sale at very reasonable prices.</span></p>
