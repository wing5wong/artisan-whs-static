<p><br />This year, we took a team of 9 up to Rotorua on Sunday 23&nbsp;June to complete in Hillary Challenge Adventure Racing event. We knew the weekend would be very challenging both physically and mentally, with many activities to keep us thinking and on our toes. However, we could not be sure of what exactly would be thrown our way, which proved to only make things more exciting.</p>
<p>The event started in clod wet conditions involving a Mountain Biking Rogaine through the Redwoods. We had 3 hours to collect as may points as we could. We then dropped our bikes at Blue lake and spent 3 hours running through the forest on foot collecting as may controls as we could &ndash; there was also 4 mystery activity&rsquo;s worth bonus points that we could complete, including a water transfer and stand up paddle boards (SUP). Fortunately, the sun came out by then!</p>
<p>Overall, the event proved to be great fun and a new experience which none of us will forget. We were extremely proud with our result of being placed 11<sup>th</sup> out of 30 teams.</p>
