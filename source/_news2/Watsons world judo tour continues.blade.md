<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Whanganui's judoka Keightley Watson successfully defended his Australian Capital Territory International Open title in Canberra last weekend.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Competing in the Junior men's over 100kg division, it was another gold for Watson, who used last year's victory to springboard into the New Zealand team at the Oceania Championships.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph"><strong>Competing in three different divisions for the first time at this competition, the 16-year-old Watson also took gold in the Cadets over 90kg and bronze in the Senior men's over 100kg.</strong></p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Father Ross Watson said temperatures in Canberra were in the mid-30's, so it was a long day of competition with little rest time between the different divisions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">His son now has a quick turnaround as he flies out next week to return to the Netherlands to resume training with Grim Vuijsters, a multiple time Dutch champion and European championship silver medallist.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">That four weeks training will be the build up to competing in the International Masters Judo Open in Bremen, Germany, at the end of March.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Watson will enter Cadet Over 90kg and Junior Men's Over 100kg competition.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Ross Watson said many competitors use this event as a selection tournament to compete in the European Cup tournaments.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Keightley will come back to New Zealand for two days before heading to New Caledonia for the Oceania Judo Union Championships, again competing in the Cadet and Junior men divisions.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui judo referee Diane Limbrey was also in Canberra officiating the event, as well as being one of five New Zealand referees who attended the following International Judo Federation referee and coaching seminar.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Representatives from China, Hong Kong and Nepal were there, as well as presenters from Uzbekistan and Algeria.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Limbrey said she will be taking what she learned at the Canberra seminar to give presentations to clubs in Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">After that, she will represent New Zealand as a referee in Pan American Judo Opens in Lima and Buenos Aires in March, and is hopeful of also going to New Caledonia for the Oceania championships in April.</p>
