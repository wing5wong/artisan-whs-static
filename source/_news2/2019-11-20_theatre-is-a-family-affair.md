Anyone involved in Wanganui theatre will be familiar with Kieran Spence, the fourth generation of a notable theatre family.

Kieran’s mother, Debbie, is well known as a dancer and a delightful actress, particularly of comedy roles, and older Wanganui theatre goers will remember Debbie’s mother, Shirley London, as a gifted singer and actress.

“Grandad Bob London was also in theatre, acting and playing the piano while back another generation, Shirley’s father Grandad Sid, was an actor and pianist. He was the president of Amdram, in the 1950s I think,” Kieran says.

What was Kieran’s first show?

“I was the baby in Barnum in 1986. After that I was the weasel in the chicken barn when Rainbow Theatre put on Fantastic Mr Fox. **At High School I was in a lot of shows but West Side Story was a highlight.** When Amdram put on Murder on the Orient Express, I had a part in that too.”

In 2012 Kieran spent a year living in Palmerston North where he studied for a Diploma in Performing Arts. Level Five. He is bringing those skills to Repertory Theatre playing the part of the Hairy Godmother in our December production, Cinders: the True Story.

Is he enjoying the rehearsals?

“Oh yes. I talk in rhyme — not once or twice but all the time.”

The Hairy Godmother gets her spells mixed up sometimes so she’s going to need some help. Boys and girls please bring mums and dads along (and grandmothers and grandfathers) and help the Hairy Godmother do her spells properly. She’s onstage at Repertory Theatre in early December. See you there.
