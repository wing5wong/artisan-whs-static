<p class="element element-paragraph"><br />Just two weeks into the 2019 Women's Federation Football League and Team Ritesh Football Whanganui have already beaten their 2018 record.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The Whanganui side dominated Feilding United 6-1 at Wembley Park on Sunday to pick up their first win of the season and their third since joining the league in 2017.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">It was the first time the women in blue have scored six in a game, with Rose Davidson and Dana McClelland scoring two each and <strong>Amy Haughian</strong> and Candice Armstrong also hitting the back of the net.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui coach Matthew Calvert said his team started superbly.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"We went straight into their half, got on the front foot and hit them with a sucker punch, scoring two really good goals in the first five minutes," he said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Then we sort of dropped off a little bit, Feilding scored a goal which I was really disappointed about."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Whanganui led 2-1 at halftime, during which Calvert told his team to get the ball to the strikers more.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">They did just that and came out firing again in the second half, scoring another two goals in the first 15 minutes and then finishing the job with two more.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Their back four couldn't get anywhere near our attacking players. We absolutely had them and if it wasn't for their goalkeeper, we would have scored a lot more," Calvert said.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"In all honesty, I'm a bit disappointed that we didn't get to double figures. That's how good our attacking forward play from the back was."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Calvert joined the team as coach during the pre-season last year and during their two years in the league, they had managed only one win and one draw each season</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Calvert said the biggest difference in 2019 is that there is competition for positions within the squad.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"At the moment we're building squads of 16 and keeping players out of the team. We brought in new players who have automatically brought in quality and the right attitude.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"The existing players from the last couple of years have seen that and picked up their games. They've looked after themselves a lot better coming into this season."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">The sidelines were lined with spectators as more than 80 supporters turned out to watch the locals play at Wembley Park.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Calvert hopes to see more of the same when his side take on third placed Massey University FC there on May 5 kicking off at 1pm.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">He said he wants to turn Wembley Park into a home fortress.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"What was great yesterday was that there were 80 plus people who had come to watch women's football on a Sunday.</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">"Wembley was packed with cars, there were loads of people watching and it gave a big signal as to what we can actually do with women's football."</p>
<p class="element element-paragraph">Before that, the Whanganui team are set to challenge fifth placed Taradale AFC in Napier on April 28 at 1pm.</p>
