Following Macbeth in 2016 and The Tempest in 2018, the Bason Botanic Gardens brings to Whanganui The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare’s blackest comedy.

Bassanio needs money to woo Portia. He asks to borrow some from his friend Antonio, who is a little skint and therefore needs to borrow money from Shylock, a Jewish money-lender. In lieu of charging interest, Shylock offers to instead take a pound of Antonio’s flesh. What could go wrong?

Portia can only be won by the chap who guesses which of three boxes has her portrait. Only one can win. And there’s more than just one relationship which rests on Bassanio being successful.

Shylock’s daughter Jessica has fallen in love with a Christian man. There is only one way that they can be together and that is if they elope.

Antonio has been unlucky — all of his overseas ships have gone down or disappeared and he now has to pay the bond of the pound of his flesh. Although the Duke of Venice would like to rule against it, it is important to Venice’s economic future to show that deals are honoured. A young lawyer named Balthazar tries the case.

And there’s this new bean called “coffee” which has just started showing up from Arabia. Merchants are experimenting with it, to see if they can create a market for it. But it’s not easy.
