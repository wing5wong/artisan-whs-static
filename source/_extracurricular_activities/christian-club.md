Christian group is held once a week on Mondays. We get together, play some games, chat about our weeks, and will have a topic or study to discuss each week. If you’ve been wanting to make Christian friends, or even if you’re just curious what it’s all about, this is for you.

**Who can join:** Anyone – you do not have to be Christian!

**When:** Mondays at 1st break in the C4 breakout room

**Cost:** None
