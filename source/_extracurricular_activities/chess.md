Chess is an age-old game of strategy, tactics, and logical thinking. If you have never played before, we would be more than happy to teach you the rules and help you learn some strategy. If you already know the game, come along for a challenge or even just fun.

**Who can join**: All students

**When:** Meetings are Fridays after school in the library from 2pm onwards. Chess boards will be set up and ready to play, and students are welcome to come and go as they please.

**Event:** We attend various chess competitions throughout the year, including individual and team tournaments. These are both regional and national.

**Cost:** There is no cost to come along on Fridays. Competitions are often $12.50 per person.
