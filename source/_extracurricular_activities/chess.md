Chess is an age-old game of strategy, tactics, and logical thinking. If you have never played before, we would be more than happy to teach you the rules and help you learn some strategy. If you already know the game, come along for a challenge or even just fun.

**Who can join**: All students

**When:** Thursday at 1st Break in LB1 (Library).

**Event:** We attend various chess competitions throughout the year, including individual and team tournaments. These are both regional and national.

**Cost:** There is no cost to come along on Thursdays. Competitions are often $16 per person.
