Model United Nations is a conference that simulates the real working of a UN assembly. Students take on a diplomatic persona, and defend the policies of the country that they are representing and they also get to discuss and learn about real international issues. The invaluable experience of learning about the factors that influence the outcome of international political deliberations will help students develop skills such as independent research skills, debating and negotiating skills, and expanding their knowledge base on international relations. So if you have an enquiring mind, enjoy intelligent conversation and like to have fun, Model UN is perfect for you.
