Girls' Cricket is a developing sport at Whanganui High School.  
We have a 1st XI squad.  
No experience is necessary to start playing, just a good attitude and a willingness to participate.

**Training** is after school for one hour.  
**Played** on Wednesday (tbc).

All **equipment** is provided and the girls wear PE tops and black shorts/pants.


**1st XI Coach:** Gabrielle McKenzie
