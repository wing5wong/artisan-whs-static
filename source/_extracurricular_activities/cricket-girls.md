Girls' Cricket is a developing sport at Whanganui High School.  
We have a large 1st XI squad.  
No experience is necessary to start playing, just a good attitude and a willingness to participate.

**Training** is after school for one hour. Day and time will be confirmed once team sorted.

**Played** on Wednesday.

All **equipment** is provided and the girls wear PE tops with black shorts/pants.


**1st XI Coach:** Warren Marr
