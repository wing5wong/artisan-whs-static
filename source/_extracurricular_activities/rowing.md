Wanganui is fortunate to have an excellent facility for all year-round rowing. We 
have an arrangement with the Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club with approximately 
25 students who are able to take advantage of the facilities and coaching.


If you are interested in Rowing or becoming Coxswain, the sport of Rowing could be 
your choice of activity whilst at WHS. The Coxswain steers the boat and gives the 
Crew instruction about their performance. 


**Practices** are either Saturday or Sunday mornings and three or four evenings per week in summer. In Winter coaches run indoor fitness classes where possible.  
There will be a ‘Learn to Row’ programme for new Rowers starting in April 2023.


**The season** starts in September/October and ends in March/April after the Maadi Cup Regatta. Rowers participate in a number of regattas over this time.
