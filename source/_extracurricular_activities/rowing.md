Whanganui is fortunate to have an excellent facility for all year-round rowing. We 
have an arrangement with the Aramoho Whanganui Rowing Club with approximately 
60 students who can take advantage of the facilities and coaching.

If you are interested in Rowing or becoming a Coxswain, the sport of Rowing could be 
your choice of activity whilst at WHS. The Coxswain steers the boat and gives the 
Crew instruction about their performance.
 

**Trainings** are either Saturday or Sunday mornings and three or four evenings per week in summer. In Winter, coaches run indoor fitness classes where possible.  
There will be a ‘Learn to Row’ programme for new Rowers starting in September 2025.


**The season** starts in September/October and ends in March/April after the Maadi 
Cup Regatta. Rowers participate in several Regattas over this time.  
WHS won their first Gold Medal in 8 years at the 2024 Aon Maadi Regatta and also finished 4th overall in the country.

**Costs:** There is a membership fee that students pay to the Aramoho club to cover  equipment use. Approx $500 - $750. Regatta fees are a separate cost to this.  
WHS Regatta fees will be invoiced to parents through school.  
Fees could vary each year.

**Teacher in Charge:** Mrs Lisa Murphy  
**Coach:** Mr Axel Dickinson
