There are trials for a Girls, Boys or Mixed team. This team heads away to the NZSS Nationals in December.  
You will need to keep an eye on the school daily notices for when trials will be. 

We also enter teams in Term 1 & 4 to the Whanganui Secondary School League.  
Again, signups for these teams will be in the daily notices.  
Ideally, players make their own teams up with their friends and bring their team list to the Mrs Murphy.  
This competition is usually held on Wednesdays.

**Costs:** Determined by competition entry either in Term 1 or 4 (usually $20 per term)  

**Uniform:** WHS PE top and black shorts.

**Teacher in Charge:** Lisa Murphy (murphy.l@whs.ac.nz)  
**Coach:** Mike Lama
