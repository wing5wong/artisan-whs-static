Kia Whaiora is our school Kapa Haka, originally established in 1999. The name stems from the school whakataukii of “LIFE”, which is an acronym for the following kura values;  

Learning - Ako  
Integrity - Mana  
Fellowship - Whanaungatanga  
Excellence – Kairangi
 
Our current tutors who prepared our rōpū to perform at the Aotea Regional Kapa Haka competition held here in Whanganui this year (2025) are Whaea Turehu Simon-Mokai and Matua Anaru Simon-Mokai.  
The regional competition occurs every 2 years. The next one will take place in the Taranaki region in 2027.
