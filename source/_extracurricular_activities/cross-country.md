**Structure**  
As well as our annual Cross Country Champs, Whanganui High School students compete and train through the school.  We have a year-round programme with emphasis on Cross Country and Conditioning during winter and Athletics in summer.  The Cross Country programme caters for winter sports players.


**Competitions**   
The WHS School Cross Country takes place on Wednesday 10 May at Whanganui High School.
Year 9 and Year 10 students will be preparing for this in PE classes.

From the school event, teams will be selected for the Whanganui Secondary Schoolâ€™s competition, which takes place on Tuesday 16 May - Relay Race & Tuesday 23 May - Individual Race.  

Our most successful runners will then be invited to represent Whanganui High School 
at the National Secondary Schools' Cross Country event held in Palmerston North on 8-10 December.

**Training Days:** Generally, Tuesday and Thursday at school from 3:15pm, with some Saturday morning trainings close to competitions.
