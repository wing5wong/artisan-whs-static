**Structure**  
As well as our annual Cross Country Champs, Whanganui High School students compete and train through the school. We have a year-round programme with emphasis on Cross Country and conditioning during winter and athletics in summer. The Cross Country schedule compliments the training for other winter sport codes within the school. 

**Competitions**   
WHS School Cross Country takes place on 6 May at Whanganui High School.
Year 9 and Year 10 students will be preparing for this in PE classes.

From the school event, teams will be selected for the Whanganui Secondary Schoolâ€™s competition, which takes place on 21 May 2020.

Our most successful runners will then be invited to represent Whanganui High School at the National Secondary Schools' Cross Country event held in Hawera on 20 and 21 June 2020. 

**Cost:** The school and interschool events incur no financial cost, just an investment in regular training.

**Training Days:** Generally, Tuesday and Thursday at school from 3.15pm, with some Saturday morning trainings close to competitions.

**Teacher-in-charge:** Mrs. L Murphy (murphy.l@whs.ac.nz)  
**Coach:** Mr Greg Fromont
