The WHS School Cross Country takes place on Wednesday 13 May at Whanganui High School.
Year 9 and Year 10 students will be preparing for this in PE classes.  

From the school event, individuals will be selected for the Whanganui Secondary School’s competition, which takes place on Thursday 4 June.  

Our most successful runners will then be invited to represent Whanganui High School 
at the National Secondary Schools' Cross Country event in Wellington on 20/21 June.
