**Background**  
Whanganui High school now has a strong Cross Country programme, and last year we had two of our students finish in the top 5 at the NZ Secondary Schools Nationals, and one selected in the NZ Secondary Schools’ team for the Australasian champs where they finished 4th.  

**Structure**  
As well as our annual Cross Country Champs, Whanganui High School students compete and train through the school. We have a year-round programme with emphasis on Cross Country and conditioning during winter and athletics in summer. The Cross Country schedule compliments the training for other winter sport codes within the school. 

**Competitions**   
WHS School Cross Country takes place on 8 May at Springvale Park.
Year 9 and Year 10 students will be preparing for this in PE classes.

From the school event, teams will be selected for the Whanganui Secondary School’s competition, which takes place on 23 May 2019.

Our most successful runners will then be invited to represent Whanganui High School at the National Secondary Schools' Cross Country event held in Timaru on 15 & 16 June 2019. 

**Cost:** The school and interschool events incur no financial cost, just an investment in regular training.

**Training Days:** Generally, Tuesday and Thursday at school from 3.15pm, with some Saturday morning trainings close to competitions.

**Teacher-in-charge:** Mrs. L Murphy (murphy.l@whs.ac.nz)  
**Coach:** Greg Fromont
