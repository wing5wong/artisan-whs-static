Magic: The Gathering Club is a table top card game. The game is challenging, fun and competitive. It is a social game where a high standard of behaviour and sportsmanship is expected. 

**Who can join:** Anyone is welcome to join.

**When:** We meet every lunchtime in E4.

**Event:** We often run fun events and competitions for a small cost. We have taken the more competitive students to bigger international level events, such as a Mythic Championship in Sydney Australia in 2018, and the Representationals (NZ Nationals) in Auckland in 2019.

**Cost:** Small cost.
