**Background**  
Whanganui High School has a very strong athletics programme, and we are now ranked 2nd in New Zealand after our performances at the 2019 Athletics Nationals in Wellington where we won 7 medals. One of our students made the NZ Secondary Schools' team.  Athletics also acts as a conditioning base for other codes within the school and many athletes within the programme have gone on to represent the school at high levels in other codes due to their excellent conditioning.

**Structure**  
As well as our annual athletics sports, Whanganui High School students compete and train through the school. We have a year-round programme with emphasis on Athletics in summer and Cross Country and Conditioning during winter.  This also fits in with winter sports requirements especially for juniors.

**Competitions**  
Club nights are every Tuesday evening Terms 1 & 4, 6.30pm at Cooks Gardens. Club nights will start for the school team on Tuesday 28 January.
