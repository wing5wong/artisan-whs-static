**Background**  
Whanganui High School has a very strong athletics programme, and have shown its great depth especially in sprints in local and regional competitions. A look in the local rankings shows how well our WHS and ex WHS athletes have been going in the sprints.  WHS is ranked as one of the top athletic schools in NZ. At the 2022 Athletics Nationals, Whanganui High School won 8 medals.  
Athletics also acts as a conditioning base for other codes within the school and many athletes within the programme have gone on to represent the school at high levels in other codes due to their excellent conditioning.

**Structure**  
As well as our annual athletics sports, Whanganui High School students compete and train through the school. We have a year-round programme with emphasis on Athletics in summer and Cross Country and Conditioning during winter.  This also fits in with winter sports requirements especially for juniors.
