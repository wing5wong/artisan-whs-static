AwaSide is a choir for students who love to sing and are keen to develop their vocal abilities. We sing a range of styles and have a lot of fun along the way. Highlights for our choir include: three successful trips to Sydney to compete in the Australian International Music Festival where the choir has gained silver medals and the bronze award in the Cadenza Competition, part of the NZ Big Sing.

**Who can join:** All students

**When:** Rehearsals are held every week.

**Event:** 
WHS Awaside attends New Zealand's largest Choral event, NZCF's 'The Big Sing' - Secondary Schools Choral Festival, where they participate at regionals.  
In 2022 from their performance at regionals Awaside were one of the 12 choirs invited to attend Cadenza where they won the Bronze Award.
