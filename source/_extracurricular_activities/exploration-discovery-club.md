The Exploration and Discovery Club provides opportunities for students to explore remote and unique places around the North Island. The point is to enjoy new sites, make new friends, laugh, practice your car karaoke and learn a little along the way. Students need to be travel hardened and be able to withstand long van trips on very windy roads. 

**Who can join:** Year 10 to Year 13

**When:**  Usually one trip per Term. Meetings are only held prior to our trips. Membership is open to Year 10 to 13. Trip information will be posted in the Daily Notices. Come and speak to Mr Hunter at any time for further details.

**Cost:** Costs range from $100 (one night) up to $300 (3 nights), depending on destination.
