Kia Ora, Hello or Guten Tag!

Hey,
My name is Kyra. I am sixteen years old and live next to Frankfurt. That is a city in Germany. I live with my mum, sister, step dad and my two cats. 

I arrived in Whanganui in October and I will stay until April. Now I am in year 11 but I will be in year 12 for the last three months. In my opinion, the school system in New Zealand is much better than in Germany and it is definitely more fun.
I live in a big host family and I am very happy to live with them, because they are so lovely. My host parents always care about my well-being and my two younger host sisters are like good friends.

I already have been on trips. You can’t imagine how much fun this is. My favourite activity was a slide called “Swoop”. It was like a slide in the air in the adventure park in Rotorua. It was 45 meters high and I was so scared. I screamed so loud but I am happy that I did it because it was so much fun.

I spend most of the time with athletics training in school and competitions. I really enjoy it and it is so much fun. I love my team! I am looking forward to the national secondary school championships in December. I am very honoured to represent the school in such a high-grade competition.

I am enjoying my life in New Zealand and I believe it is the best time in my life. I am very happy that I can stay for longer, because most of my German friends have to leave soon.

Thanks for everything! <3
