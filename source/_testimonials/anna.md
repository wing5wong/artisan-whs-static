CIAO!

I am Anna, I'm 17 years old and I come from Italy. I`ve been here for one month and I still have another one to know better about Kiwis and New Zealand. As far as I am concerned this experience is what I had been hoping to find for months: I`ve always wanted to improve my English and meet people from another country, make new friends and become more self-confident and easy-going.

I couldn't get along better with my family in Italy and with my friends, too: they are very special to me and here I came to realize it even more. That is the first reason why I came here: if you feel like you are having a great time at home, just try something else to colour your life even more.
Trust me: this is the best way to improve your personal skills and to know yourself better. Spending some time far from home can help you a lot. And even one month or a few weeks can help you, so if I had to suggest someone going abroad to make this type of experience, I'd tell them that no matter how long it lasts, as long as you live there -I mean LIVE-  every single day.
In the first days, I literally fell in love with Whanganui. You will say “in Italy you have a lot of beautiful cities: Milan, Florence, Venice, Rome… . Why is Whanganui so special to you?” I will tell you: you have awa, you have the lake and the ocean, you have the mountains and you have a lot of green areas. I`m inclined to believe that this is the reason why I liked this town from the very beginning: just nature, and different culture, of course. I'm interested in other cultures, and especially in one of the cultures of the furthest place from Italy. I think just being on the other side of the world, 19 thousands kilometres from home is awesome. You should give it a try!
It took me a month to get used to school here, though. High school in Italy is very different and way harder; I got bored easily in the first days, but it was just a question of time. I learnt that there is no point in comparing things and tell which one is better: it is just different and I came to appreciate it. I`m trying to make the most out of this experience.
First rule: friends and host family make it better. I think that I am very lucky to have met such a great family: they include me in whatever they do and they organize many trips for me. I went to Wellington, to a rugby game and to their ‘bach’ (holiday house) at Mokau, a piece of paradise. Moreover, I have long talks with them and this is the best way to share opinions and improve your language. 
Friends are friends: whenever you feel good, they are there to share happiness with you; when you feel sad or you are homesick they are there to support you and to make you feel better. No matter if they come from Europe, Asia, Africa, America or if they are Kiwi. Just make friends!

The best time I had was on a 3 day North Island trip. We visited fantastic places (Hobbiton was my favourite one) and I spent all day long with my international friends. I couldn't ask for more for my last week here. Thank you, Anna, for driving us there and for being so nice to us!

2020 is a special and unusual year for international students, though: the corona virus has messed up all our plans and flights, that’s why many of us have to fly back to our country earlier. As for me, this fact made my experience even more interesting and challenging. Latest: I have to take 4 different flights and 1 train, just to go back home! It’s challenging, isn’t it?

Last but not least: the international stuff is awesome. Nobody could do their job better: they organize thousands of trips for us and whenever we need them they are available for a talk. I don’t think that all the international students of the world have as many possibilities as we have here at Wanganui High School. It’s like being in a big family where everybody cares about you and about your concerns. You are doing a great job and you made my experience the best ever. Thank you!
