Kia ora. 

I’m Rin. I’m a year 13 student.  I come from Ibaraki in Japan.  I love being here in Whanganui, because I met a lot of wonderful friends here and a wonderful homestay. I really like my home stay.  I have host mom and one host sister.  I love the people. Host mom is very  kind and she is funny.  I’m happy to come to this home stay.  My host sister is a international student too.  Her name is Ploy. She’s so cute and kind, and she has a lot of many good things.  I like playing volleyball.  I had been playing volleyball for 6 years in Japan but I played volleyball in Whanganui. It was a good memory. I will never forget that I played volleyball in Whanganui.  It was awesome for International team.  My favourite class is CNZ class, because I had a lot of experience in Whanganui.  I have trip every Friday.  I leaned something Maori culture or native tree, bird, food.  I enjoyed CNZ class.  My best thing is Tongariro crossing. It was awesome trip.  I liked the view and watching nature.  I like to breathe the clean air.  I felt was like a calm.  I like here in Whanganui. New Zealand is so good country.  I am happy to stay in Whanganui. I will never forget the special time I spent in Whanganui.  I am grateful for many things.  Thanks for lot of encounter, thank to friend, thanks to teacher, thanks to host family, thanks to my family. It is full of many thanks.  I love Whanganui in New Zealand.
