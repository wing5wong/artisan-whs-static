As a graduate of WHS, I’m so incredibly proud of us. Because of WHS, I am at where I am today. One of the great things that I’ve learned from my time at WHS was this; “Dream big and always chase dream!” in which lead me to travel to the USA to complete my master’s degree and working towards my ultimate goal to become an entrepreneur one day. With what’s happening the world with racial injustice, social reforms and pandemics, situations are not easy. 

As an immigrant, we came to a new country to experience great things and achieve our goals to be successful and, with what’s happening, I can totally understand how frustrated and stressful it can be. It’s hard but we aren’t defined by the virus. There isn’t a stamp on us with the label “coronavirus graduate or coronavirus student”. We’ve fought through more than that. We entered a new country and came out as different people now completely different world. If anything, we can handle almost anything thrown at us. 

Everything that you are experiencing, learning and accomplishing will change your life. Have faith and always dream big! Anything is possible for those who believe that. Work hard and seek towards your dreams. Because you are worth it!
