This Level 3 course will give the student the opportunity to gain Achievement Standards and Unit Standards with a focus on communication skills. This course is not primarily based on literary texts, as are the Achievement Standards Level 3 English courses. Unit Standards are available to students, including the introductory career pathways exploration, US4251, used as a future focus at the beginning of the year. The standards are internally assessed so there is no external examination component.
