**Purpose:**

To extend students musical skills from their previous learning in Year 9. Students who have not completed Year 9 Music course may apply.

**Content:**

This course is for students who have learnt an instrument for one year (in Year 9 or from an outside teacher) and would like to further their playing skills as a musician. Students will also have an opportunity to make music with technology and learn theory, to prepare them for Year 11.

This course is also for students who **already** play an instrument, having had at least two yearâ€™s tuition. Students will partake in class bands, ensembles and performance opportunities will be given such as Rockquest/Chamber Music contests. These students will learn to use technology and advance their theory skills, to prepare them for Year 11.

**Assessment:**

Achievement based on theory, composition and performance skills.
