**Purpose:**

To explore, understand, use and enjoy the English language and its literature, communicated orally, visually and in writing, across a range of contexts.

**Content:**

These students are working towards Level 6 of the English curriculum. The course is structured around making meaning of ideas or information we receive (listening, reading and viewing) and creating meaning for ourselves or others (speaking, writing and presenting).
