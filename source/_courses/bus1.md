Business Studies involves the exploration of accounting, economic and business concepts and models to make sense of society and solve problems. Akonga will build knowledge, skills and values needed to navigate and participate in the economic world. They will learn how participants in the economic world make decisions, and they will analyse how these decisions impact on sustainability. Akonga will learn that decision making is necessitated by scarcity and that decisions are informed by a variety of cultural perspectives and lenses.
