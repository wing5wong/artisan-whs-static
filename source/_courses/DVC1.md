This academic course is for students interested in using the design process to facilitate critical thinking in the disciplines of product and spatial design. Students develop communication skills through exploring, refining, and solving design problems. Students develop practical skills in sketching, rendering, instrumental drawing and modelling, using both traditional methods and computer aided design, to communicate their conceptual thinking. Students will explore design influences and inspiration through the cultural lens of Te Ao Maori. 

This course has an external portfolio assessment.
