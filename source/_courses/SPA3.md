This course encourages students to engage in sustained communication and produce extended texts in Spanish - listening, presenting, interacting, reading and writing in wider contexts (e.g. education, media and literature, history, technology, environment). Students use language effectively to share personal perspectives, explore and analyse ways in which Hispanic language and culture/s are organised, and critically reflect on texts and cultural norms.
