 Digital Technologies brings students up-to-date with essential computer-skills, prepares them for a future with an ever-increasing focus on the use of digital devices, and teaches them how to act safely and responsibly online. This course also exposes students to the possibilities that Digital Technologies provides, allowing them to access top-end software and the skills they need to use it.



 Digital Technologies encompasses all areas of the digital field. This includes Computer Essentials such as the Microsoft Office suite, which are important for all career paths in the modern age. To foster creativity we have Digital Media, which involves visual design through photo manipulation and animation, using software from Adobe. Computer Science teaches problem solving and logical thinking skills through programming, which can then be applied to all areas of life. Finally, Digital Citizenship teaches students how to use technology responsibly, benefitting both their own hauora and the hauora of those they interact with.
