The purpose of this course is to provide students the opportunity to gain a National Certificate in Building, Construction and Allied Trade Skills. To do this students will need to gain literacy and numeracy credits, and study both BAC1 and one other approved Technology subject. The course is assessed by Unit Standards which require both practical and theory assessment. Students will undertake set project work and participate in a class building project. This course is most suited to those students who genuinely intend to pursue a career in construction. (Extension credits may be offered).
