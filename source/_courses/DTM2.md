To enable students to select and competently use the major MEDIA programs appropriately in order to communicate information. Advanced skills will be developed to allow the seamless transfer of information between applications as well as the ability to design appropriate layouts with the end user in mind. The use of media is rapidly expanding and approximately half of this course will be based on developing advanced skills in various forms of media use. This may include Website design, Print Media as well as the use of Video and Audio Media. Much of this will be based on using the Adobe Creative suite of software and Expression Web. Students will develop skills in communication, design, research and problem solving.
