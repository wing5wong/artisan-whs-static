This course covers the two major paths offered by Digital Technology.Â 

The Digital Media section of the course teaches students to design an outcome with people in mind, ensuring its suitability for those who will use it. These designs can be made for print, such as posters and board games; or they can be made to be viewed digitally, such as short films and interactive experiences.

The Computer Science section of the course teaches problem solving and logical thinking through programming. Students will use these skills to design a game or application, following a development process that ensures the program is functional and easy to use. Even if students do not pursue programming beyond this course, the skills taught will be valuable in any future pathway.
