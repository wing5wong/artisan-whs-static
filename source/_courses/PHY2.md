To prepare students for entry into the NCEA level 3 Physics Course. Collecting and analyzing experimental data, mechanics, electricity and magnetism, radioactivity. This course contributes towards the National Certificate in Science (Level 2). Physics level 2 is an intellectually demanding course requiring excellent study skills, the ability to ignore distractions in class, good literacy and mathematical abilities and good revision skills. Many of the concepts and knowledge needed require students to work independently. The ideal student has a mature and self motivated attitude to their studies. Success in the course requires a genuine interest in Physics as a subject and sciences as a whole. This course leads directly to Physics Level 3.
