**Purpose:**

Students explore how societies work, and how students can participate and take action as critical, informed and responsible citizens.

**Content:**

Students will experience a rich understanding of the unique nature of Aotearoa, New Zealand's bicultural heritage and financial literacy skills. Students will develop a variety of social inquiry skills which will enhance their processing interpretation and presentation techniques, including researching a New Zealand disaster and pandemic planning. Students also explore innovations and are encouraged to be innovative themselves.
