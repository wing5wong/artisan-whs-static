**Purpose:**

To develop the skills, knowledge and confidence associated with creating and performing work. Drama is offered as a subject at all levels in the school. Students can work towards national qualifications such as achievement standards.

**Content:**

In Year 9, we focus on extending personal skills such as communication, self-confidence, listening and co-operation. Students work in groups and are introduced to a number of theatre forms such as mime and improvisation. Alongside the practical work, students maintain a drama portfolio in which they evaluate their work and identify future targets.

**Assessment:**

Process-rehearsal work and written portfolio. Practical - performance based.
