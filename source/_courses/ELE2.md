This course is designed by the NZ Electronics Industry Training Organization aiming to produce the Technicians and Engineers it requires. This is an introductory certificate for people interested in electronics and who may wish to pursue further training and employment in this field. This course contributes towards the National Certificate in Science (Level 2). Electronics level 2 is a course aimed and designed for those who have an interest in pursuing a career in either the electronic or electrical trades or in professional engineering. The course has a large practical component but also requires students to be mature, self motivated and have good mathematical ability. This course leads directly to Electronics Level 3.
