Education for sustainability builds on knowledge that humans are negatively impacting the Earth and examines what is being done both locally and globally to prevent environmental issues from getting worse. Students will critically examine sustainable ideas and decide which ones they could implement in their lives. Students will gain an understanding of Kaitiakitanga and Manaakitanga while growing a deeper appreciation for the whenua around them. This course will give purpose to students and prepare them for a future in which environmental, social and economic sustainability become vitally important.
