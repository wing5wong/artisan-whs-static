This hands-on course will teach students about the impacts human behaviour has on the planet and critically evaluate what is being done by individuals, groups and world leaders. Using ideas of Kaitiakitanga and Manaakitanga students will gain a deeper appreciation and connection with the Whenua whilst learning the individual changes they can make for a sustainable future. Students will examine what local communities are doing and be actively involved in finding solutions to economic, environmental and social sustainability issues already present in their lives.
