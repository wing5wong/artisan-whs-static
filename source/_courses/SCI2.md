To provide a pathway towards Sciene related careers and other tertiary vocational courses. Year 12 Introductory Science is a spread of biology, chemistry and physics concepts in a course that is more accessible, although still demanding. The course requires the student to maintain a high level of concentration and effort throughout the year as the course is entirely internally assessed. Many of the concepts and knowledge needed require students to work independently. The ideal student has a mature and self-motivated attitude to their studies.
