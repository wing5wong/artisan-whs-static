This course is designed to either carry on from Outdoor Education Level 2 or as a stand alone. Students will experience the outdoor environment of the Central North Island, learning skills relating to Kayaking, Mountain Biking, Rock Climbing, Bushcraft and Water Safety. Students are required to have an interest in meeting new challenges in the outdoors and be prepared to work in a team. Assessment is by Internal assessment - written in class and practical demonstration of skills in an outdoor environment.
