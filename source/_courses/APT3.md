Students will develop a series of art works print exploration to gain a perceptual awareness about their own art.They will have an opportunity to develop original prints through the observation of contemporary practice and to develop and extend their ideas into finished works. The emphasis is placed on the use of a Visual Diary and drawing as a primary means of documentation. The achievement standard allows students to produce a systematic body of work that integrates conventions and regenerates ideas within printmaking practice.
