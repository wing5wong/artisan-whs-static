This academic technology course is designed for creative and motivated thinkers who are eager to explore and apply their skills in a hands-on learning environment. The course integrates a variety of materials and emphasizes practical project outcomes, complemented by portfolio work. Students at this level will engage in more advanced projects, empowering them to select topics based on their interests (subject to teacher approval). These projects will involve the development of a design brief, incorporating client input, and fostering continuous feedback throughout the creative process.
