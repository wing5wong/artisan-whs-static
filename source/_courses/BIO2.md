To prepare students for entry into NCEA level 3 Biology Course. This course covers genetics and evolution, cellular processes and all biology, microscopy and micro organisms, plus analysis of current scientific evidence in society.  This course contributes towards the National Certificate in Science (Level 2). Biology Level 2 is an intellectually demanding course requiring excellent study skills, the ability to ignore distractions in class, good literacy and essay writing ability and good revision skills. Many of the concepts and knowledge needed require students to work independently. The ideal student has a mature and self motivated attitude to their studies. Success in this course requires a genuine interest in Biology as a subject and sciences as a whole. This course leads directly to Biology Level 3.
