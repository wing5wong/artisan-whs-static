To prepare students for Tertiary Courses requiring a Chemical background. A more rigorous consideration of the chemical concepts encountered at NCEA Level 2. Topics include: Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table; Reactions; Organic Chemistry; Equilibrium Principles and Aqueous Solution Chemistry; Thermochemistry; Spectroscopy. Chemistry level 3 is a very intellectually demanding course requiring excellent study skills, the ability to ignore distractions in class, good literacy and mathematical abilities and good revision skills. Many of the concepts and knowledge needed require students to work independently. The ideal student has a mature and self motivated attitude to their studies. Success in this course requires a genuine interest in Chemistry as a subject and sciences as a whole.
