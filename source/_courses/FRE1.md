This course develops the five communication skills of listening, presenting, interacting, reading and writing in French in everyday contexts (e.g. home, school, free time, food, holidays). Students learn to understand and communicate information, ideas and opinions through different text types, as well as developing awareness and understanding of how French language and culture are organised.
