This academic course aims to develop students' Design and Visual Communication skills by using the design process to conceptualise, refine, problem solve and offer design solutions. Students will focus on the areas of product and spatial design to complete port folios that showcase sketching, rendering, instrumental drawing, while also having the opportunity to explore and use CAD and 3D printing.

This course has an external portfolio assessment.
