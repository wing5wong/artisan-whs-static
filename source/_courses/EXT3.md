External Studies is a supervised study period provided to students who are absent from school 1- 2 days each week on "course" eg. UCOL, Training For You, Ag Challenge etc as an opportunity to stay up to date with all course work. Students must be prepared to work silently on their own work. Abuse of this rule will see the study opportunity removed.
