* **Externally Provided Studies:** Students will be enrolled with external providers accessing a variety of units through distance learning. Units are bought from various providers with the work being undertaken in a supervised area. To be eligible for this programme you must have a proven record of being able to work independently. Studies are available in Carpentry, Agriculture, Radio, Butchery, Retail, Early Childcare and Animal Care to name a few. To find out more about this course see Mrs Howard.
* **University Studies:** Students must have the Principalâ€™s approval. Provisional entry to University (to be applied for by Dec 1) is required. This usually means a Level 3 subject has been completed in Year 12 to at least a Merit Level.
