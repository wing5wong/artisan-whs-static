This course is designed by the NZ Electronics Industry Training Organisation aiming to produce the Technicians and Engineers it requires. This qualification builds on the National Certificate in Electronics (Level 2) and is designed for people interested in electronics who may wish to pursue further training and employment in this field. The qualification has been developed for use in two training environments particulary for people who have completed the National Certificate in Electronics Technology (Level 2): - in senior secondary schools, where a one year course is offered at Year 13; - in private training establishments and polytechnics, where it serves as a pre-employment qualification for those seeking employment in the electronics industry, or as the first stage in an apprenticeship in the electro-technology industry. The course recognises skills and knowledge in the construction, operation, and performance of: - electronic programmable circuits, - electronic devices, - electronic prototypes. Electronics level 3 is a course aimed and designed for those who have an interest in pursuing a career in either the electronic trades or in professional engineering. The course has a large practical component but also requires students to be mature, self motivated and have very good mathematical ability. To succeed in this course students should also have a good understanding of Physics.
