Students will engage with the art making process as a young artist. Students need to have a strong independent work ethic as they are responsible for meeting deadlines and developing their own personal art practice. There is an emphasis and commitment to the use of the visual diary to plan, document and reflect on their personal approach to art making. Opportunities provided cater to differing strengths and weaknesses for students. The initial standards focus on research and the establishment of a personal aesthetic and symbolic language. The following standards focus on developing an art practice that allows instinctive decision making, flexibility and expansion of initial ideas. They will have an opportunity to develop original art through the observation of contemporary practice and to develop and extend their ideas into finished works. By the end of the year students should be able to generate, develop, extend and clarify ideas to a resolved point and have an intimate understanding of the creative process and its potential. The standards provided and the structure of the year will provide a solid foundation for future development in the creative and innovative fields.
