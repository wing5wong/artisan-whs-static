To prepare students for Tertiary Education Courses requiring a Biological background. This course covers genetics and evolution, relationships between organisms and their environment, human biological and cultural evolution, contemporary techniques in Molecular Biology or Biotechnology and the effect of environments on a human body. Biology Level 3 is a very intellectually demanding course requiring excellent study skills, the ability to ignore distractions in class, good literacy and essay writing ability and good revision skills. Many of the concepts and knowledge needed require students to work independently. The ideal student has a mature and self motivated attitude to their studies. Success in this course requires a genuine interest in Biology as a subject and Sciences as a whole.
