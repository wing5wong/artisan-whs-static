LSCR is offered in every subject line. There are no credits in LSCR but students are given the extra time and support in order to gain the available credits in their other 5 subjects. LSCR is aimed to assist students who may have a specific learning difficulty such as dyslexia; dyspraxia; dysgraphia; Aspergers and so on. CRHS students may also need support from the LSCR and any other student who is finding time pressure a problem to them achieving their credits.
