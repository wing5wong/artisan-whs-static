My name is Keki F D Colaabavala, people know me as Keki, and I am a current board member.  It has been my honour and I am humbled by your choice of electing me to serve on the WHS board for the last 3 years.  I have a son in Year 13, who is currently the Deputy Head Boy, while my other son is in Year 10.   My daughter was a full time student at WHS, having been the Academic Prefect for 2018. She has since achieved a scholarship from Otago University as well as a full scholarship from Auckland University. 



We came to Whanganui In 2004 from Whangarei, with a plan to work for 6 months and move on. During those 6 months we fell in love with the place and the people so stayed on, left the company and set up my own business.  Still here in 2022.  This is my home. 



In my role as a Financial Advisor I have travelled extensively all over NZ, especially the North Island. Over the years I have owned and operated various successful businesses, some which have been sold.  My work has helped me to understand the best way to move forward as a team. 



I am passionate about education and wish to make sure every child at our school can reach their highest possible standard in educational achievement.  I wish to ensure that every child can deliver extraordinary results.  I will bring my own unique set of skills and experiences to the board.  As it doesn't matter how many resources you have if you don't use them properly it will never be enough.  I sincerely believe anything is possible with a positive mental attitude.



I will work to ensure the success of our school and a bright future for our children.  We need an education system where all children are expected to succeed and one where we all take shared responsibility in ensuring this happens.  As a current member of a school board I believe I can make things happen - and can make a difference. 



Thank you for taking the time to reconsider me as your representative, it is a privilege and pleasure to serve on the board.
