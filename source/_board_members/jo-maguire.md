I am the Deputy Principal at St Johns Hill School and have been a teacher for over 25 years, working in both low and high decile schools. I work with families, whanau, teachers, our community and agencies every day to support them on their learning pathway. 

I am married to Paul, who is a former pupil of Whanganui High School, and we have two daughters attending Whanganui High School in Year 10 and Year 12. 

I have the health and well-being of the learners as a high priority, especially with the increase of digital technology and the upcoming changes and negotiations in education.  I want the best education for our learners at Whanganui High School.  My job involves working with the New Zealand Curriculum, School Policies and Educational Guidelines and the processes that can support students, staff and whanau. I will continue to ask appropriate and challenging questions for you, and on your behalf. 

The importance of the LIFE values at Whanganui High School is an integral part in supporting our learners to be citizens that contribute positively to our community. This is my second term on the Board of Trustees.  In the past three years I have been active in the changes that have occurred e.g. Principal employment, Graduate Profile consultation and the school uniform review. I have been privileged to continue my learning on the Board of Trustees working with the excellent staff, students and community of Whanganui High School.  I look forward to the next steps we embark on, for a better education for all.
