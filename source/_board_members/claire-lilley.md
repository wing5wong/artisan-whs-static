Hi, my name is Claire Lilley. Let me tell you a little about myself.

I am a working mum of 3, with all that that entails – perpetual taxi driver, snack provider, and general butler - I am never more grateful to live in Whanganui than when I have to get three, differently interested children to their various clubs, sports, and social engagements each day! We emigrated to Whanganui from the UK around 7 years ago to give our children the experience of a different lifestyle and culture and to push us out of our comfort zone. We planned for it to be just a year but the sunshine, the people, and the landscape of New Zealand had us trapped. Moving across the other side of the world was always going to be tough but we have had amazing experiences and made such wonderful friends, this is now our home.

My working background is over 20 years in arboriculture, with experience in the private sector before moving into Local Authority as a Tree Officer in England, and continuing here with Whanganui District Council. I manage the trees that we have here in Whanganui and have responsibility for the cemetery service as well as lots of other parks related work. It’s safe to say that people either love or hate trees and I often choose an imaginary job when asked what I do, to avoid the inevitable tree conversation!

I have previously been a School Governor in the UK, for a primary school and only left that role when we moved here. I enjoyed the varied nature of the discussion and the experience it provided. I felt more connected to the school and the decisions that were made and I would like to be a voice contributing to those issues. I currently have two daughters at Whanganui High School, who are, of course, mortified by this nomination but I don’t have to work too hard to embarrass them so at least in this instance, I would be contributing to the community .
