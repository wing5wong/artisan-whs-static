I am a local family man and business owner of Q-West Boat Builders based in Whanganui.  I have also been involved in various governance roles over the past 12 years across various business sectors, I am particularly passionate about education and supporting youth into meaningful employment through trade training.  

I previously served on the Brunswick School Board of Trustees for two consecutive terms, with three of those years as Chairman.  

I currently have a daughter in Year 11 at Whanganui High School, a granddaughter in Year 9 and another daughter due to start in 18 months’ time.

I am also currently Chairman of Whanganui District Council’s economic development agency, Whanganui and Partners (W&P), responsible for growing the district’s economy.  A large component of W&P’s role is in the education space which gives me good insight into what needs doing in the future.

As a trustee on the Whanganui High School Board of Trustees my aim is to add value to what I believe is one of the best schools in our region.  I bring considerable experience to the table, particularly around sound governance, leadership and career futures, particularly in trades.
