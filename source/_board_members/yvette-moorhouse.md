Kia ora, my name is Yvette Moorhouse. I am married to Grant, and we have two children; Jakob (20, who attended Whanganui High School, with being the Head of Sport in his final year) and Chelsea, a Year 11 student who is currently attending Whanganui High School.

I have been in the education field for 28 years, with the last 6 years having the honour of being the Principal of Fordell School. I bring a positive attitude with experience in education, leadership, Boards, and a recognition for how important the role a school plays in guiding and supporting our children into their future. I believe a large part of our children being successful learners and citizens is quality education with a recognition of what each student excels/shines in; the partnership between home, school and the student being a key component. I am keen to help build on the many successes and opportunities that Whanganui High School is known for and for it to continue developing and improving into the future.
