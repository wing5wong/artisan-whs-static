"When you’re called for, you step up," is pretty much the motto my parents instilled in us as kids. This has led me to serve for my student union, university and school boards, a football and a pony club board and currently as a member of a trust that runs the Dutch museum in Foxton.



During my career, which started in 1986, I have been a teacher, Head of Department, Team Leader (as part of SLT), Dean and TIC. In these capacities I have assembled many skills and plenty of experience in how to help a school community be the best they can be.



I seem to be someone who loves meetings and enjoys the process of making decisions. 
I hate wasting time and even more…to have my time wasted by others.  Having said that, during meetings I always ask questions and speak my mind and I am sure there are people who think: "oh no, please…"



I will do my best to represent the staff in a way that they feel heard, respected and cared about.  You may not always get what you want or how you want things done, but I promise to take you and your points seriously and if needed take them to the Board and have them addressed.
