I am Whanganui born and bred and have been living here on and off for most of my life.  In 2014 we relocated back to Whanganui partly for lifestyle, but primarily because of the availability and access to high quality secondary school education.

I am married to Karen and we have four school-aged children, currently a son at Whanganui High School in Year 10 and a son and daughter to start in 2020 and 2021 respectively.  Our eldest daughter is Year 13 at Girlsâ€™ College. 

We are both self-employed, running our own successful businesses, I am director of an engineering consultancy, working in industrial capital project development.  Karen is a chef and owns Honest Kitchen.

Since our children started preschool I have been active in education governance.  My previous experience includes being a member and President of Whanganui Montessori Preschool Association for eight years, and Board member of Fordell School.  I have a strong understanding and experience in the requirements and expectation of governance and how a Board of Trustees effectively supports the Principal and management team of a school.

I look forward to having the opportunity to play an active role in supporting the continual delivery of quality education for all our children.
