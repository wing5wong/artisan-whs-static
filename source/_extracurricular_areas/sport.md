Whanganui High School offers a wide range of sports to our students.



We also offer a Sports Performance Programme. This programme targets a selected range of students and offers a more advanced training and support, that will allow them to reach the next level of their athletic performance.







##### Sports Performance Pathway 2025 



**Fundamentals Pathway**  
Every student at Whanganui High School has the opportunity in Y9-10 to access a quality fundamentals programme to equip them for sport.  
Every junior who signs up for the programme receives support to develop their levels of coordination, balance, agility, flexibility, and muscle and joint stability to engage in sport. Presented with a play rather than a competition focus. 




**Senior Pathway**  
Senior students who are focused on their sport have access to quality advice and support to manage their ongoing development. This is the performance component. Winter (April-September) general conditioning/athleticism. Summer (October-March) athlete focused. Also, part of the development will be leadership and coaching.  


**Pathway Goals**  
Promote the programme in the Y9-10 level to students who need support to develop in their sport, to then be able to achieve at an advanced level as a senior.  
The focus at junior level is to grow an all-round “athlete”, at the senior level to progress to a performance level.
