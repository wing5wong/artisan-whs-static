Whanganui High School offers a wide range of sports to our students.



We also offer a Sports Performance Programme. This programme targets a selected range of students and offers a more advanced training and support, that will allow them to reach the next level of their athletic performance.







##### Sports Performance Pathway 2024 



**Junior Pathway**  
Every student at Whanganui High School has the opportunity in Y9-10 to access a quality fundamentals programme to equip them for sport. 
Every junior who signs up for the programme will receive an adequate level of coordination, balance, agility, flexibility, muscle and joint stability to engage in sport. Presented with a play rather than a competition focus.

**Senior Pathway**  
Senior students who are focused on their sport have access to quality advice and support to manage their ongoing development. This will be the performance component. Winter (April-September) general conditioning/athleticism. Summer (October-March) athlete focused. Also part of the development will be leadership and coaching. 

**Goals**  
Promote the programme in the Y9-10 level to students who need support to stay in sport or who have transitioned out of organised sport. Focus is on being an ‘activity club’ not sport specific components and students will maintain physical activity and sport will be accessible to them if desired.
