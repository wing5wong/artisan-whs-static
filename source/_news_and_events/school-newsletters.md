On Tuesday 31 May, Whanganui High School is hosting a moderation meeting which will be attended by staff from most of the secondary schools in the district. This is an opportunity for teachers of NCEA subjects to compare their marking of scripts. Students will be released at the end of period 4 - 1.50pm. Buses will run at the normal time, and the Library Homework Centre will be open as usual until 4.30pm.
If you have any questions please contact the School.
