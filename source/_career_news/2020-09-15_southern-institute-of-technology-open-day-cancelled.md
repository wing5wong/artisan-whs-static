Good morning everyone,

I am contacting you all to let you know that our 2020 Secondary Schools Open Day that was scheduled for Friday 25 September at the Southern Institute of Technology unfortunately has had to be cancelled.

We apologies for the on-going changes and uncertainty this year.

If any student or smaller groups would like to visit the campus, we can also arrange a campus tour. I have attached a copy of our “Booking a Tour” form for anyone who is interested. See attachment above.

Once again, we apologies for any inconvenience. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards

Shelley
