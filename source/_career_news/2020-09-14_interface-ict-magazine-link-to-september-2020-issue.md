# INTERFACE ICT Magazine - Issue 102, September 2020

**Welcome to another digital edition of INTERFACE Magazine. We’re excited to bring you the very first, exclusively digital copy of the magazine.**

Inside this issue, we explore how the Rocket Challenge is taking off at schools across the country. Find out how it’s engaging young minds and showing them just how cool and exciting science, technology and engineering can be!

Also, we find out how QR codes are being used to understand Māori Myth Characters, what’s being done to protect students during online exams and how a computer game is helping kids learn Bible stories. Plus meet ‘Amy’, iQualify for School’s new Artificial Intelligence-powered Mathematics tutor.
