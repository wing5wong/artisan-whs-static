University of Canterbury is aware the Covid-19 lockdown has impacted senior secondary school students this year, and that many will be anxious about their Year 13 results and achieving University Entrance. As a result, I would like to outline some pathways on offer, including a change to our Discretionary Entrance requirements, to support school leavers this year. I have also included an update about our STAR programme.

**Discretionary Entrance**

Students who completed Year 13 in 2020 and who don’t meet the revised University Entrance (UE) requirements due to the impact of Covid-19 can apply for Discretionary Entrance for 2021 study if they had an exceptional academic record in Year 12. These applications will not be processed until results are released in January 2021. We encourage all students to attempt to achieve UE in the first instance, however, if this is not possible the following criteria can be used:

NCEA:

* 72 credits at NCEA Level 2, including a minimum of 14 credits in each of four subjects (three of which must be approved subjects) and a minimum of 60 Merit and Excellence credits.
* Achieved the literacy and numeracy standards for University Entrance.
* A supporting letter from the school Principal (or nominee) is required.

International Baccalaureate:

* Minimum International Baccalaureate score of 24 points but must not have been awarded the International Baccalaureate Diploma.
* A supporting letter from the school Principal (or nominee) is required.

For more information on this pathway, including how students apply for it, please view the Discretionary Entrance section on our [Admission and University Entrance webpage](http://crmlinker.canterbury.ac.nz/c/6/?T=MTUzNjk4OTk%3AMDItYjIwMjY4LTEyYjBmNGFhMGU4ZjRhN2JhNjk4YmRhZmVkM2FkOTU4%3Ab2ZmaWNlQHdhbmdhbnVpaGlnaC5zY2hvb2wubno%3AY29udGFjdC0wZWQ5Y2IwZjZmYWRlNzExODE2NmUwMDcxYjY3NWM5MS0wOGEyMDE5NjlmODg0NTM0YjE2NGEyMDU5ZDA2MDg5Yw%3AZmFsc2U%3AMg%3A%3AaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FudGVyYnVyeS5hYy5uei9lbnJvbC9lbGlnaWJpbGl0eS8_X2NsZGVlPWIyWm1hV05sUUhkaGJtZGhiblZwYUdsbmFDNXpZMmh2YjJ3dWJubyUzZCZyZWNpcGllbnRpZD1jb250YWN0LTBlZDljYjBmNmZhZGU3MTE4MTY2ZTAwNzFiNjc1YzkxLTA4YTIwMTk2OWY4ODQ1MzRiMTY0YTIwNTlkMDYwODljJmVzaWQ9NDUyYzRhNjAtYjJmYi1lYTExLWE4MTMtMDAwZDNhY2FjZjRh&K=vjzw9_j_loMzFvTvyUt9IQ).

**Certificate in University Preparation**

The Certificate in University Preparation (CUP) is a one-semester programme of study which helps students develop the skills necessary for successful university study, including:

* Subject knowledge for pathways to degree programmes
* Study and time-management skills
* Oral and written communication skills for a variety of contexts
* Analytical, critical, and problem solving skills
* Information literacy skills

CUP is recommended for students who need to gain University Entrance.

**STAR Programme**

The University of Canterbury’s STAR Programme is an extension and transition programme for keen and capable secondary school students. Our [STAR Programme website](http://crmlinker.canterbury.ac.nz/c/6/?T=MTUzNjk4OTk%3AMDItYjIwMjY4LTEyYjBmNGFhMGU4ZjRhN2JhNjk4YmRhZmVkM2FkOTU4%3Ab2ZmaWNlQHdhbmdhbnVpaGlnaC5zY2hvb2wubno%3AY29udGFjdC0wZWQ5Y2IwZjZmYWRlNzExODE2NmUwMDcxYjY3NWM5MS0wOGEyMDE5NjlmODg0NTM0YjE2NGEyMDU5ZDA2MDg5Yw%3AZmFsc2U%3ANA%3A%3Ad3d3LmNhbnRlcmJ1cnkuYWMubnovc3Rhcj9fY2xkZWU9YjJabWFXTmxRSGRoYm1kaGJuVnBhR2xuYUM1elkyaHZiMnd1Ym5vJTNkJnJlY2lwaWVudGlkPWNvbnRhY3QtMGVkOWNiMGY2ZmFkZTcxMTgxNjZlMDA3MWI2NzVjOTEtMDhhMjAxOTY5Zjg4NDUzNGIxNjRhMjA1OWQwNjA4OWMmZXNpZD00NTJjNGE2MC1iMmZiLWVhMTEtYTgxMy0wMDBkM2FjYWNmNGE&K=z3Dxa-eFbhPQrnMFvquVCg) has been updated for 2021, including the course list and how to apply to the Programme.

Key things to note about the STAR Programme:

* Senior students from state, independent or integrated secondary schools can apply, including internationals and over 18s
* Students do not need to have achieved NCEA University Entrance (or equivalent) yet
* On campus and distance study options
* First year UC courses in 50 subjects
* Discounted tuition fees, some as low as $0 (zero), because the STAR fees of some courses are covered by UC Colleges
* Credits are transferrable to a relevant degree at UC and usually other universities as well

**Year 14 Programme of Study Students**

With recent media attention about an increase in students returning to secondary school for a Year 14 programme of study, the STAR Programme would be an excellent addition to their year. By enrolling in a STAR programme while on their Year 14 programme of study, this would allow them the opportunity to make a head start on their tertiary degree study while at school and provide a stimulating challenge.

If you, your staff or your students have any concerns or would like to discuss any circumstances, please do not hesitate to contact myself or one of the Liaison Team members.
