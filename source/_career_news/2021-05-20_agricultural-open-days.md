The following Farms Stations and Training centres are holding Open Days or Taster experiences. These opportunities are well worth taking up as they not only provide students with a face to face look at what is on offer but the various training facilities often look more favourably on applicants who have attended their open days. Students are encouraged to approach community and service groups if they need help with the costs of travelling to these places. These training farms cater for a wide range of academic abilities and with small classes/ intakes per year, students that may have struggled at school, can really excel. A practical start to a student’s career path can help give insights into the industry and motivate them into further studies as well as preparing them for on farm work.
