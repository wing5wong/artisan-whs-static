PORSE Education & Training (NZ) Ltd offers secondary schools seven early childhood education unit standards (level 2 and level 3) selected from the **NZ Certificate in Early Childhood Learning and Care (Level 2)** and the **NZ Certificate in Early Learning and Care (Level 3)**.

The programme is correspondence based with two key programme options available; **Tutor Support Visit** and **Distance Learning**.

PORSE prides themselves on successfully working with over 130 schools nationwide and look forward to continuing our work with schools across New Zealand in the STAR and Gateway space.

Details of both programme options can be found on pages 5-9 of the attached Prospectus.
