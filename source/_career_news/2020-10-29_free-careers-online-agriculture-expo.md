**Our aim**

This initial webinar is a broad-brush approach.  We aim to run further specialised webinars on different facets of the industry, catering to those who are interested in specific fields. In this next step, we will also include on-farm and industry work experience placements.

New Zealand has a world-class agricultural industry with a reputation for leading-edge agricultural practices and we need young people to keep it moving forward. Using our knowledge and networks, we want to assist school leavers transition from secondary school to the world of work in agriculture. 

 

**Agri Training** 

Agri Training grew from a group of committed farmers and rural leaders who came together and identified a gap in the training market. They were looking for young people who had the depth and breadth of knowledge, coupled with the practical skills and experience to help drive our primary industries to even greater heights.

Agri Training delivers extensive and comprehensive knowledge and experience to trainees so when they graduate they are trade qualified and skilled in all practical and relevant areas of modern-day farming demands.
