Victoria University is very proud of the achievements of these students and I am sure that you and your staff will also be very proud of them. Some schools demonstrate this pride by listing the Graduates’ names and qualifications in school newsletters or magazines, as I am sure your whole community will be interested in these results.

As you are aware, we are continuing to work with your school, and we are looking forward to welcoming a new group of your students to Victoria in 2021.

Yours sincerely
