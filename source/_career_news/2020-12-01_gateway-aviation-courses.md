There are now two Aviation related Gateway Courses that are available for students:

 The ‘Aviation Gateway **Flying** Programme’

And

The new ‘Aviation Gateway **Aeroscience** Programme’

The Flying Programme continues (as normal) delivering a good general course for students to discover the world of aviation (Recommended for Year 11&12) , while the ‘Aeroscience Programme’ is a more demanding course specifically targeted at Year 13 students (from Semester 1 - 2021) who may be interested in an Aviation Related Career or the skill set that may be gained from the more specific subject matter.

Specifically, the ‘Aeroscience Programme’ delivers the following:

 Students do not have to want a career as a pilot – they can still engage in the programme and gain a minimum of 20 NCEA Credit points at Level 3.

Students who may wish to become a pilot can obtain up to 33 NCEA Credit points at Level 3.
