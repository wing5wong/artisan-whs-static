**A message from the Southern Institute (SIT):**

First of all, we would like to thank you all for your understanding during this time.

Southern Institute of Technology (SIT) would like to extend a warm invitation to all your senior students, to attend our Open Day which will be held on ***Friday 25th September***.

SIT Open Day will commence at 10:00am at our Tay Street campus and conclude at 1:30pm. The programme (which is particularly targeted at senior students and their parents) will include campus tours and the opportunity to attend various workshops and a mini expo.

Herewith, please find attached a copy of our interactive Open Day booklet which contains all the necessary information and timetables about the day.

Everyone will receive a printed copy at the Open Day upon arrival.

Due to Covid-19 and the on-going changes in Alert Levels, we require all attendees to fill out a registration form for contact tracing purposes. This can be done by clicking the orange “Book Your Tour Here” button on the interactive poster, which I have attached as well.

We look forward to hosting your senior students at the event and presenting them with a variety of study options to assist them on their career path.

We are doing our best to navigate through these uncertain times, and if anything changes, we will keep you informed.

Yours sincerely,

SIT Marketing Team

Southern Institute of Technology (SIT)
