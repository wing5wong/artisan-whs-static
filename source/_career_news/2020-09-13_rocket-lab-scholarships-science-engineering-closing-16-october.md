**Rocket Lab Scholarship are now open**!

The Rocket Lab Scholarship covers up to $20,000 in tertiary fees for one outstanding student to pursue a degree or course in STEM education. The recipient is also paired with a Rocket Lab mentor, giving them a rare opportunity for one-on-one experience with a world leading space and engineering expert.

The Rocket Lab Scholarship is open to applicants across the country to encourage and support the next generation of science and engineering innovators. However, applicants who can demonstrate a strong connection to Māhia and the wider Wairoa District in Hawke’s Bay – where Rocket Lab’s New Zealand launch site, Launch Complex 1, is located – are prioritized and strongly encouraged to apply.

If you know of any past or present students who may be eligible, or anyone else in the local community who may be interested in applying, please pass along this message to them.
