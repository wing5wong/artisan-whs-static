We are excited to introduce the New Zealand Helicopter Training Academy, which will be operating from Whanganui Airport from October 2020.

NZHTA is part of the Mid West Helicopters group and provides the only helicopter training facility in the greater region. Our Chief Pilot Dean Lithgow and CEO Shannon Carr will be overseeing the operation, and look forward to seeing young pilots ignite their passion for aviation.

We will be offering Private or Commercial Helicopter Pilot Licences, operating alongside NZICPA (New Zealand International Commercial Pilot Academy) who will provide ground theory courses. Our purpose built classroom here at Mid West Helicopters’ hangar will provide students with specific helicopter instruction, allowing students to see our helicopter operations in action. Students will also have the opportunity to fly from Mid West Helicopters’ operational bases at the foot of Mt Ruapehu and the Tongariro National Park, and the Ruahine Ranges. The New Zealand Helicopter Training Academy aims to provide students with a professional, hands-on training experience to prepare them for a rewarding career in our dynamic industry.

***Our NZHTA Prospectus is attached above.*** We believe that this exciting new facility will provide your students with yet another opportunity in our wonderful city.

We look forward to any enquiries and working with you in the future.

Kind regards
