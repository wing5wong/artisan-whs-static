## Mobile Phone Rules

### In August 2022 we installed signs in all classrooms and common areas around the school advising the following:
- To help student learning, mobile phones and AirPods (or similar) are not allowed to be used during subject class time.
- All visible mobile phones and AirPods must be handed in to your teacher or relief teacher at the beginning of each subject class period.
- At the end of the period, your teacher will return the mobile phone or AirPod back to you.

### At the beginning of November 2023 these exact same rules were extended to also include all Form Time classes.
From the beginning of the 2024 school year, mobile phones will need to be ‘put away’ into school bags during student break times. If a staff member sees a student with a mobile phone out during break time the staff member will politely ask the student to put the phone away into his or her school bag. The staff member will say ‘thank you’ and then move on to continue with his or her own break time or active supervision duty. There will be no enforcement process if a student does not follow this polite instruction from the staff member.
